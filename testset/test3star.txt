well what can i say
ive had this unit in my truck for about four days now
prior to that i had a garmin t nontruck gps
one of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature
what i would do is using a map i would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route otherwise like most gps s it determines what it thinks is the best route
i could add up to  vias or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take
multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the garmin
however it was not truck specific
and considering i am now hauling strictly hazmat i wanted something that would take that into consideration
after perusing various forums review sites and wordofmouth my choices boiled down to the garmin t or the rand mcnally intelliroute tnd   even though it was quite a bit more than the garmin i chose the tnd  for several reasons
the main one being the extra screen size and its ability to coordinate with the rand mcnally truck atlas and also its ease of updatingnow on to my first impression of the tnd   it seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit
the first thing i noticed was its very slow to boot compared to my old garmin
whether this is unique to the tnd  or is common amongst all truck specific gps units i cannot tell but its really not that big of a deal
the second thing i noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth
that might explain why the manual available via the tnd dock is well over  pages long  there is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit
the next thing i noticed was the complexity of entering routes
as previously mentioned i like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias
that was a big no go with this unit
while you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as userfriendly as my old garmin
furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen as i could with the garmin
totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have i went online and verified through an expert source connected with rand mcnally that no that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point
unbelievable
also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging
for a unit of this price and feature laden i find this totally unacceptable
i am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the garmin t
i really do like this gps the screen is magnificent and the volume is awesomeanother thing ive noticed which i do not think is unique to this unit is some of the weird routing that it does
ive never owned a truck specific gps before but after playing with this one for a couple of days i get the impression that what rand macnally and the others that use navteq has done is take a plain old car specific navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map
in most databases there is not a  thorough listing of every road in the country
what i mean is that this unit will route you down roads you dont belong on
today while coming home it tried routing me on several   ton county roads
what that means is that a truck is limited to  unless the road is posted at  tons
county roads do not have that restriction listed in the rand mcnally road atlas so i believe that is why it is not listed  also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific
however id be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of navteqanother bone i have to pick is the pois
not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated
i think the garmin at least the ones that i have used are more current
it would also be nice if i could add my own poisto sum it up i will keep this unit a little longer to see if i can make it workable
if not i will go back to garmin
i like the concept and i like the unit but at this point ill have to say i am somewhat unimpressedproslarge screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumeconsinability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated poi informationnontruck specific routingscostthis is a good beefy  amp charger but it covers two outlets on a power strip
its ok in a regular wall outlet
the best thing is it uses a standard usb connector so it can charge more than just a nook i have a kindle fire hdit does a and charges a dead nook in a few hours
it does so with a lot of heat compared to most wall worts
i have a dual charger where  port is a and the other is a for total output of a that doesnt run as hot as this
and i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubit does the job adequately as its designed to
just hot
i would always unplug it if not using even though it cools off because of the amount of heat made
the nook hd runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait but not so much when charging
i guess its better to have it at the pluggo to target or barnes and noble instead and pay  which is still a huge markup considering they make the thing for  cents
this is the worst option if you need one of these
its price gouging pure and simplefor the price you cant beat it
mine didnt come with any of the screws for the tv but luckily i had some leftover from another mount so i didnt want to bother returning it
also not sure what they mean by tilt but mine doesnt
the arm extends in and out as said tv swivels left to right but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation
otherwise cant beat it for the price as in targetbest buy etc these are going for wanted the monitor off of the desk so we mounted on the wall
i would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well but for the price this unit does the jobi gave this mount  stars to start because out of the box and mounted on the wall i really liked it for my daughters room
the ability to move her  tv around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed additioni subtracted  star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum about  feet away from the wall more star fell off because now that the tv is mounted the mount seems to sag even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it
that parts not the problem the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself it seems no matter how many washers you use it just does not make full contact
also if you move the tv to a new position the mounts seems to want to fall in that direction on its hinges
so it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it movesotherwise it works i guess
but for  id rather have a stationary mount that i never have to worry about
i would not set a tv larger than a  or so on this
i just dont trust iti had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my  led tv in my bedroom
other than that seems to work finepros easy to setup
supports many different vesa formats
has some articulation
sturdy construction
can be installed by one person wo too much effortcons cable guides fall off easily
the joints are a bit too stiff you really have to manhandle it to get it fully extended and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again
so far i have not noticed any wear from this firm pullingpushing but i worry because it is only attached to the studs buy  boltsi bought the uint for a   tando
i couldnt get the parts to line up so i bought another fixed typemy flat screem computer monitor is very light and didnt need such a heavy duty mount
the product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my  ledthis device is somewhat weak even for the  inch tv weighing only lbs that im using it with
after some adjusting its working oktoo heavy and poor weld quality lot of blow holes in welding though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder
i think this is is not well designed by experts
hope no calculations are involved in making it
just copied the shape forms some other manufactureri have  swivel mounts and this one is not the best
if you dont use the swivel feature frequently or dont place it where it may be bumped it will do the job
i prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have two arms extending from a longer wall bracket
these more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices
also look for a feature which allows the tv bracket and tv to be lifted off the swivel arm more convenientlythe product is good and as describedi have a  vizio tv and somehow this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my tv
i still managed to mount my tv just fine but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount wont be able to carry itbut the full motion swing feature is amazing
especially if you are in a larger roomthe mount itself seems fine it just didnt work with the phillips tv we boughtthe x arm things did not line up and if they did then the x parts would have covered the holes for the inputswe ended up using one we had had around hereseems to be built well though and sturdyit is a solid mount and i doubt that it will ever fail to hold the  led tv that is mounted on it
my only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the tv is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans up to  from one side of the tv to the other  but for the price i can live with thatthe mount works but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there
purchased because it was on sale
just okits a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together for the price it works
but for the quality id go with cheetahi purchased this mount for my  inch lcd tv
installation was easy  the trouble i encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder
make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall studthe arm of the mount sags after i hooked up my in
lcd tv to the mount
my tv is within the weight limit of this mount less than lbs
but the arm still sags due to the weight of the tv
i guess as long as it supports my tv the sagging shouldnt be an issue
it just looks funny from the side
i do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break offoverall for the price this mount is a great deal and works but i would suggest purchasing it for flat screen tvs less than  inches
i would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a  inch tv at mostwe had to shave a little off the wall mount plate to get this product to work for us but after doing so it has served its purpose on our  tvreceived the product and got it installed today
for the most part i am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts
the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for  per piece
once i put the bolt into the lcd tv and mount it with the plate i found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms
is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nutsi saw this product on amazon and thought what a great deal because this is a gb version of the same tablet that barnes  noble is selling for  dollarsit mostly works and the screen is great for reading books
i have had problems with the browser since  weeks of owning and the apps have issues loading and playing some games
if i could i would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new onewhen bn designed this one they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features
as a result what you get is pretty limitedits a fairly sturdy device by feel and not difficult to hold for a while and use
the quality of the screen is pretty good and its not difficult to read for extended periods of time so long as youre not out in the sun anyway almost all lcd screens perform poorly therevery little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with thatyou can sideload content from any source that uses adobe drm for epubs and also epubs that dont have drm at all
this means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple
you can install an overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdriveyou can root it to get access to more apps
if you want to run a more pure version of android you can go for either putting together a cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from nookandroidbn gives away a book and an app every friday on their blog so thats worth checking in on regularlyon the whole this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semitablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computerstablets up with viruses by being carelessness
its lockeddown state works in your favor from that perspectivefor more general tablet use this is a pretty poor choice
also as of mid the later devices nook hdhd have been radically marked down so if youre going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap
otherwise itd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more fullfeaturedand what is it
why its an outdated bn tablet
a friend of mine purchased this after seeing my in hd tablet but wanted the smaller in version
it works fine for what it is but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem as nice to her as my in concerning screen qualityand thats because this is not the new nook hd with a x screen resolution and upgraded hardware firmware and software which has been on sale everywhere since the bn fathers day sale was extended indefinitely
this is the old nook color with a standard x resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and osiow this is the old model so if looking for that new on sale tablet by bn like my friend was well this aint it
she will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initiallyas for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was but comes up short these days periodi own the original nook eink reader and the nook tablet
i have been happy with both
when i read all the wonderful reviews about the nook hd i couldnt wait to buy one
the main reason that i bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where i need at least  point type
the availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome
i use the tablet not only for reading but to watch netflix movies while on my exercise bike
the nook tablet works okay for that but the larger display of the hd seemed that it would be an improvement
however there are several problems with the current editionthere needed to be at least one more font size at the highend
i had to choose between too small and too largethe sound level was too low even with headphones
i could not find a barnes and noble application to provide better control over the volume
there are a number of thirdparty applications which used to work on the nook tablet that are now locked out by the current os versionso in spite of the beautiful display i reluctantly returned the hd to my local store
when planning future upgrades
i would advise barnes  noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities
we are not an insignificant market segmentlets just say this will never be ipad or anywhere close to it
that said it is never meant to compete with ipad anyway
if you compare this with amazons fire its a closer comparison
frankly this is better than fire
hands down nt has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags
the complaints about nts wallgarden os restriction is very trueso is amazons fireits not the end of the world just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for  that is rather spiffy
this doesnt get a star rate because inch form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the os lockdown
personally in tablets is too small for serious computing usage
it is a good reading form factor though
i cant give this a star rate because bns app store is too smalleven when rooted googles market place is filled with crappyjunk appsnot so happy with it
i have had my nook hd for approximately  months
during that time i have ordered  books of which i have read  those read were placed in created shelf a or shelf c depending on whether i liked it or not
everything was working fine until they did a recent update and then it was like a tornado was let in
locked up my nook until i downloaded the update and then found all my shelves gone and books missing from my library
called bnshelves gone and will have to create again plus move read books back into and missing books from library have to be downloaded again
one book was not found and after an hour on the phone bn said the publisher stopped making it available for the nook is available for the kindle and will issue a refund
fortunately i kept the email confirmations of all books i ordered so i could give them the order numbercustomer service is lacking at bn
i had to make multiple calls until i was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing bookone other thingupdate seems to have changed screen brightness as before i could read it out by the pool and now i no longer canin fairness i will also mention that i have a kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections but didnt lose any books and can still read it out by the poolboth have wifi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelvescollections gobetween this and other popular competitors there isnt a lot of difference in hardware
the software and usability is noticeably different though and thats where you should pay close attention
i bought my wife the nook tablet for christmas and she uses it a fair amount
i havent heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones ive heard most oftenthe barnes and noble app store is a joke
i looked through it for about  minutes and barely ever saw a free app
many popular apps and games are there but usually you can only get the paid version
adding insult to injury sideloading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device this will void the warranty
i didnt expect sideloading to be a given really but if you block those apps you really need a decent app store to make up for itthe sd card slot which many people may not ever use is in a pretty odd spot
its not really hard to pry back the cover but since youre working with a microsd card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot
if that wasnt annoying it is definitely annoying to load your pdfs or whatever from the sd card once its inserted
for someone who isnt really techsavvy it isnt obvious how to read those files
the reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the sd card is insertedon the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work
although i think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a gridlike app drawer theres little organization to the home screen
you can drag icons around to and from the dock but appsbooks dont lock to any kind of grid on the home screen
some of us who are more anal retentive just wont stand for two icons being less than parallel
you can see a better view of your media by opening the library app which is a nice app but i find the contrast displeasing further emphasizing this is a tablet with ereader functions or vice versa maybe
basically the cohesion isnt there and you start to wonder with all of the restrictions why you didnt just get a regular tableti still havent rooted my wifes tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough shell let me do it
otherwise if youre not planning to root the nook beware of its restrictions and browse its app store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a dealbreaker
this is an ereader first and a tablet second
if youre satisfied with its ereader capabilities im sure youll be happy with this devicehonestly i was really just interested in getting an ebook reader so you wont hear me whining much about how the nooks functionality was crippled by bn
what tipped the scales towards the nook instead of the kindle which was the other main contender for my money was its compatibility with the epub file format
its very tightly integrated with barnes  nobles store and as long as youre only interested in either books from that retailer or sideloading your own books via usb cable youll be satisfied with this device
unless youre willing to root it you wont be able to sideload apps from a computer and you also wont be able to access googles play store or amazons app store
definitely a dealbreaker if youre looking to buy a fully functional android tablet but it works well for my own purposesupdate i find my review written about nook hd included here for an entirely different model tablet
amazon or bn this is unethicaldfnook hd overviewgreat screen no cameras weak speakers crappy battery life compromised android os but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast beautiful display
plus it has a microsd slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing
and of course its original purpose to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and bookspluseswide range of browers available
i have  on my machine
all browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks
for example firefox will play video in hd and does not redirect to mobile sites
tint and zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file
with several browsers installed its easier to get around site restrictions
firefox has an addon that autodeletes cookies
chrome allows spoken search inputsthe world of  android apps can now be accessed on nook hd including big and nice apps google earth skype youtube in hd adobe reader wifi analyzer wifi fixer essential wifi tool google maps best solitaire ever by mobilityware and free run games
custom moving backgrounds on nook hd home screens are funannoyancesin two months i have not figured out how to add a browser link to nook hd home page
some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage but it never works
it must be that the nook hd os does not allow thispoor battery life by test i get only  hoursadroid apps normally just suspend so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an applicationaudio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps
with no os support for shutting apps down i often have to resort to a reset to silence thembuiltin email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages
apps like fasthotmail can provide workaroundscreen capture is clumsy pushing home and vol requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushesnook hd not really useful for music sans headphones because sound volume on speakers is relatively lowsetting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain
half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed
the nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge but i find this hit or miss it only seems reliable after a resetfile directories can be accessed via usb but have some annoyances many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of os directories
nook hd allows deletion of its standard user directories like kids bn files only to later write them back againtablet does not reliably remember some settings
occasionally i find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when i look the setting has changedno way that i have found to add personal data for quick entry
updatebluetooth keyboard problem solvedi have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet blackberry playbook but i could not get it to work with nook hd
it would pair fine but nothing happened when keys are hit
i see others complaining of this too
finally i solved the problem with an app called blueinput available on play store
it now does the pairing not nook os and you select the bluetooth keyboard using switch keyboard icon
updatefix for adding web link icons to the home page
some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to home but this never seemed to work in nook hd
i think i now understand the source of the problem
the default nook hd launcher with carousel ignores them
the work around is to install the nova launcher and it will show them on the home screensi bought my gb bn nook new for 
at  list price i would say its a ripoff and im still not thrilled that i spent  on itpros  expandable storage via microsdreliably plays mp video and ebook filesnetflix and hulu plus apps are reliable and have good interfacesreliable but not particularly longdistance wireless antennaebright screen with good color contrast and resolutionresponsive touch screengood battery lifecons  web browser is slow unreliable and crashes oftenlimited closed operating system with expensive applicationsheadphone jack is lowrent  too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakershorizontal  vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization optionsmade from cheap plastic  microsd cover slot fell offno way to rent movies or tv episodes from nook storehardtouse music player that has problems playing some mps that other devices can play just fineits good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a touchscreen portable computer

great for reading books and netflix
battery life  read catching fire and mockingjay on a single charge
email and web are decent too  nothing specialconsthe bn nook os and the bn app selection are both terrible
the nook os is counterintuitive and not user friendly there is no back button
take a toll of how often you use the back button on your phone or android device and youll realize how annoying the lack of this simple commonplace feature is
you can hit the n and go back to home any time  though often i wanted to go back not start over
the selection of apps in the app store are laughable
i literally could not find a single app i wanted even searching apps that they advertise like comics for nook not installed
not available
i found a few apps for  that i have downloaded for free on itunes and google play android marketrecommendationbuy this na tm  gb nook to android bootable microsd card for the nook colortakes the good hardware of the nook tablet and replaces the useless os with trusted full android
read the reviews they are all true
before i bought this card the nook was basically useless and frustrating  now i have an android tablet and since it is not rooted still have warranty too though i recommend squaretrade
check my na review for more infoupdate i have had this tablet for over  months now and love it
i have had no issues and all my friends and family want one
note i use this exclusively with the na card in android mode
na recently emailed me with the update from gingerbread to jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent
i cannot recommend this companyproduct enoughthis nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view
the only draw back is the battery life is terrible
i am charging this unit twice a day
my former simple touch only needed charging once a month with the wifi on all the time
i would not recommend this producti purchased both the kindle wifi and this nook the original and tried them out during the return period
while there were things about the kindle i really liked better screen contrast and many other features that other reviewers on the kindle site had written the one thing that made me choose the nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library
havent been back to the library sincenow here comes the nook simple touch nook st ereader
it is just now starting to show up in bn stores not on amazon yet
i was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet
i bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out
it has the same eink pearl screen as the kindle so the screen contrast is no longer an issue
and wow has the user interface improved over the original nook
which i thought was clunky the entire eink pearl screen has full touchscreen capability
on both the kindle and the original nook i felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read instead of using the buttons on the kindle or the lcd touchscreen on the original nook to highlight and select the desired ebook
on the nook st the library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device both library and purchased
touch the icon and the ebook opens
turning the page
touch the screen on the right side of the page to go forward or the left side to go back
or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page
or use the buttons built into the frame
want to page quickly through a book
hold down the page turning button
need a word definition
touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up
the user interface resembles that of an iphone or ipad with the icons virtual keyboard and the physical home button
it even has the slide to unlock feature like the iphone
the touchscreen on the nook st is infrared it senses the heat of your finger again like iphone so a light touch works just fine
i found that on the original nook sometimes it would take multiple touches on the lcd screen for the device to recognize a commandi returned the original nook since the nook st is so much better
note that the nook st doesnt have g connectivity a web browser or an mp player
if you want all that buy the original nook
if you dont require all of these features and would like a basic ereader with an intuitive touch screen interface then take a look at the nook stthe nook st is just beginning to become available only at bn right now but i suspect that amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soonheres another plus for the nook whether it is the original one or the st
the kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks
nook uses adobe epub which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format including most public librariesan ereader without eink
reallyereaders are devices dedicated to reading and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eyestrainby introducing a backlit ebook bn removed the key point of ereadersif you need a device that has a backlit screen and can afford a  device why wouldnt you pay the extra  to get an ipad which does the job much more efficientlyplease correct me if im wrong because i really dont get the point of this devicethanksi knew about the nook color even before it was released and i was really excited about this ereader because i own a kindle  and im part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future
the nook color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen vivid view technology brightness adjustments really nice web browser and mp player etc
so i decided to order one with blueproton cause they ship it to canada and i paid  dollars more than the actual price at bn and expedited shipping taxes on top of that
i didnt care i just wanted my nc cause honestly im just tired of buying aaa batteries for my clip light to read my kindle  in bed
i noticed i never read in bright sunlight im an indoors type of reader and i also like to browse while i read mostly wikipedia and google and the kindle we browser is primitiveanyways i got the nc promptly i was super excited but then i tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didnt recognize the units drive
nothing popped
i had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there
i went to a friends house and nothing popped on his computer either
a third try at a different laptop and same thing nada
i went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden i started seeing smoke coming out of the usb port and a smell of burned toast
really strong
i knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out
everything else worked perfectly but the usb was pooched
i returned it and they were very professional about it but said that they found nothing wrong with the device
i bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware
anyways i said i didnt want that unit back
now here i am with no nook color nobody else sends it to canada
im contacting friends in the us so i can send it to them buying it straight from bn and then they can mail it to me
its just weird that at this day and age we still cant have items shipped internationally even when were willing to pay more money for that luxurynow im again using my kindle like crazy since its all i got and it never fails
but im still gonna buy the nc no matter what
i just dont know if ill sell my kindle  in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now hehei think that for  us dollars the nc is the best ereader in the market
right now the kindle still leads and the ipad is coming strong but  will be the year the nook color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two
if amazon doesnt come up with a color kindle with touchscreen i strongly believe they will be the betamax and vhs of the s
but i really like the kindle and if they came up with something like a readers tablet i would use it instead of using bns
however that still hasnt happened and jeff bezos says he doesnt want that to happen just now
so ill purchase a nook color and be happy with iti bought it for my pdf library and to surf the net on the go
it turns out that it wont read nonwesternlatin pdf documents unless a word document transformed into a pdfi purchased two certified nook colors directly from bn for my kids to read ebooks on and for some entertainment on long trips drs appts etcthings i like about the deviceversatility now has netflix great little device for entertainment as well as readinguser interface  much improved following the last update both navigating the device itself and bns storeoption for expandable storage handy for music and mpsability to make the device kid friendly the internet can be disabled and purchases can be made to require your account passwordthings i dislike about the deviceread in store feature only for certain books and virtually no kids books
the impression i got from bns webpage was that it was for all ebooks
this was the main reason why i picked these up instead of waiting for the kindle fire to be released
major disappointmentcharger cable sucks
the cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable and is very easy to bend and break
one cable is now broken at that spot and the other is close to it
these cables are easily replaceable so not a huge deal but i expected better quality  also the power adapter is quite bulkydid not update automatically
i had to manually install the most recent update allowing me to disable internet and install netflix
it was relatively easy to do following directions from bns webpage but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itselfloses battery life fairly quickly while on standbyno free games  limited games maybe apple spoiled meprices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle i have not made direct comparisons this is just my general impressioni will try and see if i can lend books through my local library this may allow me to use it more for its intended purposeoverall the device itself is quite good just not for what i had intended it for in store reading with the option to purchase the book in print from the storeif i had purchased the device for myself however it would have been returned
my kids do enjoy reading on it playing angry birds watching netflix etc
so i will keep it for their useeditthe nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour
i did contact bn i initially took my nooks into a bn store for assistance and was referred to their tech support  number
so much for the in store tech support  i was able to recieve two new cables under warranty thoughi am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable and the inability of bn to solve this issue instorei am the occasional reader but i bought this for tablet capability
it can be rooted in about  minutes to have app store
once that is done you can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering bn store
its still there but not right in my face
default browser is ok  but i prefer dolphin hd
its much more than half and ipad at exactly half the price
plus when used as a reader its just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose
i had a pandigital novel that i got for xmas that completely died in  weeks
i took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that i can remember making  the nook color
the novel is pure garbage compared to this device
android  is so much better than   i also couldnt get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything
spend the extra  and get the color
save the extra money from the ipad
i was considering archos  but i couldnt find anywhere to actually play with it
plus given their history i had decided against itgoodnice screen  capacitive touch  strong wifi decent battery life nice cpu   mhz   mb ram  ipad only has   supposedly tons of free apps available very reasonably priced  portable  barnes and noble magazines  very reasonably priced at  to  an issue microsd slotbad  minor complaintsthat silly plastic thing in the corner mono speaker micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot doesnt come with android marketoverall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a whileupdate
couple of small annoyances randomly reboots instead of sleeping wireless doesnt come back up sometimes after rebooting
still very happy with it though
sleep issue apparently also happens to those who havent rooted
im sure it will be fixed with updateupdate  i am very unhappy with barnes and nobles many attempts to update my firmware without my permission
they have tried twice and didnt succeed
i believe that avg antivirus is stopping it
they got my girlfriends and we have the same nook that came with same firmware that was flashed with same mod
the only thing i can think of was avg must have stopped it
they got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine
she wasnt running avg and mine was
its the only thing i can think ofwho else does that
i have items from sony microsoft nintendo htc sprint etc and none of them update my property
who do these people think they are
well they wont be updating my firmware and now i wont be buying books from them either
anyway its an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be boughtside note  i had ordered a touchpad from bn back on august st
not only did i not get one they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email
not very nicei have had my color nook for three  months
its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is  sure not a tablet you cant get free apps if you want an app from your tv station guess what if bn isnt selling it you cant  get it thats why they sell these things  so you have to buy from them
i found free ebooks on the web and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook
 is very good
the  pages change size of their own freewill which is very annoying and the battery life is awful if you use wifi you have to recharge every day
yahoo mail is awful on the nook gmail is fine and hotmail is too
as far as the web email is all it good for
i wish i had bought and archos tablet all the things i am doing now plus a lot morei picked this up as a gift for my teen son
it looks great and makes a nice web browser
i checked and found that it has  million free books
actually more like  as there are repeated titles
after setting up my account which would be changed to my sons after christmas i tried to download a free book sherlock holmes the invisible man but bn requires a credit card number on file to charge the  price toheres my problem my teen son isnt getting my credit card number
theres no work around either
i suppose that the bn site would require a confirmation password as amazon does but personally i prefer entering my cc upon a purchase instead of creating a running tab for myself or my sonid love to give this to my son but it requires that i give him access to my cc number to download free books and the temptation to be financially irresponsible is just too great
if anyone has had their identity or ccs stolen you can see why this is a deal breakera decent color ereader but pretty much worthless for internet use
the thing will only connect in the bn store
apparently its extremely finicky about the wifi hub that it will connect to meaning most wifi hotspots will not work
theres lots of online discussion of this defect in the colors design
i bought mine last summer
and now you have the option of the kindle fire
but ive just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wifi too
so apparently theres no free wifi lunch with these relatively inexpensive android e readersi dont usually jump on new technology or new products but  on seeing the vibrant color display of the nook color nc i took one home for a weekebook prosvery quick to setup for ownership and downloadingquick page turns and refresh ratesan accelerometer quickly permits reading in landscape or portrait modeafter resizing text you dont have to scroll down to see more text on the same page  you just sweep your finger across the screen from r to l to see the next part of the pagethe touch screensensitive  fastyou can lend books to other nook owners for  weeks and it really is a loanyou cannot access the book while offered or loaned

dont touch it while reading or   a menu pops up for things like brightness settings text size highlighting dictionary share options find button content button  a slider to zip to a page quickly or   the page might turn or   the page will scroll vertically or horizontally
you must hold the device by the margins outside the glass
great if you hold by the edges when you read a real bookall others take notice as my hands did tire of holding a book this wayyou wish after having seen how you upsize or downsize pages on the ipad pinchspread  fingers on the glass that you could do the same hereon the one i bought i saw some very irregular activity related to the menu flashing on and off without my having touched the screen  also the virtual keyboard would occasionally act up eg  a single key press of n might give me nnn or nmm or even niinthe virtual keyboard requires you to press a  button to get numbersweb browser prosgreat color and resolutionon almost any monitor youll have to scroll updown to read long text passages

when i took it in to bn it played innocent and behaved well
later at home again it went nuttyfinal verdict
not for me
perhaps a later version with better battery life maybe color eink a version of the browser that supports adobe flash a more behaved virtual keyboard with number keys above the letter keys
possibly a carrying case that keeps my fingers off the screen while viewing
technology gets better and more affordable for late adoptersbought mine a few days ago and returned
it is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and i will expand on it shortlyst this is more a hybrid device than an ereader
an ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format
examples of good ereaders kindle of course nook st generation and sony
nook color besides allowing you to read let you browse internet listen music play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff
of course there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple bookso whats cool or niceinternetfull color internet experience with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser
touching the screen and keyboard is like an ipad or similar tablets but is comfortable enough for short emails or using wikipedia or googlepdf supportwith nook color not only you can read pdfs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode
this feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading pdfs is your only or most important taskfull color screenpretty obvious
if you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them look no further
the resolution colors and screen is perfect a real pleasure to read using a nc
depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only leaving images apartbut
not everything is perfect no landscape mode for booksyou have landscape mode while reading pdfs but not while reading regular epub books
this was a real surprise to me a bad one
landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines
with no landscape mode you are forced to read every book as is and for a hybrid table which costs more than  in my opinion it is not acceptable
my kindle  rotates and its  cheaperlcd screeni must admit this device has less glare issues than ipad or galaxy but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to lcd again
reading on a nook color for several hours is not easy for your eyes
and forget about using it at your pool or outdoors unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle the glare will bother you while reading anyway
indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway specially after long reading sessionsheavyfor serious readers those who read novels fiction books technical books or more than  or  weeks per month please think again before buying
with about oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you dont have a desk or something to put your nc on your choices are using your tummy chest lap or knee as additional support
a deal breaker
being a kindle  owner i know what im talking about
you can hold a kindle  with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at allbatteryonly  hrs of continue use average
i bought it a tuesday read for about  hrs that day went to bed leave it on but in sleeping mode
next day morning turned it on used it  more hour and soon after that the device was at  of battery life
i barely used internet and brightness was at minimum another important point about battery and charge is that the nook color must be charged via wall not usb or computer unless screen is off which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process
the adapter is also proprietary so you cant use your nook st gen adapter or the one some androids use i dont like that i dont like proprietary stuff
the more standard the more common the better to replace or findno zoom or ability to enlarge imagesan image with wrapping text around in that cool book
if you cant read it or maybe is too small then sorryyoure out of luck
you have at the moment of this review no way to click expand or enlarge that image
if you read mostly novels this means nothing to you
but if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all
i cant believe this simple feature is absent and i can only hope for a future fix via firmwareandroid based but not full access to android marketshame on you bn
 this device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked
as usual this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills actually it has been but warranty will not be honored and its a hassle to keep it up to date after official bn firmware upgrades in case you hacked or rooted the device also you wont be able to read books instore if you root it
while bn keeps selling the unit without android market or a restricted version of it this device will be like having a magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets
so much power with androidlinux but you just cant use itno read me featurefor a  tablet i would expect this feature
the kindle its not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the english books for yousummaryif you read a lot portability and battery life are important for you forget about nook color
if you are a casual reader looking for a fun device and distractions internet games etc nook color will fit your bill
just keep in mind that nook color is not a true ereader though but more like a tablet with reading abilities if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern this can be a great buyfor now i will pass
my kindle  is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do let me read or read for me my favorite books
most novels and technical books are not in color so i dont need a tablet with internet access to enjoy them why bother theni got a nook color for my anniversary and returned it within the week trial period
it worked fine it just was rather pointless
i have a kindle but i wanted something more functional that i could read in the dark i love my kindle  the nook was in addition to not as a replacement
to make the nook into a true tablet you have to hack it
we did that and it was ok but still not able to access the entire android market and some apps just didnt work right
i did a factory reset and returned it then ordered an actual android tablet which i have not yet received so i cant compare them yet
there wasnt anything wrong with the nook really
it was just a lot of money for what is basically a glorified ereaderi bought the nook color for its intended role as an ebook reader
i have a kindle dx but it has trouble with many of the tabletop rpg pdfs i throw at it and the gb is a tad small to hold my gb collection
the builtin pdf reader is worthless slow to open files the kindle dx had no trouble with and wouldnt even turn pages
i jail broke it install a mostly vanilla image of froyo and installed adobe acrobat and from there it shined
page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented read notreplaced the kindle dx quite wellits a tad small for anything more indepth than book reading and angry birds
even casual web browsing can be a pain and its place as a bastard hybrid of a phone os on a  tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds
maybe once if
android tablets take off well see mobile pages more suited to them
the huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacketin the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust
itll probably end up a gift for someone who doesnt mind lowerend electronics
these days while the kindle fire looks good im waiting on the market to mature and windows  tablets to ship before i go looking againthe onoff button is located so that you will frequently turn off tbe machine by accident
the power button should be recessed
same for volumn controlnot quite a fullfledged tablet not a dedicated ereaderand thats ok with me for 
i had my first two nookcolors replaced the first due to a sd card holder spring that failed after  days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on
customer service had me on the phone for about  minutes and took me through two factory resets before i finally convinced them to replace my second unit
note that all replacements of defective devices are refurbished not new
finally i am experiencing what barnes  noble had in mind
nookcolor  works great and now that i have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should i am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be with a really solid ereader and nice adds like pandora and other apps as well as wifi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the nookcolors primary role as an ereader
i really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my itunes library straight off the sd card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps i bought
standard quality mp video files play smoothly and most were converted to that format via third party software on my pc my videoconverter
the app store is still underdeveloped and i really wish this had g capability so id have an excuse for taking it with me more often but at such a low price compared to g tablets i have become very enamored of this machine
the questionable quality control a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints and if i had not encountered the quality problems i mentioned this would have been a solid  or star review especially considering the price vs competing tablets because it really is in the tablet category especially with android  froyo installedi am new to nook color and bought over  books on the day i purchased the device naively thinking that all publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook the  letter a images incrementing from very small to the largest
much to my dismay when i later had time to go through all of the books id purchased and play with text sizing and font options i found that this was not the case
indeed the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairmentsmy plea to barnes  noble publishers amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs
in the us alone there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged made bold underlined etc
my feeling is that corrected versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacementspersonally i have visually impaired people in my family and i will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizesnook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses so for now i rate it  stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented
i know i speak for many and thank you for your time and considerationitll be gone soon and i cant say ill miss it
our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so i got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the kindle color nook
it doesnt overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as our kindle fires
text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy
one advantage the nook has over the fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the fires percent of book read
mrs spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percentsmy wife and i are both comfortable navigating the fire and barely had to refer to the owners e manual
i dont like moving around on the nook and that may be solely because id become used to the ease of the fire
trying to surf the web on the nook was very frustrating and watching movies or video clips on the nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion slow responses and freezes
we watch free tv shows on the kindle fire with smooth enjoymentthe fire was a gift to my wife from me
she loves it
if i were to buy a small device for reading id prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads
that method may preclude the ability to get free books it does on the kindle but its a circumstance id acceptin summary the color nook is pretty good as a reader
those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the nook on some childrens books and the option to have the book read aloud by the nook voice
as a web browser the nook  in my experience doesnt work as well as the fire doesin choosing between the two devices i chose the fire because i prefer the amazon site to bns like the vast number of kindle books on amazon and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books movies and tv shows that come with amazon primethe nook color is a reasonably priced device that will allow you to download multiple books and store them as well as access emailright now it only has one book in it and has not been used for email since we have three computers readily accessible
i had a dlink router which the nook could never lock onto via wifi so i changed the router to a cisco linksyn which solved the wifi problem
downlaoding books from barnes  noble is a little too easy once you set up an account with them and the books are somewhat expensive considering they are only electronic and intangible  for a  page bookthe nook color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lowsthe hardware on the nook color is very nicethe screen though not a super hidef retina like high end tabs is bright and great for books video comics etc
it feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy
a nice addition is the sd card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or if youre resourceful or purchase a nook  android card convert your nook into a fullfledged android tablet on the cheapthe interface in the nook color is adequate but not amazingbarnes and noble created their own flavor of android for this reader
while its not highly customization or super elegant its well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet media consumption
as noted above this reader can run full android quite well if modded and still run a nook applackluster appsapp support for this reader is very spartan
youll find some simple games netflix finally and a few others but its not a lot to write home aboutif you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading this isnt a bad buy if you can get one at a good price i wouldnt pay more than  at the moment
otherwise its a great android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a nook  android cardi recently bought a nook and when i bought it home for the first time i was impressed
the user interphase much improved over nook st gen was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list ui of the new kindle touch
holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the kindle touch desperately lacks
hardware and software wise the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use ereaderhowever when i started to look for books to purchase they were about investing if you were curious out of the five books i tried to find i ended up only being able to find one of the books i wanted
i purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for amazon and barnes and noble are but the truth is bn still has a ways to goi am aware the the nook supports epub which allows it to read generic pdf files something that the kindle cant do but one of the features i look for in ereaders is convenience
having to buy a book from google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my nook is not convenient
if only this device had the kindle store on itbottom line when you buy an ereader youre also buying into the manufacturers entire ecosystem
with the kindle youre buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer thats not going away anytime soon
with the nook youre buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the ereader spacetwo word recommendation research selection before purchasei hope ive helpedi bought this from b  n and had to return it back in june and they have still not credited me for the return
i have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch
i am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them
buyer beware where you buy your nook touchim writing my review in amazon because bn block my review arguinf  it  violates the terms of use of bn ironic dont you think  anyway this is my original review of the ebook readerthe readers is fine in generalpros nice physically materials best graphic user interface than kindle nice eink screen great speed of screen refreshing touch screen response is wonderfulcons physically buttons for back and forward are kind of hard to press no landscape mode i dont understand why  no web browser or rss reader app or something like that pdf reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has tables bullets images and other graphic different from text you can not delete move or rename files from the device user interface you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions this makes you waist a lot of time the device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at bn store
you cannot have access to that partition with or without computer in order to delete this purchased books you can not export your highlight or notes from the books
kindle is a step forward with this most have feature the reader does not have the option to lock the screen with a secret password or dots combinations like android phoness
remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device
 the home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the  sections reading now library and next readingsill make it simple
i loved my nook
i bring to school every single day and have sixtyplus books on there
its great because its light its portableit fits in my pocket
 and most importantly it has all my books at once
it can most definitely be read in direct sun and i was pleasantly surprised that barnes and noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare
you can side load any pdf or epub file as well as downloading books from the store
the book management is simply fantastic
the reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itselfhowever on day i picked it up and i couldnt unlock it
i wasnt very worried because the nook occasionally doesnt respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt
but it still wouldnt respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots which were the only thing the bn support line could offer
i feel dissapointed but ordered the new glowlight and hope that it will last longer because it was just great while it lasted
i hope you have a better experience with your nook if that is you decide to buy this older modelthis a second generation ereader
by adding a  gb micro sd card it can store more ebooks than ill ever own
most of my books are in pdf format
it has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an ebook in pdf form that i bought from forbescom
all these books display properly in pdf readers available on personal computersits other weakness is that it has minimal documentation
the topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questionsi dont read a ton so i didnt want to pay a huge premium for an ereader
i have an ipad but when i do read sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache
it came down to this the basic kindle and the new kindle paperwhite
when i really thought about it the paperwhite was more than i really wanted to spend on something i would only use an hour or  a week
i ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didnt have to be converted to mobi files which the kindle usesit wasnt quite as straight forward as i was expecting
i initially thought itd be like the ipad where you just drag the book into the books section of itunes and youre ready to go
i dragged the books onto the nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened
i found out you had to download ade and set it up that way
from there you have to add the books to ade then add them to your nook not a huge deal but a few extra steps compared to the ipadi also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the ipad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time it wasnt the most accurate
it also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computeri think the kindle is the same way as well thoughthe reading experience is great though
its not too bright and easy on the eyes
the nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile
library is also easy to scroll through once its on your deviceoverall i am happy with it
i mentioned its shortcomings but they dont outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience
from a reading standpoint id give it  stars just some other things that popped up that arent big deals but noticable
id recommend this to anyone like myself who doesnt do a ton of reading but still wants a simple ereader
if you are a more serious reader id probably spring for the paperwhitethis arrived as described packaged well and worked well
the only issue i have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be
i had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an ebook
whether it was from barnes and noble or the libraryit seems to be a limited device but it has potential  i think a good price it new should be about 
i have one as a backup to my kindle pw there are two pros the sd card slot and it can be rooted but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted
very very limited web browser no facebook or anything useful the browser on the the paperwhite is much better
it is a pretty well made deviceit is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhiteive owned the nook simple touch for about a year now and for the most part im happy with it
the rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up
the only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about  seconds
update about a month after the warranty expired the screen froze up permanently
i havent been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when i called tech support the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isnt working to unfreeze the screen anymore
when it worked i really liked it
i just wish that it still workedafter what i thought was a thorough research between the kindle nook  sony ereaders i took the plunge  bought the nook
what appealled to me most were the web browser  epub use to check out books from the library
however after fully charging the nook i took it with me for a weekend at the beach
i didnt bring the the charger because bn said battery would last up to  days with wireless off
well i found out the hard way with wireless on it barely a couple hours reading at night  in the afternoon by the beach
oy was i frustrated with nothing left to read  another night  afternoon left
lesson learned must bring charger everywhere
lost   for thisim not a fan of touch screens still love my trusty pushbutton cellphone
so browsing the web was a pain for me having to navigate around the screen with my finger
page turning was fine but i think ive overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant pageturning friction 
scrolling down  up also frustrates me  most of the time i have to swipe several times to get it to move
not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads  the response time was slow which made me think it didnt sense my touch so id do it again  it goes back all the way to the main menu
grrr
what a pain as i have to restart the store search  find the page againbn samples are horrible
they give you  pagesbut its the cover copyright dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story
not enough to make me want to buy a book
the closest bn is  hour drive away so i couldnt take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading instoreafter i discovered that i cannot organize books into folders that was the final straw
i read novels with racy titles my  yo
son wanted to read his classics on the nook but i didnt want to lend it to him because he would see all my books  potentially read them
this is a biggie for me so lost another features im happy with i was able to checkout books from my library  i was able to put my pdf books on the nook
yey
unfortunately my library just got into ebooks  have only a handfull of books so itll be a while until i can fully take advantage of this featurewell these are my personal experiences with which i now realize that i didnt do a thorough reasearch as i first thought lol
my faultbut i still like my nook though im no longer in love with it like when i first received it
ive also ordered the latest kindle so well see which one ill keep  im looking forward to the pushbutton keys on that lolpros very nice display  clear than sony prss
 star for thiscons touch screen not responsive navigation is not good
it is a stupid to have two screen for read and menu
waste spaces
software looks buggy very irresponsive even if updated the firmware to latest   star for thisfinal star most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion and most of it is accurate
the battery life is misrepresented by bn
 the only way you could possibly get  days out of the battery is if it is off
however  to  days is a real possibility so bring your charger or usb to computer cable
just like apple ipod the bn folks decided to use a nonstandard usb cable that appears to match the apple ones
this is a minor problem but do not expect to borrow a usb cable from someone while on travel
the included small charger worked very wellthe key thing is how does the nook function as a book reader
in my opinion it is adequate and no more
i downloaded a number of free books without any problem
i also downloaded some paid books form bn
 once again no problem
finally i downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer not the nookusing the free adobe software
using the usb cable to my nook i simply dragged the books to the nook and voila two seocnds later they were available for  days
so far so good
one could now rant about the interface soso or the fact that you should reduce the colorscreen brightness to about  to save the battery as well as turn off the wifi when not in use and so forth but how does it work when reading a bookif you are like me and read fairly fast most books will be a real page turners since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book
the print is clear
it is faily black on a slightly grey background some might say offwhite which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable
for the eyesight challenged there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning
the same is true of the kindle
page turning is easy and intuitive so not a problem
use the buttons on the side not the color interfacea big feature of the nook is the ability to add a memory card
well it is true you can do this but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired
the first time you try to open the nook using the nearly invisible tab you will wonder if you are going to break the cover
just be careful follow the instructions and all will be well
now why would you want to add memory
as it arrives the nook holds a huge number of books
you might want to add some of your work in pdf documents  this chews up space fast  and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best
get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the nook for books
changing the batteryright
perhaps at the end of life  to  years to save a service trip
by then the technology will be antique and you will replace the whole nook not just the batterya disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer
the kindle has this feature
the nook can be upgraded to also have a browser but then it is nonstandard and you might have trouble as bn upgrades the official firmware
perhaps bn will relent and give us email capability similar to the apple itouch
i can understand not wanting to overload att with too much traffic but simple text emails should not have been a problemfinally why would you want a nook in the first place
remember real books use no power are truly random access can be lent to anyone for as long as you like and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes
the only purpose i can see for having a nook is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch
well scratch the last since you can borrow and read books on your computer
the airplane travel or train commute is a biggie
books are heavy and bulky
carrying  books onto an airplane is a pain
plus hauling out your nook to read makes you look technically cool and for the short term is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger
the conversation might be interesting and better than the nookbook you were going to readwell ive written enough and am going to read a book that i just downloaded from the local library
ill try not spill my soup on the nook while reading and eating or it would become a soupernooki bought the original nook in aug  initially i liked it but i quickly learned that the battery life wasnt nearly the quoted time it lasts about  days for me  max with wireless off and the most powersaving settings
the einklcd screen mix was nice for navigation although i understand that the newer touch models will be more batteryefficient
despite this drawback it was so much more convenient than paperbacks
as much as i love the feel of books in a nyc apartment there just isnt all that much room for themthat nook lived for about  months until a part of the screen died  just black pixels
i called customer service and after a long painful process got it replaced
the unit i got was clearly a refurbished unit which wouldnt have bothered me had it been identical to the one i sent it
my original nook had a twopart screen this new nook had a onepart screen and its buttons squeaked when pressed
little did i know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect
as it happened this squeaking which made the buttons difficult to press also caused the pageturn buttons to crack just one month past warranty
needless to say i wasnt delighted
apparently the pageturn buttons cracking is a very common defect
so if you buy a nook remember this if the button squeaks and is hard to press it will break
return it while you can
not all the nooks are like this my old one wasnt so i recommend checking it outoverall    its a solid reading device but doesnt really compare to the newgeneration nook simple touchkindle touch devices or even the kindle  keyboard which i now also owni bought a nook today
the one and only reason i chose nook instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old kindle  is its ability to download books from the public library
tomorrow i am taking the nook back to best buy for a refund not an exchange
the nook is attractive and nicely packaged
i completely expected it to just work like my kindle did and still does and all of my apple products do
but like so many other reviewers here my nook never even got up and running before it croaked
first it would not complete the registration process
i have an active account on bn and strong wifi in my home plus this nook also has g so there were not any connection problems
then when i decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the nook worked it froze
could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting helpsupport on the bn website
it did not work
i do not want to mess with taking the back off using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out the fully charged battery etc
we should not have to do that on a brand new  product
so am taking it back and wont buy another until they improve the quality of the thing
i never had one bit of trouble with my trusty kindle and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for kindles inability to download library books
im giving the nook two stars instead of one because if it actually worked it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than kindle doesupdate went to return the nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go so did exchange instead
tonight charged and powered up the replacement nook so far so good
it works perfectly
registration was smooth and fast wifi connected easily with my signal downloaded a book quickly and navigation is a breeze
no problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update and theres probably some explanation for that so not a big deal
so i might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my kindle
love having the nook with its open format for library and other downloads
will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordinglyupdate returned the nook to best buy today and bought a kindle  through amazon
after exchanging the first defective nook then using its replacement for several days i found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to
there are a couple of minor things about it that i was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to but there is one problem design flaw
that for me is definitely a deal killer
one of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change
another is that the color lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading
and after a while i was not that crazy about the menu navigation either seemed like too many steps and screen flashes but probably could have gotten used to that too
i would not have rejected the nook just over those little quirks
the big reason that the nook was no way going to work out for me is again that touch screen display at the bottom of the device
it is like an ipad highly reflective
so what that means is that when the screen is off which it is most all of the time during reading you can watch yourself read
the black screen reflects anything in front of it almost like a dark mirror
that was a no go for me no i did not like it at all
aside from these annoyances the nook did well at everything it was designed to do
so will upgrade the rating to reflect haha that
i have to say that i am much happier with the kindle but amazon really needs to get with the program and let kindle use the epub format
they will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem it is that big of a dealyet another update
caved in and purchased another nook last week
i still love my kindle and prefer it over nook but just could not wait another minute for amazon to open kindle to epub for downloading public library books
so last week when bn had nooks for sale cheap on their ebay website  free ship gwifi noncolor refurb w full warranty i jumped on it
this refurb nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in janfeb
i am using the nook just for library books and it does what its supposed to do
navigation works well but seems like it requires more step than kindle
still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area
there is one thing that i do like better on nook the screen background is a paler gray than kindle making for easier reading in low light
i will keep this nook until amazon does epub then stick with kindlei wondered if this is designed solely for reading textonly booksmagazines
i have some books with i purchased are in pdf
plus i have some word documents which i have converted to pdf
both in my books and in my wordconvertedpdf files have lot of pictures
lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures
when i read them in nook the letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small
when i try to increase the font size it does not work
it works only for texts
i have never used kindle so dont know if the issue is there in kindle too
also the pdf pages are scattered all over the place
 page in actual pdf file appears as  pages sometimes with a blank page in between
not sure what is causing thismy nook does have a web browser but it only works with wifi not with the g
in g you can only interact with barnesandnoblescomthe touch screen response and userfriendliness are ok not great after dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use nowadaysgo for it and kindle if you are reading text only book with very little or no graphics
amazon and bn needs to improve their products and i am sure they willpay close attention
i would be very cautious about swallowing a few of the most helpful favorable reviews
pay attention to that quoted phrase
i strongly suspect many are paid reviewers or actually employees or someone connected with the addons for the nook
just a heads up
amazon loves to put the favorable insiders up front because the bottom line is sales and what leaves your wallet into theirs is the drivermy nook is okay for the  at my local computer store that wanted to get rid of them
its not a bargain at the prices we see here
if youre serious about a tablet then save up for a good one if you can
if not it should work for youmost folks are putting out honest reviews some whine artists some scammers some who just need to talk to someone
we cant do much about that but we can comb through and pick out what we might be able to trusti did such extensive research trying to decide between the kindle and the nook
i settled on the nook because i had read nothing but good reviews and the price was excellentpositiveit has a beautiful screen with great vibrant color
the adjustable backlight is great for night time reading and reading in the sunits lightweight and comfortable to read withnegetive i find it has many glitches
from having trouble unlocking my screen to having trouble getting the screen to even turn on so i can unlock it to having my kindle application crash every time i get to the end of the book
i understand that it is probably an application issue with kindle but having kindle compatibility was an absolute priority for me as most of my library is on amazon
furthermore my battery doesnt last at all
i have to power down my device every time i put it down otherwise by the time i pick it up again to read its dead
wont even last a day
ive figured out that disconnecting it from wifi helps it last longer but not nearly enough
i was used to an ipad that lasted almost a week without charging
this battery time is unconvenient and unacceptablethose are the main glitches that impact my experience with this device
i dont recommend getting this tablet
i would like to purchase the kindle fire and give this away as a gifti bought this nook hd in the summer for  from bestbuy
it seemed like the best value at the time for a gb tableti thought that it would be good for our trip to spain
we ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was itfast forward a few months of neglecting using the nook and the device will not even turn on
i keep thinking that i am doing something wrong but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to bestbuy after i confirm that i ordered the extended warranty its been a busy time for us
so needless to say i am not impressedupdatewell the nook decided to power on again when i followed the instructions to turn on a dead nook
i dont have the instructions right here but if you find them has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your nook to factory settings  and you wont want to do that if you have anything stored on iti will just have to see how it goeswish amazon instant video would play on it but redbox now offers an  monthly subscription rate for  dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streamingthat along with netflix give me two options for streaming videowe were very happy with this purchase at first but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months
the volume buttons no longer work and the volume cant be adjusted on the laptop so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problemswell it is nice i just bought the wrong one any ways it fits my tablet
and im still using itbought this to transfer video from some old equipment
sony ccdtrv hi videocam and panasonic omnivision vhs cassette player
its not fancy but does the job
i prefer to use potplayer to captureconvert the video over the included software which works ok im satisfied with this purchasei purchased this because i was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case and i love moleskine notebooks
the surface of the cover is soft not like a normal moleskine notebook
the top left elastic strap does minorly interfere with the operation of the on switch
it doesnt really bother me all that much though
i have had mine for a week or two now and it still has a chemical smell to it
be prepared to let it air out for a whilei have owned this for a month hoping to use it in meeting situations where ipad typing and other forms of note taking doesnt quite get it
i was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines
quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with
the cover holds the ipad in a fairly but not definitely snug mannerit is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the ipad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side
no big deal for a right handed persona note to moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite go kissoff
a better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly less smug companyi have had one of these different vendor came w a  yr warrantydied at  yr  months
i was unable to find anyone who repairs monitors like this too
great while it lasted but reliability is unclear search on yamaksasi monitor failure and youll see a lot of them die at just over  yr  i suspect a blown cap in the inverter from the symptoms
also runs unusually hot at full brightness both the screen and the power brick get quite hot
to be fair its a heck of a steal otherwise and the image quality and speed are terrific you must have a divd input not just dvii or any other format like dp or hdmi or vga dvid has a full rectangle of pins on the plug not two groups of pins
search on dvi connector and youll see lots of illustrations of the types if youre unsure
great for spreadsheets gaming etc
butit died prematurelythe dell axim x  mhz was released in  it still has a lot going for it its sleek compact and attractive its got bluetooth and wifi and a  mhz processor the fastest processor available then
but i cant imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in  it uses windows mobile  wm v which isnt supported by ms anymore
the current version of windows mobile is additionally dell has discontinued the axim x since  you will have trouble getting support from dell if you run into any problemsbut complaints about it being outdated aside the dell axim x has a few significant problems with it a problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out
there is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on a lot of users like myself have the problem with the builtin storage spontaneously disappearing
the ppc doesnt see the drive anymore its like it doesnt even exist activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items pathetic battery life
i can squeeze about  hours from the battery it comes with  and thats with bluetooth ans wifi turned off and the screem dimmed down on my x the powerdata connector completely broke loosei would advise you to pass this upits okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although i dont use it often so im glad i have it
but havent had great luck with dvds and not sure if wrong type disc or whati like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another
other than that it is okayitem description says nothing about this item being a dvdcd rw unit
however after reading reviews many said they were burning cds with this unit so i purchased itthe unit i received installed easy and was identified in  device manager as a sony cdrom dduawhen i opened my burning software no writers were recognizedspecs on this unit indicate writing function as naapparenty this company is shipping different items under this description as others have said that their unit was imprinted with dvdcd rwthe unit i received says dvdromits a nice external portable unit for playing cds and dvdsthis is not b a burneri made the mistake of abandoning my normal principal of you get what you pay fori was excited to find these so inexpensively and had planned to use them in my su master controller for photography
the quality batteries for this unit average around  each so the idea of getting four batteries with a charger cheaper than the cost of two normal batteries was just appealing to my green sensenow im back to the single use batteries as these rechargeables let me down time and again  when freshly charged they often showed voltage ratings well above v and this isnt workable in my units
so i let them run down a tad and they are usable for a blink then run down quickly under normal usealso if they are not equally discharged and charged in twos the charger will show both charged while they are not equal upon removal one battery showing a voltage rating of  and the other  fresh from the chargeri consider this to be a real problem and potentially damaging sensitive equipment if using a battery that actually has a overcharged condition
batteries rated at  volts shouldnt show over  while in service and again drain quicklyi should get  cycles from my su by nikon with a fresh battery with these its more like ishvery disappointedi cant provide a review of how these batteries perform in other equipment but if you need something that performs as rated with meaningful performance life based on my experience with this group please continue shopping for something bettersmart charger  charges unpredictablyv batteries hold unstable charges based on my experience with those shipped to mecharged life very short around  of that of a normal single use battery based on the group i receivedif you need something quick and cheap for equipment with a broad operating range then you may get something out of these
i just cant personally recommend themsorryi bought these to power my wifes first high output led flashlight
they did work but didt last nearly as long as id expected
the charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries we just werent impressedi ended up replacing each pair with a single panasonic  ma  battery and have been much happier
we ended up giving these away along with the flashlight to my stepdaughter when we upgraded the wifes flashlight to something with a little more punchthe right charge slot works fine but the left one insists on flashing indicating bad cell when ever i use it even with cells that charge fine in the right slot
since i only need to charge one cell at a time i can live with it but its peculiarworked well for my older ipods but it was purchased to enhance iphone recording
however there is no increased quality or functionality with the iphone over the built in micworks as advertised
a bit large so interferes with plugging in usb charge cord
and of course with this plugged in it turns off the speakersi have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so havent used this mic and never needed itthese work for the itouch gb but they sometimes skip when recording
you can not hear what you are recording
the sound quality is okay i did get this product fast through the mailthis microphone does what it states but nothing more
it does record sound and that can be very handy for an idevice but at the cost of the external speakers if it has one being shut off
the original reason i bought this was for the use of skype but i cant due to the speakers getting shut off
also the size can be helpful not a obstruction but it is also easily losableprosrecords soundscompactconsno speaker when in usecompactin the end buy this if you need it for the voice memos shazam an certain voice apps but with other applications such as skypethis wont do very welli bought  of these thinking they were somehow specially formatted for the s
i suppose i was naive
i could have purchased the same item for less with the special formatyes good product and works fine the phone
special
noworks great to connect my canon d or ti camera to an hd tv
i directly connected it to two of my tvs and it works perfectly
when i connected it to a  port hdmi switch it did not work
the price is greatthis was an errorhowever i shall keep it for a possible usei find that the laymans description of the plug ids are lackingalthough the name of the item is premium canon mini hdmi cable  ft its definitely not from canon
for the price i had my doubts that it ever was but it does work and still looks to be a quality cable
only  stars as the description is misleadingi bought this for my tablet ainol novo a which features mini hdmi out and the ability to play really high bitrate content and d bluray rips
i liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini hdmi end and i figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablets portcutting to the chase  id get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback
always the same scenes at the exact same time  so it wasnt a fit issue
but the scenes played perfectly when i switched back to my old adapter and cable
also  i found i wasnt able to play big  gig d rips when the other cable couldso 
for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine
i suspect this cable will be fine for the tegra  tablets original transformer galaxy tab acer iconia etc
since playback is generally limited to p
but if you play high quality video  it could be a problem  i dont know what the actual limitation isthis unit works as advertised
not the best charger i have ever used but not the worst
it allows me to keep my garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip
could be real useful if you use your gps city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot
all in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other gps accessoriesi got this charger along with a garmin nuumlvi  the charger does what it says it does and charges the gps just fine
the only problem i have isnt really with the charger but with the gps
when the charging through the usb port like this charger does
the gps stays powered on in usb connected mode the whole time
you cant turn it off and so the screen backlight and maybe the gps antenna are running while charging
thus increasing the time needed to chargegot this for my garmin nuvi
i understand the original use of card was for portable devices
nevertheless it is too small and easy to lose
now i have to lug around this slightly larger sd card to adapt it to my pc
ill probably lose it before the next time i try to update the software on the really tiny card
clunky design overalli purchased this to listen to podcasts off my blackberry curve  sprint
i have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used
generally i turn my blackberry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo
the sound quality is ok  it is a cassette after all
the cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly
i might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound qualityalso the dolby noise reduction is a must otherwise you will get a lot of hissing
i would say overall the purchase was positive perhaps my expectations were a bit too highthe product is not recommended for note book optical drives but i used it anyways and it seemed to worki tried to use it in my  ford explorer factory cd changer
no luck
it would just spit it out when it got to the brush sectioni know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers but sadly it did not work for meif anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work im all earsdid the job i needed to clean all discs components very handy and use ful to have for all cleaningthis cd lens cleaner didnt work for our broken system that could no longer read cds
but it has worked on systems in the past
simple and fast to use you just pop it into the player like a regular cd
there is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days
its a simple mechanism it has a small brushlike device that gently cleans the laser lensso look at it like this this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken cddvd playerhow can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your dvd player
i havent had any problems but im just curious if its actually cleaningi have my doubts as to whether these things do any good or not
never once have i had one clear up a burn problem
there is no substitute for opening the cabinet and blowing it out w something like a datavac see product on amazon it replaces all those cans of compressed air
one of the best investments ive ever made
i blow the dust of discs before i put them in the player
thats how most dust gets in them on the discs
 and cleaning the lens w a foam tipped swab and pure alcoholi bought these headphones at a tower records about  years ago
they are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym
today i couldnt hear anything out of the right side so ill need to toss them
i was shopping around on amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so i thought id add to it seeing that it may be a common problem with this model
i had only paid around  in the first placei did not have any problem using it but my cassette player in car is still showing clean player message
it is playing the tapes as before and i cannot tell any difference in sound quality but i should say that the quality was never that bad
i used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved
i really dont know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty or have other issuesas the author of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tent and a former radio discjockey i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the s and smaxell  audio tape head cleaner weta cassette deck can be cleaned two ways
the maxell    offers the quicker approach it will not give you the results of the more time consuming
the labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck for the units that allow this and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluidif you want faster results maxell has done almost all the work for us
the cleaner looks like a standard cassette
the instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck
presto that is itas always try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy resultsenjoy the music and be wellcraig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tentthe first of these loaded into the vcr and refused to come out
i trashed that vcr
the second one loaded into a more expensive vcr seemed to work fine  hrs but after  uses the edge was crinkled and making noise on rewind
again this my be my old vcrs that i no longer own as i switched to a magnavox mdrh dvr and no more tape plus it also burns cds or  gb hard drive
linkmagnavox mdrh gb hdd and dvdr with digital tunerbelieve it or not some of us still use vhsonly because we are digitizing them now
converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a vcr and the heads get dirty beyond recognition
eventually ill have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helpsi was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the vcr
this did nothing to help or fix the problem
years ago i used a similar product with great results for a similar problem is it because the vcr is old or this cleanerbut vcrs are getting old and so are tapes
can only remove so much
good as far as it goespros good audio easy to program good featuresconshowever the fcc will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in february   at that time the radio will no longerr receive televison broadcast audio
therefore a good percentage of the radios value is gonenationwide the fcc has reserved  weather channel frequencies available
usually all  cant be received
this radio only has  channels for weather
in my case none of those  channels contains any weather signalsedit  well it has been over  years since i purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust
radio still works though lately i need to move it around a bit for best receptionand the clock is still really hard to see
it is the volume button that is kaput
i can only get very loud and painfully loud
husband tried to fix it but couldnt do it
seven years is pretty good i guess
i dont see anything better on amazon at least for this price so i will probably purchase another of the same
something i did not mention in my original review  the batteries seem to last forever
same number of stars for the same reasonsoriginal review this shower radio is attractive compact and has great sound and station range
it is a  for the radio and a  for the clock
unfortunately the clock is very small and hard to read
i purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink but could not read the digital clock from there
if the radio is placed too high or too low the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame
there is no back light which adds to the difficulty
i had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where i stand and i still have to bend down slightly to check the time
if having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you this sony is for you
if you really need a clock in the bathroom this is not the one for youi bought these thinking they were the ticket to noisefree pleasant air travel
they fall short for two reasons
the first is that they just dont cancel that much noise
if youre not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off its just not that great  partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit
to quantify this the noise canceling sony headphones give db of noise reduction whereas the passive david clark h headphones for roughly the same price give db just because of the better seal
the second problem is that they generate noise of their own
if its not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz
so id recommend either getting a pair of earplugs or a set of headphones with a better seali have owned these for over two years and wore them about  times mostly on plane ridesi have a relatively small head so i keep them at the first expansion level
even so there is a lot of pressure
after about an hour they start to hurt my ears
i have tried to stretch them but they always return to the same size
i also put extra foam padding in the ear cups which helped a littlethey still have good sound quality and cut noise although they are not as effective as when i first bought themi tried the new bose
they fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise but of course they are much more expensiveive had my palm iiix for over a year now but im going to have to get another because i dropped it
the palm didnt fall far   feet or so  but it is now useless
white lines cover the display and the digitizer no  longer works reliably
i have tried opening up the case and reseating the  circuit boards which fixed most of the problems but the digitizer is  permanently inaccurate
even with recalibration of the digitizer using  preferences the location the palm thinks im hitting with the stylus is  wrong and this makes using the palm impossiblei bought the slimline  leather case but this clearly failed to protect the palm in any way
also  the velcro has now come unstuck so my palm wont stay in the casethis  is a real shame as my palm iiix is indispensable
i bought intellisync  software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software i have on my pc and  i use it every day to navigate my schedule
combined with the address book  for names and phone numbers i have one place to work out what im supposed  to be doing and whom im doing it withi dont use the other  applications much
i tried out the email application but it is way too  simplistic
i get over  emails a day and i really need email folders  with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume
i use eudora and  the palm email application doesnt support its folders or filtering
i  cant even convince it to just download the messages left in my  quotinquot box after all the others have been filtered outbeing  able to upgrade the operating system on the iiix turned out to be  important
version  of palmos supports infrared sync with a laptop
this is a godsend when im travelling and for syncing during long  meetings
being able to upgrade easily from palmos  made it  possiblei have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane  trips  pocketchess is my favourite
very easy to play  just drag n  drop the piecesi have looked at the handspring visor as a replacement  but lack of upgradeabile os is a key sticking point
handspring devices are  stuck at palm os  and handsprings code seems to have diverged at this  point with no hope of picking up any changes postversion  long term  this could turn into a real problem assuming palm continues to improve  palmos
the springboard expansion slot is a great idea but there are so  few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke
color cases  looked cool  until i saw them in real life vs a photo on the web
they  look kinda cheap amp nastyso ill probably buy another palm iiix
the iiie isnt expandable and i cant see how color is so useful that it  justifies the staggering price of the iiic
the palm v looks cool but im  even more worried about its fragility and the palm vii could be great if  it could actually surf the web rather than use extraordinarily limited  quotweb clippingsquoti have to say that ive grown very dependent on my iiix
id give it a score of  except for the streaking problem
mine didnt do this right away
it started hapening about  months after i began to use it
sometimes its there sometimes it isnt
when its there the streaking  looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing can make the  screen totally unreadable
five minutes later all can be fine
pda need  to be dependable
mine isnt always
before i started reading other  reviews i thought mine was just broken
i was considering buying another  but not if by luck i get another quotstreakerquot
even though i like  the iiix its reasonably priced though still expensive has great  software options id be cautious about buying another one
probably  wouldnt go with the iiix if i had known about the streaking problem in  advancethis dvd player is cheap for a reason
you get what you pay for
most of the time this player works fine
but sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen
you can sometimes just tap the machine and it  comes back on other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray  just to get rid of the blue screen
luckily this doesnt happen that often
if you dont have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player go for it but  if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the  scalenot having either a dvd or cd player i just feed discs to my imac i found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale i needed to invest in such a device
its capable of producing flawless images and soundsunless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive which happens far too often with my temperamental fastidious
machine
i would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions as this model requires extra deep shelves
finally its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with ge or other rca monitors than with  philips magnavox or sylvania monitors
it may be important to remember that  a vcr plus dvd assembly requires running the latter in quotauxilliary modequot which is hidden away somewhere in my sets menu choices and virtually inaccessible
in short the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by sony panasonic and other japanese manufacturersthis is ok if you just want a cheap portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired
many am stations that are easy to get on my other radios were nonexistent on thisbeing one of those people that likes to chase latenight am signals i was convinced that this was a radio i had to have
i was a bit disappointed in some areas but still see it as something good
this radio is big
period
once loaded with d batteries it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions
quality control seems to vary from set to set but a few things off the bat that i found were awry for my  were build quality
the switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side with the chrome finish easy to rub off dial markings
for claiming to be a dx machine both am and fm fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy
best bet is to find your local stations and remark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency rewritten by hand audio
for using a large woofertweeter and separate bass and treble controls the audio quality could be better than it is
it still sounds good but should be betteron the plus side am reception is fantastic
by turning the radio to null signals i was able to pick up a small local on  am near rochester ny then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on  am in salt lake city
the widenarrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds fm reception is quite good
picking up lowpower locals and larger  mile stations is no problem for this unit
i didnt realize there were so many fms around until i purchased this radio ac power cord
fits neatly in the back of the radio albeit a bit cramped and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signalsalthough not quite as good as its predecessor the superradioii it does what it is designed to do  allow good reception of am and fm without any bells or whistles to get in the wayif you can find it discounted then pick one up and listen away
otherwise there are better choices to be found in this price rangei bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed
it uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift
the sound was ok but a little bassy
im guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons
i ended up selling itfirst of all this is a fine radio for am radio reception but the radio that i received is bad
intermittently the volume goes down to nothingi can hear it only humminga one year warranty comes with it and i bought mine about two months ago its going back but im afraid that since the problem is intermittent it wont be fixed been there done thatnever the less its a great radio as far as receptionguess what
i bought another one today one for work one for home use im sure ill have to do without the original for a while its being repaired thoughi rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception design yet very low for quality of the build nevertheless they do have a year warranty unlike most consumer products which generally are  dayskeep the recieptnot the same as the original
fits too small so had to put tape around it to make it fiti used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that i used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls
when i got rid of that line i bought this wireless phone jack so that i could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wiresthe product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room which is in another part of the housethis unit has enabled me to use my phonefax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems
making phone calls is a different story
although there is always some noise on the line sometimes it is so minimal that i can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation
but other times the noise is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someonebottom line faxing is always possible but voice conversations sometimes are not
you need to decide what your priorities are before you buy thisthis little gizmo works fine for most phones but it does not work with phones with caller id
keep that in mind when youre considering a purchase
works great with the others
overall a nifty little deviceexcellent product while it lasts
i have yet to have one of these last for more than four months
i usually purchase a few at time so that i always have a spare for when ever it no longer works
because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have
unfortunately it does not last for too longit was difficult to set up and it does not work with the rc extension that amazon is combining with it but it does ultimately workim shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that i can pull in a few folks attending by teleconferenceim sorry but i just dont think theres any way i could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin or even a snickerthe problem to put it delicately is that the antenna is well er its um kinda well just look at it
a possible distractioni got these for christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them
i wanted to use them for my pc to play music around the house
at first i would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all
i shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my pc again with a soundblaster  sound card
excellent sound
these speakers are not for the impatient person
i do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission
the transmitter can not be surrounded by anything
i can get a good  ft out of the speakers
then i start losing signal
there are times that i get a beeping sound of them
for some reason that does subside
i do recommend them for the price
beware it might take some time to find the right niche for themliked the reception of this vs the garmin unit i had previously
but soon learned that maps are the way to go
i upgraded to a map soon after trying the i purchased the gps  in december after using another brand for five years
the gps represents a big improvement with better quicker satelite acquistion a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing
this way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing
additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two aa batteries lasting up to  hours
if weight is a concern that is big
my previous unit used four and lasted  five hours
problems the manual is as sorry as it can get
it barely  covers trackroute track history backtrack and reverse route
these are  major important features left to the user to figure out
i have yet to  figure them out consistently
with track history there seems to be an  ability to set a scale but what scale
nothing tells me
is it how often  it records a waypoint in historyi have emailed the company with  questions twice called once had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls faxed once
heard nothing from their customer  noservice
i wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts
oh yes my gps   crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old
glad i wasnt in the middle of  acres
you cant zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location
actually to do  so but you have to set a scale of  or  and pan amp scan to it
if is  is  miles away you can imagine how long that could takewhile these are ok sounding they have a feature that makes them one i use often
i bought these cheap
they offer pretty decent noise cancelling for cutting the lawn
also they come in handy for when im at workcounting beats and mixing these headphones with the noise reduction make it so much better to dial inas everyday headphones the sound and its delicate wired nature may turn some people offthey are somewhat comfortable battery life is great and comes with a carrying bad
no quarter inch adapternot too many people need it anymoreall in all a bit delicate wires can become weak at junctionsthey do what i want them to do so i buy a couple and keep a pair as backup for gigi own grado too bright beyerdynamic my favorite set and briefly had bose way too pricey and nowhere near neutral in soundif they were more durable i would rate them higherif youre careful with them and want cheap noise cancelling headphones they are worth ittheres not much choice for vhs tapes now im happy i can still find them on amazon
i would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadnt had a broken piece internally i could hear it rattling and when i took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off
but they were cheap enough that i didnt bother to return the packagevhs tapes got them for my grandma im sure they allow her to record the price is right without any troubleuse in older security systems  works fine life expectancy  used   night a week about  years getting hard to find now that everything is digitaledit some of the tapes refues to rewidn completely one after only a few days use some kind of internal binding
one screeches liek a banshee on rewind but works fine  brokeso far  of  work ok   works poorly  fights rewind  trashed in canlower review to a i gave these tapes an ok rating because they were ok for recording only one time on them but if you had to rerecord on them they were no good and unfortunately i found this out the hard way
i would only recommend  these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one timeitem is topnotch for those of us dinosaurs who still use vhs tapes i have six working in the house as well as many others in various states of disrepair plus dvd recordersplayershowever i cant say much about the packaging from amazon
the enclosure was open yes open
at two ends and no paperwork was enclosed
im hoping someone at amazon reads this and corrects their quality assurance proceduresalthough the tapes are star im giving this order a star rating because of the packagingthese headphones are a decent wirless solution but are a tale of two realitiesreality   when charged and properly tuned they sound great rich bass and full mid range with good highs
their range is excellent  i have listened to music for  hours about  feet from the base
they are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easilyreality   the challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished
the battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better
also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal
additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength if you dont have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance sufferssince i am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal but others like my wife will find it a hassleused it as directed on a polkaudio cd player and it did not improve the machine
cannot say for sure that the product didnt work or the machine is just broken
machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before
using the cleaner did not improve the machines performancethese wipes did get the job done but the fabric doesnt hold up long but for a quick cleaning its good just to have around when u are on the goi definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle
but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time toothese are ok for wrapping cables behind your desk or something like that but they do not attach to cables
if you are putting them on cables that you wrap and unwrap on a regular basis these are not so good
seemed to be designed for semi permanent installations not for daily workthese straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords  computer system cords etc
my intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel
the worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released
unfortunately  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times
not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics  but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip tiesthey were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected
honestly its easier to use a small plastic rubber band if its a cord youre going to constantly usewell they are velco so they work
they do get lost easily though kind of wish i had bought a different kindit is belkin product so it is of high qualityit does the job it was marketed fori would recommend purchasing the cable tieseasy to use i needed them to organize all the cables in my desk they work but i would rather to get the  of them in one single colorthe product works great but after doing a little more research i found that you can get  velcro cable ties for about 
with these youre basically paying for the little belkin label that is sewn on
just do an amazon search for velcro reusable selfgripping cable tiesi dont recommend this product unless you absolutely only need  of them and want a brand name sewn on
they did work great but just not worth it to me compared to other options on amazonits a cable what does one say about a product like this
i wanted one and i now have itif its wire i perfer belkin
in my opinion its a quality cord
this cord is being used on a monitor and i like the way it lays
it doesnt have a mind of its own
it stays where you put itbought it to use as an extender but it wasnt for that and even so i kept it because it will be used for somethingi needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and werent overpriced for what it is
works finefast ethernet cable built to last
bought this as an extra cable in case i needed it
works like a charm and is a great asset to have
you can never have too many cablesrj cables are so common these days youd think everything would be worked out by now apparently not sothe worst thing you can do to any electronic cable is kink it bend it sharply put a crimp in it
but my  footers shown on amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every   to   inches along the entire length and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie
each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket
cables dont like sharp bends mine have  tight bends along a  cable those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces they make a rats nest behind my comm gear and they jeopardize the integrity of the cablecmon belkin your pro series packaging is a silly gimmick because at a thrifty  per cable im betting dollars to donuts theres nothing special about your cables no rare metals no exotic coatings no braided stainless shielding its a generic ethernet cable
nothing more nothing less
kindly treat it as such
treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packagingmeanwhile my  cables from mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box in a neat  diameter coil
no kinks no sharp bends
i try to order from mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box no fancy packaging no rocket science no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks just a sound cable
unfortunately they did not have footers when i needed them
so i went with belkin after all its just a cable
next time ill wait for mediabridge to restockthese arrived in good condition
they have worked fine for my needs
its a pretty straight forward product and i think belkin does a nice job with itthis cable did what it was supposed to do and was a great price
i did recently upgrade all of my cables including this one but not for any reason in particulari have used this product on multiple devices and some of them dont seem to hold together as well as othersthis is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking
they work like they should which is good
they are a little pricey for what they are
also note that the color is not the same as in the picture
these are light gray in color not dark grayi got this cable to connect my laptop to the internet occasionally as the wifi is pretty badthe wire didnt look or feel like new and out of the boxi saw that there were bends and it felt cheapi was going to return it but it gets the job done and has no loss of speedso for the price there are not a lot of complaintsi used a pair of these speakers to set up what i called a bubba vision cheap home theater in my family room with an old sansui receiver an inexpensive dvd player and a jvc  tvthese worked very well and were a considerable improvement over the speakers in the tv
however it wasnt soon before i felt rather dissatisfied with them
not unhappy but just aware that i was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers so i resold themhowever i also own a pair of the audiosource ls speakers
they cost even less than these speakers and to me have a bigger and warmer sound
im still using those and plan to be for quite some timefor the price and the brand name motorolas frs radios should be more durable  these dont last long in average use either business use by it professionals or the real torture test with preteen boysi have used this case for almost  months and still having difficulties when trying to put it in my shirt pocketforget about putting some credit cards in it because it gets thickeri gives a lot of protection for the palm but it affects the best characteristic sizei have been alternating this case with the original cover depending the ocassion and the clothes im going to wear in order to carry it in a comfortable and practical waythe quality of the product is excellent except that it serves as a big impediment for when you charge on the palm cradlethis wont fit inside the palm cradlewas sort of perfect for my needs  using an obsolete storage system to take obsolete writing files from an older mac and copy them to an emac
i then had to convert to a current word processing software opensourceorg and then my intent was to plug this zip drive into my imac and copy all those newly translated files to the imac
but for some reason my imac couldnt see or read the iomega zip drive it saw it at the usb hub
so i had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the emac
then i was able to copy to the imac from the flash drive
their customer support said the drive had been tested through mac os  and it worked fine have  mountain lion
in a round about way the technology served its purpose
thank goodness
the seller was quick in responding to my questions
good customer serviceas it makes little sense for the mb to be the original zip you put on a  new system anymore most people who buy this product will probably be  upgrading from an old parallel version
to be sure it is an improvement  on that device
its noticeably faster
but its smart for only a couple  of  very specific kinds of userthe first is the backup bandit
if  you only use your zip drive for routine automated backup of files that fit  easily onto a single mb disk its unlikely you need much more than this  devicethe second is the ivehadazipforyears geek
if you have  a huge library of zip  disks already amassed and the average file size  is above mb then theres an argument to be made for staying with this  product
notice that im talking here about a library of truly big files  typically graphics
if all you have is a massive library of text  documents you shouldnt fear switching over to the zip  at allin  my opinion anyone else should go for the usb version of the zip  and  add on a firewire adapter when it becomes availablewhywell  the zip  usb with firewire is simply the most flexible zip out there
you can use it on literally any system that has at least usb ports can  achieve the lightning speeds of internal scsi zips if the computer has  firewire portsand you dont have to sacrifice a scrap of portability
while the zip  here can be fitted out with a firewire adapter it cant  use zip  disks
true the zip  is mysteriously slower than a zip   if the files are something above mb
but youll never notice the  difference with the vast majority of files
what you will notice if you  spend any time seriously archiving your work is how nice it would be to  have a little bit more room on a mb disk
the zip  solves that  problem by giving you a lot more room to play in
in particular the s  are obviously bettersuited to sharing larger multimedia files between  computers or even between platforms
finally the  simply looks  cooler
those looks even translate into utility because its trim profile  really does make it a little easier to carryin fairness i should point  out that the mb appears to have a substantially lower price tag
but  its not really
you pay on average  times as much for zip  disks  per megabyte of storage space than for zip s
long term your storage  savings with a zip  more than make up for the upfront difference  between the two modelslooks nice
only complaint is if moderately packed it is hard to close
good for the light travelerfor users that travels a lot  recomended most cases when you need leave your notebook in some conference room or room hotelafter recently purchasing a new palm vx i thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap
the palm v hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the momentthe case attaches to the palm v via the left stylus storage area
a stylus shaped piece attaches the palm to the hinge in the case
the case itself opens like a book and allows the palm to move much like a page in the book
located behind the palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper
the case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the ir port as well as the right styluspros protects as advertised
the point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all and this case delivers as advertised
the aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the palm v tightly and securely allows for ir port usage while resting in case case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketcons heavy one of the selling points for the palm v series is the sleek lightweight design
while this case may not seem like too much additional weight the combination of the palm v in the case is noticeably heavier
in fact my wifes palm iii and my palm v weigh about the same now obstructive hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself
a friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well hand holding the unit is more difficult
with the included leather flap you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the palm in one hand
the hard case does not fold back on itself which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the palm
this is especially annoying for me since i use my palm frequently while standing or walking here and there overall i think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her palm in the smallest package
you will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers
at this time i am still using the case but i anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when i grow tired of the cons listed abovethanks for your timewhen i saw pictures of this i expected this to be a substantial case
since its called a hard case i expected it well to be hard
but its not
its plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton
the metal sides will give if you try to bend it
also i think the closing mechanism is terrible
you have to get the palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then its not a tight seal
and usually when its put in this way the top of the case will hit the contrast button and youll have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen
it does not snap together which annoys me
while the case itself may not stay shut the palm is securely held in the case which is one good thing about this case
it has a holder similair to the stylus so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots
i prefer this way of attaching the palm rather than some other cases which use velcro
im not going to trust velcro with something that is as expensive as a palmi totally dont think its worth the money but at the same time having good protection for your palm is an absolute necessity so i actually do recommend that you get this product
my palm has taken several tumbles and its no worse for the wear
ive had my palm and case for about two weeks now and theres already quite a few scratches on the metal casing
so it does protect it
but if you are expecting this case to be really nicely made and substantial guess again
it will however offer some protection to your pdai think palm could and should be making a better product
our palms cost us a bundle and we want to protect them
its almost like the people at palm want our pdas to break so they can sell us more
i dont see why theres so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible
id rather see a slightly bulkier yet streamlined case that not only securely held the palm but had about a quarter inch of foam padding on the inside to protect the unit from damage and then a true metal casing on the outside
even with some extra padding and bulk the case would still be tinybought these batteries to use with the kodak battery charger which ships with  aa batteries
plan was to use them for my digital camerathey work but unlike the batteries that ship with the kodak which are   mahrated these batteries are rated at only  mah
mah means  milliamp hours and is a measure of the amount of power the battery can  store and deliver before needing to be rechargedso they deliver only   of the life of the higherrated batteries
my digital cam responds to  this with a halfbattery indicator even when all  batteries are at full  chargei have been using this for a while to secure a monitor and two external hard drives
one of the hard drives died and i wanted to secure its replacement so ordered another set
while waiting i wondered if i could get the plastic anchor off and reuse it
i set it on a table placed a putty knife at the joint and with one feeble blow popped it off
now i dont feel as secure
the epoxy that came with the set worked fine but didnt bond to the hard drives plastic case as strongly as i would have expectedwell since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device i wont delve too deeply into those aspects
however very rarely did i see any mention of how cheap of a device this is the plastic feels of very low grade the reset button litterally rattles its so loose
overall yes the device works so i wont knock it for that unfortunately i have no means of testing the actual surgeprotection but i just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case buildpros of the devicesmart circle design obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking upblocking outlets
for that it works greatcute design it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets however the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are and looks less cute in personlong cord ft is pretty long so make sure you need that long of a cord since the average cord length is around ft for a surge protector
still for my application a long cord is a plus since i needed at least a ft cordconsreally bad build quality again just super cheap plastic and the reset button is really wobbly barely feels like its held on
the cord seems of decent gaugeinsulation at least and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exteriorno swivel outlet for the cost of this device it really should come with a swivel outlet connection so if your outlet is upsidedown connected to a light switch or you need it to go to the right of the socket the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction
i have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet but on something that costs almost  it really should have included itsummarylook if were rating the device on whether it provides power or not of course it works and should get  stars
the circle design is also very nice and again worthy of some stars
but with how poor the build quality is on this and this was ordered from amazon directly not rd party and the fact that they didnt even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for i cant give this a fantastic rating but will still give it an ok rating as it does in fact work but that alone doesnt deserve  stars
i purchased the device on a cybermonday sale and even at the significantlyreducted price im still debating on if i should keep it or not
i have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands and as such im somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap
id say for a sale price it might be worth it or if youre really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it although i have several longercord protectors that didnt cost near this much but ive purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on salea pretty good device overall but one thing really bugs me
i have it in a leather case
i was carrying it in my hand one day and i dropped it
only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather
that incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop
in order to activiate something i have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen
the functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range and the writing area shifted down  also
i cant tell if its because the writing area shifted downwards but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too
i cant say  anything else bad about it but what a letdown to know that it cant take  simple impactsi finally decided to spend the extra  for the palm v and give my old palm iii to my dad
afterall i loved the styling but more importantly wanted the slimmer sizeunfortunately when you use the hard cover that comes with the palm v and put it in your pocket it causes the power button  to turn on and then the updown key constantly clicks
huhso then i  went out and got the hard case a rip off if you ask me causing the  palm v to be just as thick as my palm iii
that left me wondering why i  bothered spending all that extra money to get a palm no smaller than the  one i already haddad can i get my palm iii backthis christmas i decided to treat myself to a palm computer
after reading the specs on the palm v and the palm iiie i decided to buy the palm iiie
it seems that the only differences are about  the palm v has flash ram  making it upgradeable the cool look of heat blasted anodized aluminum
i  got a soft fullgrain black leather case which makes the palm iiie look as  cool as the palm v i feel that the palm iiie is more portable because you  can get aaa batteries anywhere and do not have to rely on the cradle   charger
the funny thing is that im still using my casio sfer digital  diary with  kb memory for my electronic organizing needsi owned a palm iii for a while when it came out and then stepped up to the v after about a year with my iii
what can i say
i was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeali have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs
i have used every part of the palm  software suite except the expense reporting featurewhile i like the  palm vs style i have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issuesfeatures lacks decent sound for starters a beep is  boring and weak
when i carry the palm in its home my pocket i cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed
the screen is a mixed bag
while its clarity is better than other organizers it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired
battery power is okay but not anywhere near the advertised time of   daysmemory is a whole different issue
all i have on my palm is some   addresses and  calendar entries and it tells me i am half full as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity
i don use but a couple of  aftermarket programsthe graffiti recognizer is crap
when it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen
real users need to get jot
from  cicpalm incs tech support is the worst
most of their support staff  can hardly speak english so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue
whats more they dont even care
i was pormised a return  call  had to call back
i have not once ever received a real response by  email  only autoresponders that say quot hoursquot  still  waiting on my inquiry from januaryin short save a little longer and  get the cassiopeia e when it comes out
in my experiences with  headtohead comparrisons of cassiopeia es to my palm v the cassio was  a true frontrunner
the e will certainly be even better
if you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and dont need sound  memory genuine word processing or spreadsheet or color screen then go  with the palm v
but if you need features and real performance get a  windows ce devicei needed to read the description better
however i feel i need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper not really cardboard or glossy
and the printing comes out rather flat
of course i have used memorex before but have always used glossy before so they make great products but this one is pretty much of no use to me
but its mainly my fault for not reading more carefullythese days people seem to have forgotten what jewel cases are but these inserts are a definite step up from the scissors and printer paper method
they dont look especially good or fit better than adequately but they are better thansee abovememorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons
first because its easy to use
cover art from cds that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the memorex website and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your cd collection
where it gets tricky  if darn near impossible  is creating the rear front insert printing
but if youre looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the productthe instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or retailpresentable is very spare if not available at all
part of the reason for this is that  of all retail cd cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product
the maxell product however is on matte paper
this requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for say a matte greeting card
if you use the incorrect setting you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a wavy effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin
so do a few test runs before you make a final copy  or at least expect youll use  to get used to the product if its the first time youre making cover artthe format of the preprinted and preperforated sheet is excellent however
but there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art
as the manufacturer indicates you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the  x  sheet
you wont get the seamless cut you get say from avery business card stock of the premium variety but youll get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rulealso be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are
i did this on the first sheet and had to repeatthe software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself  but as with anything on a printer make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you dont have any overlap
my advice is to slightly oversize the original art easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top bottom or either side
it takes some tweaking  its not as simple as just dragging dropping and printingall that said this product is more than adequate  software and inserts  for making gift mix cds
the intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds and placing track lists on your inserts
in fact the software is so useful i am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stockin short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of valuepriced cds to be sold at retail or to give a faceless cd a new jewel case home for your personal collection
but if youre looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art then look elsewhere
alternatively if you are making your own cds to be jewel cased as gifts or to create dvd rom cover art for custom projects  business or personal  this would be an excellent product
for example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product
since i have almost one hundred of these sheets ill work my way through them
but because i have customers who demand nearretailnew perfection in their purchases i am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aestheticon value and price this is an excellent product  certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where i had seen them locally
and again if youre using these for personal data storage homemade products or whatnot these are excellent
that said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product that if printed on a low dpi printer can appear even  dare i say  kitschybut with amazon prime offers and excellent delivery im not throwing stones at retailers  just letting consumers know that if youre looking for what i was looking for  replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels youll need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fiti got these to label  dvds that i was mailing out for a fundraiser convention
creating the design wasnt too horribly difficult
but after printing it took a few minutes each label to tear out and put together into a cd case
i wasnt expecting the puzzle there are several different tearlines you end up with more ripped off bits and pieces then actual pieces for the case
then getting it to go together in the case was like a game
if i had just been making a personal coverlabel for my own dvd it wouldnt have seemed like such a hassle
but making  i had to do it over the course of  days
it was quite tiringi guess for the price i paid they at least got the job done
but dont expect an easy process is all im saying
i felt like i signed up for something i hadnt quite bargained for course ive also never assembled my own cd cover before so it could very well be like this with all of themokthe fellow that reviewed several before me made a good point
you dont want to use this in an enterprise environmentduh
im an mcse and i wouldnt recommend this card to any company but for the home there is  absolutely nothing wrong with this card
it works and you can get  or   at the price of one of those big dog names
do those work  times  better
no they dont
i have  pcs of my own at home altogether in  there and all have different nic cards
netgear performs just as well as  the others and i wouldnt complain if i had one of their cards in every one  of those machinesso in short setting up a corporate lanwan
then  dont pick up one of these cards
got a couple of computers or just one  and want to play network games with friendssave a few bucks and go buy  one of these and use what you saved on something elsei bought this for a kodak dc and it was ok to use
i guess that i realized ithat i wanted a larger style bag though this one worked if i just wanted to bring along the camera and an extra memory card
i was never thrilled with it and then i purchased a new camera canon g that did not fit in this case
that was when i realized how good life could be with a larger bagif you want a small case to just carry your camera and a few very small accessories  aa batteris and a memory card or two then this might be the one for you
but it wasnt the right one for mei have owned one of these upss for about  years
earlier this year the alarms went off indicating that the battery needed replacement
i thought that was odd considering the age of the unit
no problem though  ill just log onto apcs website and order a replacement battery
wasnt i surprised to see that apc indicates that this model doesnt have a replacable battery
this didnt make much sense to me since the unit has an access door to the battery compartmentwell  i removed the battery and found a web vendor that had a replacement for 
it is a very common volt cell and was available from several vendors
the unit is back up and working well againi have experienced several blackouts in the past few years and this ups can keep my cpu  monitor cable modem  network switch operable for enough time to save any work in progress and shut down my systemin closing it is a well designed unit with adequate power for most home or small office systems
but i was a little put off by the short life of the original battery and incorrect replacement information listed by apcessentially this is the entrylevel bit audio creative labs sound  card
it has a builtin mock d stereo effect a voice midi  wavetable and it can sample at up to khz in bit stereo and thats  about all there is to it
whilst it doesnt do anything wrong in itself  its plugandplay so if youre using windows it should work out of the  box the soundblaster live isnt much more expensive and offers  environmental audioif you only dabble with music and dont play many  new games its a perfectly adequate solution howeverthis is a basic lowend sound card
it puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer
it comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cdrom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cdrom
the drivers are included for all windows including xpwhy you wouldnt want this cardif you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp over  bitrate  or less will sound fine with this cardi dont understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windowsthese binoculars are super nice
they really get you close to the action and the d effect is terrific
detail and sharpness are very good as wellif you wear glasses youre better off removing them
if you leave your glasses on it just doesnt work very well
on the other hand you are allowed to adjust each  eyepiece separate if youre like me and dont see 
however there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece
so you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars then cover the left side to finetune the focus for your right eye
i found it a bit counterintuitive and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side
even so once you have it dialed in there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertentlymy biggest issue with these binoculars is that they wont focus in close enough
the target has to be close to  away
since theyre highpowered binoculars thats probably ok for most uses
but i spend a lot of time watching birds  from my window
now im going to have to buy another pair for that purposetheyre also heavy
expect to put them down often to rest
thats probably normal for binoculars this powerful
when my wife first used them she was shocked at how large faraway objects werethey work and for the price i cant complain to much
the construction of the unit is almost all plastic and the ocular bridge flexes when you put any pressure on it
though its nice to have a set of binos that dont break the bank if one of the young ones dropsdamagesloses them
at x they can be little shaky off hand but i use this set primarily for spotting during rim fire shooting games and these binoculars make seeing lr bullet holes at yds very easy to see and scorei gave it only  stars because the focus is just a marketing gimmick that creates a cheap focusing mechanism
a decent traditional wheel for focusing is superior
you cant easily get a good focus pressing your eyes against the eyepiece can force them out of focus and its easy to bump the rocker bar
at x power you have to carefully adjust focus and a rocker bar is an awful design
you have to use both hands to focus you can press down on one side of the rocker bar but not up so to go in and out of focus to get good sharpness you have to press down with one hands finger and then press down with the other hands finger
the rocker bar is terrible idea especially for x
to make matters worse there is a fair amount of play in the rocker bar
the rocker bar seems to be the limiting factor on short distances
 feet seemed to be the shortest distance they would focus
stars come into focus well before the limit of the longdistance focus is reached possibly indicating questionable workmanship or maybe it makes it better for those who are reallybad nearsightedthe moons of jupiter were clear and sharp even under city lights
since it was the brightest star in the sky i thuoght i was looking at venus but when i saw the  sharp dots surrounding the round disk i knew it had to be jupiter
you have to rest them on a chair to see the moonsthe price here at amazon with free shipping is  less than my local walmart after our  taxesx requires a fence or car or window to provide the stability needed to make full use of x
even without a prop its good but if your not going to use a prop x is better because the amount of light is greater and the field of view is largerthese are decent binoculars
they are rubber armored and seem fairly sturdy
i live on the th floor near the beach
these are great for watching moving boats and jetskis go by through my living room window
they are good for a quick look at something but difficult to hold steady for more than  seconds
i guess thats the same for all x binoculars
they work better with a tripod mount and a tripod
these are probably easier to hold steady than xs
the zip focus is handy
the focus at x magnification is more critical than x or x binoculars
i find myself refocusing very frequently
kind of a pain after using my other bushnell x permafocus binoculars which never need to be refocused
i got these for stargazing
they dont work as well as expected for that purpose
first the bak prisms dont transmit light as well as bak prisms
second the mm objective lens is not large enough for x magnification at night
i also own a pair of pentax whitetails xs which are much better for stargazing
the whitetails are much easier to hold steady and the image is much brighter at night
the whitetails are slightly heavier though
the celestron xs are probably a better choice for stargazing if you want high magnification
i thought about returning the bushnell xs because they arent so good at night
i gave them a second chance today and decided to keep them for daytime use
not bad as a spare pair to have around with higher magnification than x or x but i dont recommend them as your first or only pair of binoculars thoughas for magnification x and x binos are fairly easy to hold steady
x approaches the limit of steadyness for handheld use
i used to have a pair of tasco xs and tried to use them for stargazing
i had to prop my elbows on a car hood to use them
even then they were not very steady
i loaned them to a friend for a football game once and i never saw them again
no great loss really
x is really pushing the limit for shakeyness
theres no way id buy x binoculars for handheld use
x seems to be the best compromise between steadyness and magnification
for stargazing many authors recommend x binoculars
personally i dont think x magnification is good enough
youll want something with higher magnification after trying them
you cant really go wrong with a pair of xs for stargazing like the pentax whitetails i mentioned before
the xs might even be cheaper for the same optical quality as xs
a pair of xs or xs would be good for stargazing too but the xs are more bang for the buck
if youve never owned a pair of binoculars before and you want some good ones for daytime use you cant really go wrong with a good pair of xs
i like the xs better than xs because x is not high enough magnification
the price difference between x and x isnt that muchthe pair of x bushnell powerview binoculars i received were defective from the start with serious double vision and unequal focus between eyes despite diopter adjustment so i cant comment on their optic quality
i did test each barrel separately and thought the x view was big bright and clear
although it seemed neither side focused real shapely that may have been from the defects my pair came withcurrently  the listing for these x porroprism binoculars says roof prism for some reason 
i tested my xs on a sunny day
tho theyre high power  for the objective lens diameter  the exit pupil size gave me no trouble
it may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view at least on a bright daythere are complaints in the reviews about the lever focus mechanism versus a focus wheel
the little that i used the binoculars i didnt have a problem with the lever focus
in fact focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice
the lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether bushnell executed it effectively is in question
and i suppose its possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent softfocus but given my pairs other huge problems it was impossible to tellthe reviews complaining of the toowide interpupillary adjustment are spoton
im male of average height
my eyes arent particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me
ive never before had that trouble with binoculars
these binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of peopleotherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durablemy main problem wasnt with the binoculars but with amazon warehouse deals where i bought them
theres no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to meits plain bad business and bad customer service
anyone considering buying binoculars from warehouse deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons
luckily theyre pretty easy about returns and letting you try again
a keeper arrives eventuallyof course ill return them
im ambivalent about trying another pair of x powerviews
the complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with
then i get this pair thats so miserably outofwhack
it might be a fluke or it might be the powerview design 
if youre looking at powerviews consider bushnell ho i have a pair of x hos
for about the same price the hos are waterproof  more solid and come with a wheel focus and better twistup rather than foldup eyecups
however hos dont have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectivesi do not know if my experience was the same for those that had an awfull time installing this modem
but after force install i was online all in all about  minutes sure that should not be the case especially now days coming from a well known brand such as this was install should have been  minutesfirst out of the box the install disk failed error something about corrupt or missing driver that seemd ok the instructions warned of a possible system patched needed ok so did the patch same error
missing or corrupt file hmmm i wonder how many bad install disks are floating arouund aggrevating peoplethis is really a great stable fast modem feel bad for those that gave up on the install
anyways first i had to figure out what driver on the disk belongs with my modem after a few trial and error and educated guess i identifieds the installation driver directly on the disk and manually loaded the driversbut thats not the end of this story
for some reason the pci card barely fit into the case the aligment was off and could barely fit
i did manage to get everything seated but it was difficult the plate needs to come in a th of and inch perhaps even a quartermy install was in a dell dimension tower winse the old usrobotics finnaly caved in after years of slowly dyingmodem connect fast and realatively seems to work pretty fast as far as browsing web pages almost comparable to low speed dsl really seems that good
connection consistantly made at k which is very exceptable the old usr when new pegged k alot and i was impressed but eventually that card died after  years i have an old mot k about  years and still runs very well stars aggrevating installation bad disk etc and bad manufacturing the alignment was difficult to seat properly very tight fit
after those hurdles runs very wellno matter what make sure you get the modem that is harware based not software driven
there are two version of the diamond supramax modem make sure it is the correct one
look for the pro model it has the on board dsp chip hardware basedif having difficulty install the supramax pro version look for the pciproa on the disk
otherwise for the nonpro version use the multiple install disk folders that are next to the proathis rio model is a nifty music device
compact size fantastic sound quality no skipping and easy transfer of music from a computer
on the other hand it only holds six or seven songs the door on the battery case  doesnt stay shut so well after a few months of use and a little abuse  and the quotholdquot switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move
if you can find it on the cheap its a cool toy  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunesi have this unit with the  meg flash card
when i first bought the product i was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs
after the honeymoon was  over i started to have issues
the software that came with it was the  music match softwareit was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiryi called diamond and they told me their rio port software was to  come out shortly
when the software did come out i found it didnt work  properly on the pmp
i looked for some help files on quotconfiguration   troubleshooting quot but there was none
tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp doesnt always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software
 reinstalls later i still couldnt get the rio  port software to work so i gave up and i just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks
since then my lcd has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke
the unit is about a year old now and  cost about   newi really like my mp player but i will not buy  another rio i am looking at alternativesgot this for our student to practice whiteout any hasslesdecent material at the right price and it works
thank you yamaha and amazon
 but im still unhappy about needing to buy a power cordthis mic is very popular around gamers espicially if you want to fragtalitys mic mod
this mic used to cost around  dollars
its a great mic but why is there a need to increase the price ten fold
i would just go with a zalman clipon
if you have  to spend on a mic after  on a headset and  on a mixamp go right ahead but that is something that i will not be doingi got these because of the price and they not to bad a headset
they are very light and stay in place on your head
the mouth mic foam come off very easy but they work like they shouldi bought these earbuds specifically for my helmet and ease of use
as it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting
not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles
the boom mics sold by motorola are perfect for thisstatic communications this set up is fine hiking skiing something like that
for the purpose that i purchased them for awfuloverall product though goodi found that the ear bud was very large for my ear and it kept falling out even though it was under my pull over hat
it works fine and the push to talk button by the mic bud is a nice featureexcellent motorola quality and when paired with the tas excellent volume levels plus control it allows you to use it even in crowded noisy environments
the ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the talk abouts but there is room for improvement
my biggest complaint is that the ta dont allow for the alert tone call tones  menu tones  etc
volumes to be regulated
this makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum
the ta do allow the alert tones to be disabled but that makes it a little more difficult to operate especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing
my only other complaint was in the design of the pttmic housing
i wouldve preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on the ptt button is quot from the mic and pressing it with gloves on covers the mic
in closing the alert tone volume issue is a ta one not this units and id buy this again if i were to lose this one but i sure wish theyd improve on itworked but not well made and i have stopped using them and bought a better quality earpiece they did however workworks good but im worried for how long
the wire is thin and im always worried its going to break at the many connection points
works with the motorola two way radiosbought it for skiing and although its convenient its hard to understand people on it
i think itay just be the cold temperature but its been pretty awful about every time ive skied
i used it on a warm day to test it and it seemed fine though
guess it just isnt great for what i had in mind 
the cord is also very shortit works very well with all the talkabout radios i have
only drawback is the clip started to break after  days of daily use in the florida parks
when the clip breaks it gets annoying having to carry it in your handhello radio lovers
i have  a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience  i can do accurate compares which many find helpful
when i purchased this radio i so wanted it to be great like the old days of grundig 
its not bad  but i wouldnt go out of my way to reccommend it over others 
the sony swgr and the sangean ats are much better buys 
heres why  first off the grundig ybpe is generally not made very well 
the poor quality of the body  the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen 
the tuner sensativity on fm is good but am and sw are fair 
the side band set up is ok  others are better 
one draw back is that it takes  aa batteries while the others take  this makes the radio very heavy for its size 
true that the sangean  and the sony  are a little more expensive but worth it 
you are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound 
so i guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so goodnow ill admit i didnt strip it down and count how many twists per foot but this blue three foot belkin cat cable is just about all you can expect from a functional blue ft piece of cat with molded plugs
yup shore isthis cable was very well described came on time and i was very pleased with it would recommend it to anyonewith a box of over  cat  cables i have no idea why i bought this i must have been drunk
also claiming a foot cord as snagless is a bit overboard but those marketing execs really know what they are doing at belkinits an ethernet cable
seems to work fine
have had no issues and passes the signal like it needs towhat can i really say
its a standard cat cable
it seems to be well constructed and it works
there is nothing more to sayplugs are not plated full plastic which can causes mass problemsthey do their job as expected for the restworks fine
no problems with any of the connectors
packaging was fine when i received it
overall no problems and works to standardi use this to have an extra monitor closer to my ham shack
it does the job but the screws dont reach the nuts so i only could plug the cord in and could not screw it in placeas expected with any ccd mine got a hospot burned into the image where the sun hit the camera at the same point every afternoon i have it watching my front pasture
i have since adjusted the positionalso a lot of the software included is actually demo versions and if you want to use them for more than just play you either have to go buy the full version or hack around your setup to work aroung the limits of the demo version this seems to be a common but still misleading way all the cam manufactures bundle the software with their webcamsgreat camera
but it is made for widows  windows  and windows  the furnished drivers are for those systems only and will not work with later operating systems
also i cannot locate any vista or win drivers for the camera
too bad the mac does not even recognize that the camera is connectedpalm comes with a stylus
if you lose it then buy this otherwise its a waste
and by the way if you have long fingernails you can use that to input into your palm when youre too lazy to take the stylus outi bought these babies the same day that i bought my vx
i thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are
considering my penchant for misplacing things particularly pens i thought i should go ahead and get them
for some strange reason ive only lost one in  months and that was the one that came with the unit
in that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a whilehowever if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way
the replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one
it doesnt fit right
after a little investigation i found that the plastic tip the part that can unscrew is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus
thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back
why this is i have no clue but its really annoyingfor anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silopersonally though i dont use the stylus
i recommend you go get one of those multipens that have a stylus pen and pencil all in one
all serious palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps at the very least
its like writing with a toothpick
if you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen
cross makes a good one lamy and rotring also makes excellent multipens
personally i use a rotring black matte triopen
it carries a blue pen stylus and pencil
its a great size weight and looks incredibly coolagain if you anticipate scribling alot on your palm i strongly recommend getting a multipen
however if you dont think you will be the stock stylus will sufficethis styluss tip seems to be of a harder plastic than that of the palm iiis the one with a silver metal body and grey plastic ends
having just switched from iii to v the difference was dramatic
i have spares of the  iii type at my desk  its quicker to just grab that than pull the palms  one out and i wont forget to put it backim afraid of wearing down  my palms sensor surface so am shopping for a quotsofterquot stylus  for the v  the vs are a touch slimmer so my spare stylii wont fit its  holderthe dazzle multimedia dm digital video creator is very useful to import video from your tv vcr or dvd player into your pc for editing and then converting to pc video formats
the device is exceptionally good for  making videos for use on the web or as email attachments
thanks to its  use of usb its very simple to install and can be quothotswapedquot  with other usb device without rebooting your computeri dont recommend  using the device if you plan on editing videos on your computer and want to  export it to video tape
if you will be using the device primarily for  making videos for web broadcasting there is an internet version available  that is optimized for this task
the internet version also includes a  realvideo converter and encoderthe included software package is very  useful and stable
however the included ulead video studio and ulead photo  express are not the most current versionthis is a very good product
it still take a charge
very good echarable battery
my husband uses it for his recording mixer
good to have for outdoors usethe only reason that i use this charger is in case i have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful maha mhcd charger
unfortunately the maha mhcd needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge so that is why i sometimes need to use this energizer chmfc for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the maha mhcd to initiate a charge
the energizer chmfc does not care how dead a battery is but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my maha which uses pulsed charging
the maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries
at least the energizer chmfc does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening  minute chargers howeverthis is a versatile charger that charges all standard size nimh and nicads and reliably
i have used it for a year with no problems a good value for the pricesmarter chargers have been recommended hereat about three times the price to compensate for some of the issues with notsosmart but less expensive chargers like this one
i must admit the information provided by energizer with this charger doesnt help to understand the limitation of this fixed time chargerit will put milliamps for  hours into a aa nimh
ma times  hours  mah
it uses ma in its nicad setting for  hours  mah for aas
since there is always some existing charge left in rechargeables before recharging if your nimh aas capacity is less than mahtypically yes for aa nimh they will be fully charged by this charger
likewise nicad aas less than about mahtypical for nicads your batteries will be fully chargedyou can use the information above and the charging currents given on the spec sheet for this charger to figure charging capacities for other size and capacity batteries
c and d size capacities greater than mah will not be fully charged in one  hour cycle and will have to be cycled twice x mah  mahor more times unless left in the charger to trickle charge for a long period of timea good idea in any case to top off all charges
every  hours of ma trickle current will add another mah charge to a c or d cell till it reaches its full rated mah capacity
trickle charging batteries by leaving them in the charger after the timed charge cycle  hours on nimh setting  hours on nicad will keep your batteries topped off to full capacity at all times without hurting themso this charger is a good value if you understand what it does and and does not do
those with less knowledge or time but more money may want to buy the more expensive smart chargers others have mentioned here
the vanson would be my choice a very good value
i have derated this charger because of lack of information provided to the consumer by energizer on its site and on its spec sheet for this charger
theyre not alone in this department but there is still no excuse for thisif you really dont need a universalall battery types charged then you can get a smart aaaaa combination charger for much less
i would recommend the ripvan lighting n at ripvancom
it charges fast but gentlydoesnt overheat batteries a life killerhope this has helped everyone
rechargeables are the only way to go for saving you gobs of money and the environment gobs of abuse
buy good high capacity rechargeables like highly rated energizers and buy a good charger that will treat them right for you
noooooo overheating by cheap quick chargersperhaps the only bummer with the palm v series is that they have a slow serial port connection which takes much longer to sync than a usb port
id recommend buying the usb palmconnect kit instead which costs about the same
shop aroundthe item pricing was good however i did not get to enjoy their uses because i could not get my palm pilot completely operationalsomething had expiredi agree with others here
all the components of this kit work very well
i took my palm vx to italy and had no trouble keeping it charged thanks to the adapters
i felt safe doing it with the converter too
i know people who have damaged computer equipment by trying to make do with cheap adaptersthe sync cord is great
i use it at work instead of buying another cradle
it would be nice if they sold this separatelyin the end my only problem with this kit is the price
its a bit much for what you get
i suppose if you travel overseas a lot itll pay for itself eventually
occaisional travellers will just have to swallow the costdo i hear any third party vendors out there
ps this would get  stars if it were cheaper and  stars if you could use the adapter plugs with other things theyre made to be used only with this converterfor a slightly less price you can get yourself a negative pulse charger
a negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteriestake a look at the maha c charger or radio shack cat  pulse charger
theyre microprocessor controlled so that you cant overcharge your batteries
with the c you can charge any type of battery ranging from v to vthis is indeed a lightweight tripod as advertised
i didnt expect manfrotto carbonfiber quality but the head is a bit disappointing
the quickrelease plate is somewhat fussy to get onto a camera and into the headif youre going to mount a still camera and leave it stationary indoors this unit should work passably but beware if youre going to use it with a video camera  mine doesnt pan smoothly and wobbles quite a bit when using any controls on my canon hg or the rode svm mounted on top or when people walk around nearby
this leads to shaky video even with incamera is which in turn works against the compressibility of the resultant files
the tilt hinge is something of a disappointment as with a still camera in landscape orientation when fully closed the camera is slightly tiltedif ones needs are very occasional and dont require panning or much adjustment this could be a reasonable buy
its probably also fine for holding reflectors mic booms or lights
i think though for video use im going to invest in a slik or other unit around the  rangethis tripod is too short i virtually always use it extended to full height including the head too flimsy it struggles to hold my canon d still even with a small lens and difficult to adjust the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle
the removable head is also a bit flimsy
however its also light and ridiculously cheap
dont pay more than  for it and you wont be disappointedas others have mentioned only works with  disks
out of curiosity did try a single sided  and double sided  but no luck
works ok  build feels a little cheap dive itself is pretty noisy
i ended up returning  simply using an old computer to read floppies
if this is your only option worth giving it a trythe unit works flawlessly
unfortunately many software applications that still require floppy disks dont recognize usb floppy drives
my app is one of those
i have a partial workaround
i run the software as administrator and despite receiving an error message that no floppy drive exists the drive starts working
go figure
the  stars represents a warning to the buyer to make sure that their applications recognize usb floppy driversthis same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names
obviously not very high quality but i need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine  this seems to be the only optioni bought   works for now and the other just wanted to reformat all the time whether there was a disk in it or not
i guess ill order a couple more for sparesi guess it is hard to complain about any fdd device anymore as manufacturers discontinue the production of  floppy disks
this served a purpose but in the end run is just a desperate attempt to read all old floppies and move their info off to cdrs for more permanent storage until the begin to disappear as wellusing this with os x is a real pain using it with parallels  on os x to recover or produce temporary fdds for win or msdos apps is useless
win machine is the next trial but on the front this will always be a frivolous spend and a somewhat frivolous attempt to resurrect aging and probably bad fdscompany replaced the item
so i raised the rating to  stars
it makes keeping track of the cac convenient
the company makes one that is better constucted
recommend buying that oneit works and it doesnt
the product itself works and yes it works with the operating systems but it didnt work for my needs
i had old floppies from and xp machine and wanted to get data back
with this i kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which i knew not to be the case yes im aware of degradation of floppy drives over time
i did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesnt recognize some of the older floppy disksi managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks
all but  of the disks resulted in data retrieval
so while this actually works drivers install shows up as a valid drive etc
it really doesnt
most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didnt do for mei thought for the price it would be a complete kit
its oem
its just a bare drive no cable no driver manual  nothing
if you know what youre doing or are replacing an old floppy itll do but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere
they should put that its oem in the descriptioni like this product
just know that if you have labels on the floppy disk more than one the disk will get stuck on ejection
the tolerance is too tight in that regardit doesnt work with dd disks only hd disks
we had a few of the former and we had to decide to just give up on themit mounted fine on a macbook and even transferred our old system  mac diskswe did get a defective one first but amazon replaced it quickly enoughi plugged the drive in and my win  pc indicated it was downloaded a driver
after that i could read and writes files just fine
it does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them
ive had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezersworked out of the box with my macbook prodoes not eject with computer command must manual ejectnoisy  with no disk in it sits there and thunks loudly about once a second which means i will keep it unplugged until i need it which is a pain since i was setting up a usb hub to make easy plugin
with a disk in it it is quiet but not sue how happy it will be when pull the hubs usb from the computerhave only tried readingi purchased one of these radios to listen to am talk radio while commuting
the am reception is good but not great
it takes some getting used to the backwards tuning dial which goes high to low which is the opposite of most other radios
what i like best about it is that it is very small  sturdy
i believe i have had the same batterys in it for over a year now and have not had to replace them
it does not get heavy use as i said earlier the reception is not what i had hoped but still gets several hours every week of play timemy grundig pe was a christmas gift  one week later it wouldnt turn on
please note this is an updated review my full revision and explanation is found below under the astrix ive installed new batteries and it wont work on the external power source either
the light works but nothing else will power upthis is frustrating and sadly grundig when it was a product made in germany was an outstanding line of radios
now that they are made in china there is no reliability in the productsid suggest buy at your own risk and understand that this radio has a short shelflifethe audio quality while typical for a radio having a speaker this small was good
it had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area miles away from fm transmitters
my old sony portable radio which i purchased and took to russia in  in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the usa finally died after  years
the grundig when it worked never performed as well as my sony made in japanbut i wasnt too disappointed with the performance of shortwave listening on this tiny radio
the sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the grundig and the sony had vastly superior audio despite having a speaker about the same size as the grundig
 update
this grundig radio easily dies often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days
i thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and i was about to shoot a video to post on youtube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it died
however i have been able to get this radio to working again on several occasions by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own that there is a very very tiny reset button under the batteries
it has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip
when i reset the radio its like it comes back from the dead and works
but that being said resetting this little monster is a frequent chorethis radio has good sound for a radio this small with verylittle overload on fm
not quite as selective as the yacht boy  but good
better than the sangean  and my sony walkmanthe am is good for nighttime listening but daytime listeninghas some interference
the shortwave reception is average even though it doesnt cover all the bands
the thing i like most about this radio is that its easy to carry aroundhello folks its vince the radioman
i have been a collector and a buff for many years  love to do compares 
this radio is generally ok no major complaints 
the tuner quality is good  although you can only tune down to a kh increment
much better quality than the ga
the sound is a bit brassy but clear
its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money i would rate this better than its competitor the sangean ats  
it has a little bit of a better tuner  better at noise reduction and it has an external ant
jack which is always a plus 
not the best radio for dxers because of the kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results 
grundigs construction quality leaves a bit to be desired  be careful its delicate
but all in all not a bad little radio 
if you get a sale buy itit is easy and comfortable to wear not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located by just two millimeters and i can not taste good if it fulfills its job welli bought this as a cheap fix for my polk dvdcd player which refused to play disks that worked on other machines lots of screen freezes
i inserted the cleaner per instructions followed the instructions on screen but it failed to complete the cleaning process
ejected tried again same thing
on the third go the cycle was completed
unfortunately dvds continue to freeze
so maybe the polk is a dud
in any case the cleaner didnt fix it and its tough to know which product is faultyive had nothing but trouble with sony dvd players
this ones audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on duallayer dvds
my previous one sonys pbdv couldnt play the second layer of any dvd  without skipping
i took that one back and the dealer couldnt get  replacement parts from sony
i love sonys design and features but i  wonder about their quality anymorenot the smallest or best built but not that bad
im not disappointed
that is more than i can say for many mp playersthis is a very well designed player
it shipped without instructions of any kind from audible but they are available on the webmine doesnt play mps well they sound fuzzy and distorted
as i use mine primarily for audio books its not a huge issue
if you get one check it right away for playing quality
i didnt and they wont allow me to return it nowmy biggest complaint is its sensativity
if i bump it it resets to the beginning of the audio track or song
i dont know if their other products do this but this one is awful in that regardim pleased with the vcr but it took about an hour to get it set up properly
plug amp play didnt work
i finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually and the initial configuration is relatively  complicated
i am a little bit disappointed with the remote
one reason  that i selected a jvc vcr is because i hoped it would interoperate well  with my other jvc components but the remote is awkward to use with my tv  and dbs
overall though it has a lot of nice features for the money and  the picture quality is goodthe sony mavica was my first color digital camera
although i took a lot of pictures with it i eventually bought another digital camera
the biggest problems with the mavica are
the resolution   by  just  isnt good enough
if you do any photo editing at all the quality suffers  because of the low resolution
you need at least a  by   resolution preferably more
the lcd is too hard to use especially  in strong light
you really need a viewfinder
the floppys just  dont store enough
if you go on vacation you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocketon the plus  side the battery life and x zoom are great
but that just doesnt make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above
do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution  and maybe youll only have to buy oneps
i traded up to a kodak dc and like it finefor entry level digital photography you could do far worse than the mavica
what sold me initially aside from the very reasonable price was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage
what this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your pc
it also means you dont have to worry about a free parallel serial or usb port which if youre a peripheral junkie like me is reason enough to give serious consideration to this cameraon the downside  yes there is one  the resolution is not what you might hope for
when used at normal size the pics are fine not great
theyre useable
when you try to increase the size to x or x the results are disastrous
the other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture but the camera does not function well indoors with available light
you really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right
sometimes its just not possibleso do i recommend this camera
yes with reservations
if youre looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare then look elsewhere
but if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price particularly for outdoor use check out the mavicai expected this to work seemlesly and it did so i do not have any complains
amazon had a great price compared to the local staples worked well for meused to label was a gift
as far as i know there are no complaints to the item shown abovehave a ptouch labeler
have you run out of printing tape
well here you go  just order this and youll be all set to label until you run out of things to labelnot much to say about label tape other than it works great for my labeler
label tape is way overpriced just like ink so i recommend trying to waste as little as possibleive used the brother labels machines for years and found them to be reliable
the supplies are kind of pricey but thats typical for dedicated devices with a captive market
on this tape though i noticed that the  tape theyve sold for years is now   talk about a chiselers approach to giving the customer lessi use a fair amount of this tape
i tried using this outdoors
that was a mistake
it faded in about  days
i sort of knew that would happen
i need to spend the extra money to get the laminated version
as long as you only use it for indoor items its just finei always have my kids peel the back off the tape cause i run out of patience
otherwise its fineptouch labelers are handy little gadgets that should be in every household
there are all sorts of things that need labels
if you have a ptouch you will discover the hundreds of things that you never realized would be ever so much better with a label
this blackonwhite tape for the ptouch is the basic label tape that the machine needs to be useful
the tape makes high quality durable glossy labels and works perfectly in the ptouch machinethe tape is good and works perfectly with my labeleri used to label most of my familys thingsit doesnt work very well with objects that need to wash with hot water or will go to microwave
the ink start to fade outis very difficult to peel the label when finished
but for the price i guess is ok if you can buy the original doiti got my wife the p labeler and these tapes to help her objective of organizing the entire housethese tapes work well a few notes black on clear are ok but black on white show up better
picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label  for that reason i favor black on white over black on clear certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off  we found  work best on gallon storage totes   just doesnt seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time
we use these  for labeling my daughters lunch items etc
for daycareit would be great if amazon basics had a replacement item that was a better value  if you do alot of labeling these brother products can get expensiveafter i printed a label i had a hard time peeling the backing off
it came off in rippedoff pieces leaving some behindi bought the brother tape titler machine  very good
it is easier than avery labels  i ordered the tape brother tz i thought it was black on white like the sample roll it is black on clear
i didnt open it
i would really like to just swap the tape for black on white but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases it seems such a hassle
i just put it one side
it sour onewhen i used this on nametags it wasnt quite clear it was kind of frosty looking
dont know why unless it was made for brother and not by themthe clear tape is great as a way to replace engraving
it does have a gloss like scotch tape and is not quite invisibleim neither thrilled nor disappointed with this purchase
for the price it seems to work well
plug it in press the button and talk
people sometimes talk back
it worksi returned this item i found an older production year so i could do the channel mods i wanted i love the radio the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands downcool little radio  transmits very well  but reception is very poor
low volume and what seems to be high level of background hum on receive
not sure if i can live with it
will come back and revise with full eval lateri cant tell how well it works because i have yet to receive any voice on any channel and i live within sight of one of the mostheavilytravelled interstate highways by wheelers
maybe reception will improve once its mounted on my truck with a better antenna  it couldnt get any worsethe etxec has magnification of x great for looking at the moon
however if you want to look at any planets or stars you definitely need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification
without these optional eyepieces you have no control over magnificationthe etx is in many ways a marvelous little scope
optically its far and above most mm catadioptric scopes like the celestron  mechanically though it leaves a bit to be desired
there are a few too many flimsy  plastic parts the clock drive is not terribly accurate and the drive  clutch has way too much slop in itthe human engineering aspect leaves a  lot to be desired as well
the finder scope is almost impossible to use as  set up
the mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in  many orientations
what meade tried to do here is create a clone of the   questar at a bargain price
optically theyve done well though it  still falls short of a questar but in copying the mechnical design opf the  questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the questar  such a pleasure to usethe  price is a little misleading
while  designed for tabaletop use unless you have a cast concrete tabletop youll  need a solid tripod to support it so you can add another  right there  bringing the actual cost to more like 
and for that price there are a  lot of good choices around
they make not look as slick but theyre a lot  more usableheres my original reviewi bought this because just received a new mbpro  nonretina as a gift
im headed to help coordinate a conference tomorrow so i ordered this lock to protect my laptop
i didnt want a combination lock because ive had those get all mixed up  unusable thankfully not while connected to my laptop
sadly this lock does not fit the new mbpro
i cant even get the lock into the kensington slot plus the metal stubs scraped up the surrounding area on my brand new comp
the scrapes arent a huge deal but im sad given ive only had the comp a couple weeksnow im headed off to target in hopes of finding something
im just sad about the ridiculous price im gonna have to pay
if theres something im missing id love to hear about itheres the updateafter i had no success finding a lock at target best buy was closed i came home  worked the lock some more
i finally got it to work but im not sure what i did any differently i lined up the tbar with the stubs put it in the slot  turned the key to the left
i just hope it doesnt act fussy when i get where im goingi thought i was buying the kensington  but what i received from amazon was a discontinued  commercial model with an hp approved logo on the box and black hpbranded keys
it works ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration
its not worth the trouble of returning but i feel somewhat cheated since i saw an identical unit on ebay what happens is that pci tv cards clog up your pci bus bandwidth slowing down the computer while the viewer is on especilly on a older computer with a pci  nonagp video card
you are also not able to have the tv viewer on while playing games with either pci or agp video card
if a scheduled show brings up the tv while you are playing a game the game ati player most common both or the whole computer will crashthis doesnt get a  rating because of the great software features
still and motion video capture is awesome
the scheduler is great though useless to gamers with this particlular card see above
ati tv cards are better than the other tv cards out there when it comes to the features
it is better than microsoft webtv too built into windows  alsojust get atitv with the amc ribbon cable connector if you have an older computer ati pro turbo expression rageii or older video card or the new ati allin wonder radeon is newest if you have a newer one
just dont get this card atitvwonder or any other pci bus tv cardif you have a nonati video card then you are stuck with this card as it is compatible with nonati cards but atitv and the allinwonder require ati graphics
but in any case there is no integrated solution for gaming as of yet ati video cards are not good enough for serious d gaming unless you can get a multivideo card system runningi used to have a lot of respect for teac products but some years back they took the cheaplymade consumer electronics route and its been downhill ever since
that said this is a decent machine and i enjoyed it during its short life
shortly after my warranty expired of course i accidentally bumped the cd tray when it was open one day knocking the gears and everything out of whack and it was all overnever could get the tray to go back in right or the cd door to stay closed
the unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet
handle with carelet me start by saying that when i scanned all of my cds in to itunes to work with my ipod and iphone i deliberated long and hard about the compression rate i would use and i finally settled on bit aac with explicit stereo because i really could tell the difference between various setting after comparing them with carefully chosen songs
and i do regret a bit not having done apple lossless format now
by this im trying to say i have sensitive earsi was so looking forward to the teac ad to solve all my problems
 i really wanted to be able to control cassettes with a remote control and  i wanted a real singledisc cd player that functioned as such instead of using a dvd player to play cds which is slower and inconvenientthe track number is not displayed the screen saver often engages so you have to hit buttons more than once after a time etcthe first thing i did when i unpacked the teac ad was to set it up and attached it to my tuner so that i compare it against my existing equipment
the cassette player was the most disappointing
i currently have a pioneer ctwdr which remains the best sounding cassette player i have ever encountered or read about online that has a reasonable cost
i chose two cassettes to compare mainly because i new that the magnetic tape in them was in excellent condition and has great sound quality
these were the dealer by chico hamilton and introspective by the pet shop boys
i tried both with speakers and with headphones
the teac sounded pretty good i must admit
however when you compare it against my current pioneer it paled in comparison
the pioneer had far greater treble response yielding a far more vibrant and crisp sound
there was also a far greater depth with the pioneerthat feeling that you can reach into the sound to touch the individual instruments
i should say that i had dolby noise reduction off on both units
i mean the teac does sound far better than my two sony cassette walkmen
however the promise of a remote control was not enough for fogive the lesser sound qualitythe cd section of the teac is less dissapointing
i was comparing it to a sony dvdrecorder rdrgxd
the similarity was much closer here
however i have to say that the sony came out slightly ahead of the teac
the tonal quality of the reproduction was a bit richer and the highs were a bit more crisp
this might boil down more to a matter of personal preference rather than absolute superiorityso alas im going to return this unit and limp a long with the functional deficiencies in my current equipment in exchange for better sound qualityas the author of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tent and a former radio discjockey that worked in several electronic stores i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the s and steac wr dual fulllogic cassettethe teac unit gives you the ability to play on both portions of the deck and record on one
although you may be tempted to use high speed dubbing take the extra time and record in the normal mode
very few decks especially in the price range of  were able to offer trouble free highspeed dubbingthe old saying you get what you pay for is realistic
the construction is not made for heavy use on a daily basis and you need to operate the controls with care and not reckless abandonif you take it easy on the controls and use but dont abuse for the price you will be satisfiedas always try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy resultsenjoy the music and be wellcraig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tentthis is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better
simple to use and can be used multiple timesim writing this review at the urging of amazoncom but its really a bit early
i bought a couple of maxell vp dry video head cleaners because i planned to copy a lot of old vhs tapes to dvd on my new vcrdvd recorder
ive successfully used it about five times total on three vcrs
in the last attempts when i inserted the cartridge it immediately started rewinding and i had to stop it and hit play
it doesnt always play
this has happened on two vcrs
sothe jurys still out on this product
i think im supposed to get about  uses
ill come back and edit my review if i have any new informationamazon is sending a replacement
unfortunately mine arrived damaged and i had to return it
they say dry tape head cleaners are better than wet
maxwell has been in vhs and cassettes for awhile so i imagine it will be worth the investment
im hoping to download my video collection on dvd
so it will get much usethis product im sure works in some cases but in the case of my vhs cleaning job it did not work
it did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture
i gave it  stars rather than one star because i dont know if a wet vhs head cleaner would have done the job better and i made a poor selection or if the vhs is failing in a different wayi have a panasonic tv with built in vcr
vcr doesnt work and tapes were getting stuck
i thoughthoped this would do the trick
it didnt help
i will try to use it on my other vcrs
maybe they need some help before they go bad tooi bought these speakers for my pool deck i live in florida
i mounted them to my stuccocovered walls using toggle bolts to attach the included brackets
these little speakers look great and really have decent bass response considering their size
it probably helped they were mounted in corners
i am greatly disappointed by the rusting of the metal face though
they have only been out for about six months and the mesh cover is already rusting
outdoor speakers should not have this issue  stainless or galvanized steel should have been used for the mesh and then paintedi would rate these four stars for sound but only three because of the poor weatheringthe headphones look better than older koss sparkplug but the sound quality is much worsei found them uncomfortable for long use
i took the spongy parts off the ends and cut the tips off some other earplugs i have so the sound could travel through and that works well only because it keeps the purplesilver part away from my ear cartillage
that part is rather large and they wont go far enough into my ear to stay there comfortably
theyll work but my search isnt oversound is good from these cans though not excellent
they do a fair job isolating outside noise though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces
the audio quality is basically what id expect at this price point so no real complaint therebut the cables are terrible
stiff and they transfer the noise of everything they touch
any slight movement that rubs against the wires translates that sound into your ears
if you want to sit perfectly still thats not a problem
but terrible for the gym or most any other part of life that includes movement on your partmy old headphones stopped working on a hour flight from nyc to la
though my headphones were already not the best blah set that came with my mp player i hadnt had the inclinationenergy to buy another pair until i was desperate
in other words i was too lazy
well i was now headphoneless and desperate so it was time to spring for a new onei tend to like the in ear headphones because of the sound quality that comes through in loud environments loud cities subway airplanes road noise
i bought the koss plug with hopes that the earpluglike earbuds would fit perfectly into my ears
i have normalsized ears and dont usually have problems with storebought earplugs for bedtime
however no matter how much i played around with the foam plugs on the koss set after  minutes of fantastic sound yes the sound is amazing
 the plugs would just voluntarily fall out of my ears for no apparent reason
i tried squeezing pinching twisting pushing pulling and even switching various plug sizes etcbut with no luck
and even though im feeling the burden of returning to the store circuit cityamazons price is cheaper my koss plug is going back
i dont want to superglue the plugs into my ear to listen to music
thats not the idea herebut take note the bass and general sound of the plug is fantastic
if it fits your ears lucky thing you stick with this one for the sound and the cost
otherwise dont waste your money
it will only add to your pile of things i may use one day and we all have too much of that stuff dont wenote i received a a black model
also they are ported holes on the outside of the housing to allow pressure transfer but which dont seem to diminish noise isolationpro the noise isolation with these is great the eartips are the squishy foam just like hearos and other earplugs
the result is a really good seal with your ear canal
when riding the bus or walking around i am able to turn my ipod down from  volume to around 
its a huge differencecon the cord is composed of a spongy grippy rubber
its the perfect material to use on those dashboard grips you see advertised where you put something on it like a cellphone and it stays put
however for a cord its annoying as it prevents you from wrapping it and it just feels stiff and icky
the cord also transfers a lot of vibration noise to your ears when you are in motion
maybe this is normal for all earcanal headphones
i dont have enough experience with them
its my guess that a less stiff springy material might have been bettersolution run the cord for one ear over the back of your neck if your neck is small enough as it will reduce the pull on your earsbought these for me to try since my tecki son asked for these for himself
ive got little ears and find these extremely uncomfortable
i shoot shotguns so i know how to use foam ear plugs but these are just too big for me
ill probably give them to my husband who has big old ears
most other ear buds ive bought include three sizes of ear cushions these have only twobig and bigger
the sound quality is heavy on bass with no treble
i dont know squat about ohms and hz or other sound lingo but i do know what i like to hear in my music and these just dont cut it for me
i usually dont pay more than  for ear buds because the right ear sound always quits after awhile
even the bose had this problem after  months
these looks like they are well made and i do like the fact that theres a flex joint at both the ear buds and the pluginthese are ok earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my zenm they are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and i find the sound quality on the koss spark plugs much betteri got these in spite of some of the poorer reviews because i wanted some  earphones small enough to slip in my purse but my ears are too small or  shaped in such a way that regular earbuds are impossible andor painful to  wear
this seemed like the perfect alternativeand it could be
however the quotslowrecoveryquot foam earplugs included are more like  fastrecovery
ive never seen foam earplugs that go to full size again so  fast
they really are tough to get in if you leave the headphones insertedthe trick i found was to slip the plugs off the headphone pieces roll  it up really tight and insert just the plug into your ear
then slightly  move it around until the hole for the headphone is lined up and stick them  in through the hole
thats the only way i think you could ever get the  things in your earother than that im pleased enough with them
they  definitely are way more comfortable for me and stay in better than regular  earbuds
really makes you wonder though if they even had actual consumers  try the earplugs out before releasing themdidnt see that they were any better than other buds i have
again ok for the money
yo yo yocannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly making it impossible to create adequate sound isolationi cant simply understand nature of such negative feedbacksdont like sound qualitydurabilityusabilityetc
 check price tag scratch your head try to find same durabilityusabilityetc for same price i bet you cantso this headphones perform amazingly well compared to their  price tag
so dont expect  quality from theseif you still wonder what quality of sound these have heres comparison with other koss products
this the plug sounds worse than koss porta pro but sounds better than koss ur but you need heavy eq usage to actually set these plugs to be better then ur
hope this helpsbeen using these ear plugs for may years  and i like them
good sound inexpensive and they stay in my ears and block external sounds quite wellbiggest complaint  the cord  rather the rubber used
if they would upgrade the cord to something more like the ipod headphones this would be great
the cord has memory for curls bends etc
wont stay straight
just a bit annoyingdifferent productions have either straight or  degree phone jacks
i have had both
the  degree version seems more relaibleonly one oddity  different productions seem to have different sounding driver frequency responses
some of them seem to be overly bright in treble others seem to be heavy in the bass
i just wish they were consistantupdate  ive stopped using this product and switched to a similar skull candy product
i used koss for years and was a loyal customer
i kept having these break at a rate of about one a month and i was gentle with them
i think the company has seriously cut back on quality
i liked the sound and foam sound blocking but reliability became a problemoriginal reviewive owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under for me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise
you can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones but if theres a baby crying next to you well youre sound experience is going to be less than ideal
for a city denizen like me common noise pollution is subway trains sirens chatty cell phone blatherers etc
airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise
the plug by blocking outside noise so effectively solves this problemanother bonus you dont see often is that koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty
send them a check for  to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs even if you dont have a receipt
the plug is big sound in a very portable package
im hookedi like quality soundi do not like easily drop of my ears i have to squeeze hard to fix the ear and it bothersthese really are fine headphones particularly for use inside a motorcycle helmet
but they are cheaply made compared to for example the headphones bundled in an ipod
the wiring insulation is a little sticky and gets tangled easily and the wires themselves are highgauge and skinnyedit ok after months of use the plug headphones just keep holding up for dozens and dozens of motorcycle trips
my earlier accusations of flimsiness were obviously illinformed these  headphones are a fantastic deal and they outlasted my ipod original headphonesedit  i finally beat the heck out of these headphones and decided to replace them after about  years of wearing a motorcycle helmet over them
overall a very good value for the money
the new headphones work just as well except that koss has replaced the smooth pvc wire insulation with some new stuff that has a roughened sticky texture
and it does stick to itself and to everything else making them slightly less functionalmade from cheap materials but an okay productthe koss vc  volume control works well
however it is cheaply made  if you start to leave the room without removing your headphones you might find yourself needing a new volume control
spend a little more  get one that is not so flimsy
again to its credit the device what it was designed fori bought this in order to inexpensively kill the agc of my video capture card
when the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible there was lots of crackling and distortion
upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncatedclipped
depending on what its connected to its good for slightly controlling the volume however look into using an amp instead for maximum volume controlthese work fine but have a short working lifespan
i have owned two vcs and both stopped working in stereo then altogether
they were used only for listening in bed so they were not abused
i liked the volume control but would like to see them better made even at a higher pricethis works well but maybe i am short well no maybe but the wires for this are so long it detracts a little from the enjoyment end up bundling them together
main thing is they work wellthis item is an inexpensive handy item to adjust the volume on your ipod etc without using the control of the ipodhowever this is not an amplifier but a vclume control onlyfeels pretty darn cheap and the cable is frighteningly thin but i have had this thing for years and have not been particularly nice to it and it still worksit worked quite nicely for a few months but then the sound started cutting outwill buy again as it is the only product ive found to add inline volume control to headphones for any device not just iphones which i dont have or like also   times a year is definitely worth the convenience in my mindthe connection between the headphones and the volume control doesnt seem to be too great
while adjusting the volume using the koss volume control one or both ear buds will stop working until i hit a sweet spot on the volume dialthis product gets three stars for being the exact product i needed
i couldnt find any other offerings for a headphone extension with potentiometer volume controls
it loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as i got it in the mail due to a low quality cable that easily breaks insideproduct works ok but the tiny wheel volume control is difficult to turn i have to use my finger nail to really turn it
other than that i am happy with it
not really a professional volume controller but it does the job what do you want for such a cheap price it is cheap
i know its ok works as expected just dont think its going to last long cause seems like cheap light plasticconstructedone of the first things i do when im buying new ear buds is check the cord length
the majority of ear buds these days have cords that are much too short for everyday use often resulting in the ear buds pulling out of your ears or the cord coming unplugged from whatever device youre using
this is where an extension corddevice such as this one is very useful
like many people i sit at a desk in front of a computer all day listening to music much of that time
the ipod dock that i have on desk is just far enough away that my ear buds dont quite reach and wearing them isnt practical or comfortable
thus i purchased this item to add some cord length and some extra volume control
here are my thoughtspros adds approximately  in cord length volume control switch is at the end of the cord and has a clip to attach to whatever youre wearing or carryingcons sound degradation is extremely noticeable
feels approximately like a  loss of sound because of the extended connection
while i expected some loss i didnt expect quite this much
the volume switch barely raises the overall volume unless you have your device volume at max flimsy wiring and weak connections tend to short out quickly if there is moderate or active use amazons stock photo doesnt exactly match the item i received
my model matches the customer image that was submitted so there are slight differences such as the angle of the male end of the plug
could be problematic for somewhile this item is useful to me in my particular situation id rate it poor overall
it works for me because it will stay at work on my desk and not see any travel use
since i dont listen to my music very loud at work as i need to hear if coworkers are speaking to me the low volume isnt a huge issue for me
however if youre looking to purchase an extension for your normal headphones to carry with you this is not the device for you
especially if youre going to be around a lot of noise or people talking ie
the bus train subway etc
if youre going to be in any of those situations youre better off going with a different producti have owned two of these
i love the product till it stops working which it will
mine lasted longer than the  day warranty but both died within a year
the wires start cutting out without any noticeable exterior damageim using this with a set of cambridge soundworks  speakers since the original volume control stopped working and they no longer sell replacementsthe cable is thin and of decent length but it is not that robust so i dont know how much abuse it can takei dont know what the circuitry is in on the inside but for my speakers i have to have the knob at a very low setting otherwise the sound volume gets outrageously loud
as a result unless i have it above a certain level i only get sound at the appropriate sound level from one channel
if i increase the volume then both channels sound fine
so that is slightly irritating but other than that works wella gadget that is nice to have
gives an extra length for extension
some static noise when adjusting the volumethese things are always temporary
fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output complete with volume control on the tv remote so i dont need to replace this inline volume controlnothing wrong with the product but it wasnt sturdy enough to really last  and nothing else ive tried was either
the designers apparently have never lived with their own products
if they listen to music or tv at all they probably dont use earphonesreview by tony
we both use plant ladys amazon account these days
she has never used earphones and knows nothing about the highly technical science of running them off a tv setworked just fine but someone stepped on it and it easily broke
i may get another one though
it is very inexpensethe view shows a  degree jack but the actual product is a normal straight on jack
the normal straight on jack will have stress on it
i bought this because my rca hdtv has a headphone buzz probably due to proximity to the the light source
if i had it to do over again i would get an led hdtv back light
much less chance of buzzingnothing serious
the volume seems no different from when i control it via my phone
the only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket
not impressed at allthis product has been mediocre since the beginning
when adjusting the volume control the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner
after just a couple of months of use there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume
sometimes rapidly turning the dial from min to max several times alleviates the problem for a few hours
this product is good if youre looking for an inexpensive throwaway solutionthis product works fine but when i tag it along with my jvc headphone the combined wire length becomes unmanageableif youre using this for headphones its probably fine
i was trying to use it as a replacement volume puck for amplified speakers and the cable is so poorly insulated that all sorts of noise comes through
the volume control is nice and it is very smalli bought these headphones because they collapsed into a portable state
unfortunately the bag though of very nice material was not at all big enough to enable me to store the phones in it
the whole experience of trying to fit the collapsed phones into the bag was quite frustrating and im surprised that an otherwise good sounding pair as these were but not great would be matched with such an unsatisfactory bag as far as size is concerned
however i did lol use the bag for other things and was very happy with the bag in this casei found the sound quality not up to the past reviews which gave the portapros such a great reputation thoughthere are great phones for sure
i have a collection of over ear on ear and inear phones and developed some critical listening ability and in my experience the koss sound good
im not going to discuss all the genres for the sake of time but they did sound good for classical and rock and edm
the retrodesign is fine but the mechanics of leaves me wary
it does catch my hair on a consistent basis and despite the pressure settings over the ear they somehow cause discomfort within an hour
im thinking that a relatively small percentage of people would share that experience
i do like the folding mechanism and the life time warranty
nice
yes people say you get a lot for the money but unless these are your only phones id likely be reaching out for my other phonesbought these for christmas they dont fit to head very well and tend to snap off if bumped
these are very light weight
they are still working thoughthese headphones are ok but they look cheap since they are and i didnt notice much difference in the sound quality from my sparkplugs to these
i couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears but for the price you could certainly do worse
honestly though if your willing to go to in ear headphones go with the spark plugs the are better at noise isolating fit better in your ears and i really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality  theyre like half the pricei didnt care much for these the first time i heard them tried them again and liked them very much but later just seemed flat and not much life in there
at first a wrote a positive review but the more i listen the less i likeread all the reviews before buying it and had expected more
but in reality i really should not have since i didnt pay too much for it
the main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isnt stiff enough and i find i have to make sure im putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in
other than that i think it is okay
im not much of an audiophile so ill leave the sound quality and what not to those in the knowto anyone who hasnt tried all the various types of headphones it is important to remember exactly what these are cheap portable onear headphones
they give a totally different sound then inears or closed design phones but for what they are i would say theyre good
i currently own six pairs of phones from stock apple earbuds to sennheiser hd s
gave my portapros a run on both my computers sound card and mp player using  kbps mps or better
the clarity is good and theyre very lightweight
the folding design is simple but effective
the look is certainly retro and unique although i didnt find it as comfortable as many have claimed
earpads are very thin and made my ears sore after  minutes of listening although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the comfort zone feature tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads
the cord seems to be an average thickness but i wouldnt get too rough with these
the steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily just watch out that the slider doesnt catch your hair
despite the sore ears the phones are very lightweight overallback to the sound as you would expect its good for a portable phone but hardly earth shattering
at flat eq the clarity is good although the highs can sometimes be harsh
bass is weak as expected even with eq adjusted up
to be fair a portable onear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an inear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers
no sound isolation offered if youre into that sort of thing
cool s phones though ive certainly owned better portable onears sony makes excellent phones in this category
soundstage is very narrow and lacks body
a good value if you can get them for under thirty otherwise id rather invest in a nicer pair of phones
if were talking about value theyre a good buy compared to new stock apple buds
if youre trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones theres really no comparison at allupdate after  hours of burnin time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way
highs are still harsh and bass is still underwhelming
i sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collectioni got my portapro phones yesterday and i am frankly disappointedmy intention was to use these phones with my computer for music listening at late hours
i was instantly defeated by the useless foot cord length
i should have checked that out but managed to miss it
nearly every headphone designed for home use as these originally were come with at least five or six feet of cordlength
so right there i was out of luck
oh well i thought i can always use them with my mp playermy second discovery is that koss like many headphone manufacturers is targeting its smaller phones for the highly lucrative ipod market
this means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots
not surprisingly the phones have a cordlength thats right for the ipod crowd but not home users
further the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into hiphop but at the cost of a balanced natural sound
i would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant but rather unnatural
the low end is very exaggerated and the midrange is down about db
the highs are also way down perhaps  or db
using my players equalizer i can make the sound acceptable but these phones are typical of the bass is what the kids are buying school of design
without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a bassheavy sound that lacks any definition in the allimportant midrange
im a lifelong headphone listener who has used grado sennheiser akg and even highend electrostatics
i know good phones
these disappoint
i suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who dont use headphones muchone other point
koss has been praised for its generous warranty
maybe but read the fine print
koss will replace or repair the phones their option if you provide a check for  and suitable packaging
picture that
i spend  for repairs  for a shipping box requiring a postoffice visit another  for shipping and still another trip to the postoffice
some lifetime warranty
incidentally i would estimate the phones cost a maximum of  to make
seriously i base this estimation on material costs and the manufacturing processes which i am familiar within conclusion i cannot recommend these phones to anyone who values balanced sound over punchy bassthe koss portapro headphones are extraordinarily portable as they fold and slide into an small extremely space
however they never retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses even when not folded due to design limitations
they also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting
if you do not need portability as your overriding choice factor you can do much better with other koss headphone models or other top rated brands so keep lookingwhen i wear headphones i have them on for hours
i needed a pair of headphones to replace a pair of old sony mdr ssimilar to sony vsok the speaker diaphrams on the koss porta pros are very goodthe problems i have with the koss porta pros is the comfort
the ear pads are smaller than most peoples ears
so the ear pads rest on the inner ridges of your ears combine this with a spring headband that naturally wants to curl up will provide just enough tension to irritate your ears within  hoursthe position locks on the sides of the headband do not lock in any way you pick up the headphones with one hand and the earpieces flip to the inside of the headbandthe cable is a little short and quite flimsysummarysound good but not too comfortablebetter choice  sennheiser hd full cup great sound for the price it sells its not worth it even you can fold them and they have a good bass soundi decided to keep it but would not reccommend it unless the price is  purchased different koss model much happier now keeping both pairsi loved the headphones when i first got it
but the annoyances didnt take long to appear
and they all have nothing to do with the audio quality of this productthe headphones will pull your hair no matter how short it is
i trimmed my hair down to half a centimeter and the bands still manage to somehow yank on it
very annoying
so as long as you are bald or intend to use these over a cap you should be fine
otherwise stay awaysecondly i have an issue with the durability of the cablecord on the connector
i used this on my ipod touch for not even a whole month and the rubber had tore off
i had to use some electrical tape over that part to keep the cord from further damage
although they have an unconditional lifetime warranty i have not gotten around to sending these back for a replacement yetnot a bad pair of headphones at all
excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum
once you get below hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq
its defintely high quality bass sound not muddy just soft
extremely comfortable
i just expected these to have better bass response than they didsound effect is good but i see more negative pt about this product than its basic feature of good sounds and bass the cover spoilt rather easily iucky i have bought the replacement pack together the metal headband and the plastic catch comes off easily i have to carefully remove from my head as if you had bend it more when removing from your head the plastic catch will be loose and the headset will be separated into  i have to repair it a few timesnow i am extra careful when removing from my head the cable is way too short
only about m i thinki am using in on my pclucky i have front speaker jackdefinately will not be able to fit the back panel speaker jackive tried out a number of portable headphones and these are the best ive found so far
this is the second pair ive purchased since i liked the first set so well and wanted another for my laptop bagprosgood sound quality lightweight comfortable fold up easily into a carry bag so its portable
the folded set fits very nicely into limited laptop storage compartmentsconskinda flimsy feel although ive had the first pair for over a year with no problems
they also look a bit dorky but eh whateveroverall i think this is a nice choice for the priceupdate  i had the wire to the right phone short out after just over  year
this pair doesnt get folded that often and these are foldable travel type phones so i dont think that reflects well on the unit
ive downgraded to  stars based on this issuedecent clean sound
the offset design has advantages and disadvantages
they fold up all right but seem to spring back to a preset width so you can adjust and leave them in one position
not disappointed and the price is pretty goodi purchased these headphones to replace my sennheisers px
for several months i was happy
the sound quality is right up there with the px
however i use headphones pretty much everyday for running exercising walking etc
i need them to last and take a beating
i am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp player detaching it from the plug
now after maybe  months of use i have lost sound in the right ear
it sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece
it is pretty much unrepairable
the sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted  years
i guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy  of these for the price of  px
im not sure if i will try to buy these again yet
it seems that the part where the cable enters the headphone is the weak link in a lot of portable headphones
or maybe i am just too rough with themi bought them through a relatives recommendation
they sound great with classical and vocals but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a busi bought these headphones based on the good reviews about the sound quality and the comfort but i find them to be very uncomfortable
the collapsible band has two plastic pieces which press into the top of my head
there is no way to keep them away from my head without having the headset so loose that it falls off
maybe i just have a small head or not enough hair but i like my sennheiser pxs better
they have a padded band which is very comfortable and i never feel the headset pressing on the top of my head and the sound quality is just as goodso it folds up
thats nice
it sounds pretty good
thats also nice
but it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so im expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bendingthis are pretty okay in about every way
i suppose you might be disappointed after waiting  years to buy them but tough luck palaudio quality is great for the price bracket but they feel flimsy
however i havent goofed up and done anything bad to them yet
i just wish that the build quality was a little better so i wouldnt be paranoid every time i used themi have been having grado labs sr and sr for a couple of years but koss portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my gradosokay i finally pulled trigger two weeks ago
my initial impressions are only burned in for about  hours bass is a little too much thats expected and is a selling point for portapros
but with eqing i can make it a bit better to my taste sound is not too clear overall comparing with grados of course but this may improve over time with more burned in based on my prior experiencesmy sources are very decent mp players and laptop with external sound card
no external amps were used in any wayin the end portapro lives within my expectations
i like them for their compact shape portability which grado lacks comfort slightly worse than grados
i think these are not as good as grado labs sr and sr if a straight comparison has to be made
value wise i would go to sr if you can buy used
if you only buy new electronics then these are really good valuesmy only problem with these is a big one for me comfort
after maybe an hour or so they begin to really hurt my ears
people rave on here about how comfortable they are i dont get it
i have an average size head so i dont think my ears or dome piece is the issue
the circular foam pads around the speakers are very thin and the round speaker pieces underneath have hard edges that press through the foam and onto your ear
after a while it begins to hurt not like make you bleed and cry hurt but just slight dull pain from pressure
i have had these for about a year and use them daily at work
i still havent gotten used to them i doubt my ears will develop defensive callouses
other than that these have good sound and look cool for the moneyedit ive had these for about a year and a half
i am soso about them and definitely dont love them
they have not stopped hurting my ears but ive gotten somewhat tolerable to it
fyi back then i purchased the grado srs at the same time and found them to also have the same supercheap extremely uncomfortable padding so i returned them
i kept the koss phones since they were cheap and didnt require a headphone amp or purchasing an additional plug adaptori have been looking for onear headphones since then so if anyone has any recommendations on an upgrade thats comfy and sounds amazing id love to hear from you
happy shoppingfor a dare i say cheap pair of headphones the sound is great
my biggest complaint is adjusting the fit is tedious
the comfort zone switch always pops back to the tightest setting unless you first get the headphones situated and then carefully slide the switch while being careful not to bump the pivot point and pop the switch back to firm
also the adjustable headband fights against its own springiness and its hard to make it hold at anything other than wide open or completely closed
finally if you slide the headband adjustment while the headphones are on your head you will almost inevitably pull hair into them
if you dont plan on folding them up much for transportation i would recommend looking at a different pairi bought these after comparing multiple different headphones
i was going to choose other headphones although the review on cnet changed my opinion
there are really only two upsides to these headphones
  they sound good particularly in the low frequencies and  they fold up small
so what are the downsides
  any time you take them off they shrink back down to their original size
you have to readjust them every time which gets annoying fast
  the things looks hideously ugly
  even though they have a setting to control how hard it squeezes you head the pad above the speaker part rests on the side of your head and it will soon start digging into the side of your mellon
admittedly i have a larger than normal head but these were very uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time
i finally fixed this problem by bending the metal band out a lot
this modification made it so they dont fold up as small anymore
  there is a hook above the right ear that you use to latch the headphones closed when stored
this hook rubs on my ear if im not careful which very quickly causes pain to the top of my ear
  if the band adjusts while you are wearing the headphones there is a good chance it will suck your hair into the band which isnt a problem until you try to remove them which quickly becomes unpleasant when you realize what has happened
as a note my hair isnt long in fact i keep it with a military type crew cut so this is a problem for anyone with head hair regardless of lengthoverall given the choice to go back in time i would have selected different headphones
i got these on sale and the price is pretty good however they just arent very comfortable
bending the top band helps but then they dont fold up as small
they do sound really good but they also dont block out outside noisesi have those for almost  year now and i just love them
they will not insulate the surrounding noise like the inear type phones but they sound perfectly  very balanced enough bass clear highs and enough mids and are comfortable to wear
i am finding myself preferring them among the  sets of different headphones i own for anything on my laptop and on my portable when i am listening to music evenings at home
highly recommended for any purpose at relatively silent surroundingsedit one earpiece easily broke when they fell from the table on the floor
way too easy
not that durable at the end
taking some stars backi agree that qualitywise and comfortwise and portabilitywise they are very good headphones
but they slipped off my hands one day and brokeupdate on the other hand i mailed them back to koss and got them replaced no questions askedive own porta pros since the middle s
they were my first good pair of headphones and i still have a pair todayback when i first got them i thought these were a god send
they simply blew me away
i had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass
but then again i was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with walkmans
so the porta pros were a big step up the food chain
more then twenty years later and about five different pairs the thin wire constantly breaksthey sound a little bass heavy to me now
i now do most of my listening with a pair of grado srs
much better all around but twice as expensive
my first pair cost me about  and that was as in s dollars
so if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal
and remember folks they come with a life time guarantee
the last two times that they stopped working i sent them in
the first time they were repaired
the second time i got a new pair
not bad
but what they should really do is improve the quality of the wire
even if it means an extra 
i would recommend these to most but not to the very active or to folks who tend to break things like my daughterlove you honeyjust as lots of others have said here these are greatsounding headphones
theyre comfortable and they stay on my head while working out and doing chores that require a lot of repetitive bending like laundry
but i only bought the pair in nov  now here it is june  and one side just died completely
i dont have the paperwork so the warranty is useless
lesson
next time keep the papers and register the headset so that if they break again i have some recourse
also the price is now about  higher than when i bought them last yearhaving recently sold my sony mdrv headphones good cans but no longer practical for my purposes i succumbed to the frequent hype surrounding the koss portapros and ordered a pair as a backup to my sennheiser pxs and if necessary as a replacementthey certainly are no replacement and i have yet to decide whether to keep them as a backup
headphone judgments can be highly subjective but heres one consumers observations  the portapros have a reputation as retrostylish but providing cuttingedge compensating sound quality
my first impression upon wearing them even before connecting them to a cd player was that the comfort level is not equal to the pxs
i was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant level comfort zone switch
admittedly the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones
theyre indeed high efficiency demanding less volume than the pxs producing an open noncanned and transparent sound in the midrange and offering  impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummers ride cymbal on the upper end
i began doing numerous ab comparisons noting that the portapros were immediately more arresting producing bright forward and instant reproduction of all frequencies at times making me wonder if the pxs werent just a trifle muddy
but soon the portapros began to sound slightly edgy and aggressive less balanced in their overall sound compared to the everpleasing sennheisers
then an achilles heel became unmistakable on a cd on which the portapros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless i backed off on the volume by 
with the pxs the same cd produced only the slightest hint of distortion which vanished when i cut back on the volume by a mere 
soon i wearied of the comparison the pxs had won the argument and rather convincingly at that
theyre slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the portapros at least without practice but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant
neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or dj work near a microphone  the portapros more so because of their extreme sensitivity which would certainly invite feedback
for that sort of work i depend on the largely overlooked koss urs
for comfort frequency range balance and longterm wearability i would take these fullsized but extremely lightweight headphones over not only the portapro and px but the sony phones mentioned above
the urs handled the overly hot bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement
their weakness is shoddy workmanship im on my nd pair the head webbing came detached after a couple of months use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short
if you purchase either koss be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of koss famous lifetime guaranteei am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone
it does output strong bass but overall sound is muffled
the high is very weak barely audible
i prefer the koss ksc and sennhauser px for they both produce a more balanced sound than the portaproyes i know they have a lifetime warranty
but i have to pay shipping there and shipping  back
so for a  set of headphones i have to pay a third of the cost to get a replacementthat said great bang for the buck with audio quality
good bass but clear not boomy like cheapos
however the cord frayed within  months and im hearing occasional audio go out
i think the quality of the build is a  out of  but the audio is  out of  be aware you are getting a cheaply made product that outperforms the price
im personally going to look to switch over to grados or something that seems more durableive been through so many headphones and many have sounded fine such as this set however whats the point of having a decent sound when the construction itself doesnt last more than a year
honestly i think im done buying lowpriced sets with their fragile construction
and by this i mean that in  of the broken cans ive had its the wire connection to the plugwhat bothered me the most about this set was that i never really used it in any aggressive manner
its just time and movement of any kind has weakened that connection
it shouldnt be the caseregardless im late to the game on reviewing this product so i dont expect to change anyones minds
if youre in the market for a cheaply made but decent sounding set of headphones to get you through a shortterm period this might be recommended
for my part i think its time to spend more and shoot higheri bought this as a gift so the largely negative feedback was really dishearteningit sounds worse than cheap  total crap earbudsit looks so futuristicit snags hairit takes quite a bit of force to pull them apart for putting on headthe same tightness that makes keep squishing together and inhibiting easy donning of them puts some unnecessarily pressure on the head and negatively impacts comforttheyre getting used
so used when i asked to borrow them to verify sound issues or find some resolution to the issues mentioned they have not been produced so i can assess whats up
if they sounded that bad and were that annoying then i would have handed them to me for a return the first week
she hasnt even managed to give them to me to check them out and now i cant return through amazoni suppose you shouldnt expect spectacular sound at this price
the headphones are well made and comfortable
all in all worth the money
im satisfiedits good not as good as my other senheiser ones but for the price its really good it compares with headphones that cost  times more if the size does not matter
well isolated from outside world soundi think this is a very good sounding and comfortable headphone
it is light and you can wear them for hours without feeling pinchedhowever it is made out of cheap hard plastic
the first pair broke after a year and its replacement just broke again
so on average each pair lasted for about a year
both time the plastic pieces broke and the headphone practically flew apartgood thing is koss offers lifetime warranty  for each repair
the downside is shipping it back to them is not cheap and you will be headphoneless for  weeks
i think i will use the cheapest us mail to ship it back this timei will use my proaa while the r is in the shop
the proaa is heavier but also much more durable the parts are all aluminum
unfortunately it does not sound as good and it pinches my ears quite a bit for long duration listeningi loved these headphones at first
great basssound quality was above standard for the price
but i cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the faulty construction
the plugin bent almost right away distorting the sound almost the first week i got it
i didnt have an option at the time so i used them tell i found my earbuds
then they broke again completely severing the right side of the headphones from the rest of it
dont buy it
oh yea went on vacation forgot about the return policy time my fault then boom
i got stuck with broken headphoneskoss r reviewwhen my  year old highend headphones died a few months ago i went on the hunt for a replacement pairin all things my preference is to buy american made or at least american designed and owned so i looked first at koss
bose and several others qualify tooi have a bunch of very high end speakers and amplifiers rounding out at k for my primary system so my ears are spoiled
see my review of akg  headphones for listing of my test system and cds

if you move around a lot with headphones on slings are not for you

 closed cans and ear pads do not breath and can get very hot with a tight fit it may be the material the ear pads are made of possibly koss could add some venting to the closed cans to alleviate the heat buildup  sound quality is good not great but for the price  tenth of the akgs hard to argue with  sound stage is a bit narrow compared to akg s and audio technica open and closed s both x to x more money
narrow sound stage may be a result of the closed can damping implementation and the materiel in the padssummaryin reading the other koss reviews if you are looking for stationary listening affordable koss headphones the ur open backs may be a very good option since they both breath and allow the drivers to move freely without damping concerns
leakage would be a factor but the sound stage should be bigger and heat gonekoss ur collapsible overear headphonesmy impression is that that from a design point of view the r was a good first effort by the koss designers who should follow up by moving the r drivers and replaceable cord config to the r sling and bigger rounded ear pads configuration and offer the r in open and closed back cans like the at  if the sling and ear pad materials on the r config can be significantly upgraded for a few bucks the designers should do it
until koss addresses the heat build up issue they will always be at a significant disadvantage with an easily correctable problem
koss should benchmark their ur ur  and r vs the at  for fit and comfort and continue to use their existing highvolume highlyacclaimed driversclosed canclosedback dynamic audiophile headphones  mm drivers with neodymium magnet systems  mm connector w  adapteropen canaudio technica athad openair dynamic audiophile headphones with mm drivers with neodymium magnet systemskoss needs to decide the target market customer for each product and clearly state the applications on their web site commerce sites and packaging otherwise one is left guessing what the koss designers were thinking when they designed the unitsimply buying the units to see what they sound like and how they fit is both expensive and time consuming
head size recommendations would be giant plus on their web site
there must be several attractive people already working at koss that could model their headphones on their web site with different views showing the connected equipment and applications the cost to koss for providing more and better photos would be zero
alternatively koss could go all out and pay a professional photographer a few hundred for a photo shoot using koss employees wearing the headphones and jacked into the target equipment like ipod chair next to expensive stereo next to sampling kiosk in store sitting in an airplane pilots seat ham radio etcin the end i gave the rs to my  year old since her head is smaller than mine the clamping is not as tight resulting in less heat buildup
for listening to her ipod nano nintendo game and pc applications the headphones are perfect
they are her early christmas gift
i had planned to use them with my pc but too tight and too hot stereo and movie listening was a long shot based on the drivers that didnt work outrecommendationif your head isnt big and you are looking for some goodsounding inexpensiveheadphones this might be the pair for you for all stationary applications including sitting at your work cube jacked in
noise isolation is good
cans dont fold and they are not echonoise canceling so using them on the commuter train or airplane may not work
if you wear them walking around the neighborhood make sure you have great insurance since you would be likely to walk in front of a car or trucksound is tinlike little bass
i bought this for my nephew to use with his christmas kindle hd
i chose this due to reviews and because it seems durable for a child which it really is
very flexible comfortable really long cord
sound sound is good for the price just dont expect something outstanding for the size
but for simple video games and moviesmusic that you dont plan on playing at ear bursting levelsthis performs very well
i will easily recommend over cheap earbuds
something to travel with that is comfy sounds decent wont break and you wont cry over if loststoleni must say these headphones are definitely unique
the drivers are huge and so are the headphones themselves
these are insanely comfortable lightweight and easy to useaudio quality is the major problem here
these sound very subpar compared to other headphones in this price range
i would not recommend these whatsoeverif you are looking for headphones in this price range i would go for the monoprice  best headphones you can get under i was expecting a decent bass but the r is quite lean in bass
mids and treble are balanced to my ears but the lack of bass makes the r not suitable for listening to my music
build quality is better than i thought thoughi got these to muffle the bodily noises from the offices around mine
the headphones are well made and the sound is ok but the fit is poor
they cover my entire ears but they dont fit snugly against my head
theyre loosest at the bottom of the earcups at the bottom of my ears
a little adjustment of the width is possible by bending the two wires seen at the top of the image but it doesnt affect the tension which is the issueas such now i have music with just as much hacking and coughing and snorting and throat clearing and other mucousy soundsi had some coby headphones around the same price as these and i prefer thoes coby ones over these sadlythe coby ones i didnt have to tune my computers equalizer to make them sound right these i do and i shouldnt have to
unless this is user error i dont think i need to tune my comp to sound righthowever on a plus for these they are very comfortable to wear and they are big headphones also the bass is pretty good
after all i guess you get what you pay for
i wish i didnt have to edit the sound it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak
i had to tune the khz up pretty much and the    and  up a bit to make it sound right
the lower end just a touch for a tad more bass
other then that theres my review  starsive had the koss r headphones for more than  years and they finally need to be replaced
i use them mainly to listen to movies through my audio system
im not an audiophile but i like the sound i get out of themafter only a year or so the plastic frame that holds the ear cup cracked and broke
i put some epoxy in it and kept using it because the speakers still sounded fine
after a few more years the leatherette padding started flaking and leaving little black specks on my ears
fast forward a few more years and the smooth coating had completely flaked off leaving a comfortable fuzzy fabric
koss should have used this fabric to start with
i didnt have any more problems from them until the right speaker started cutting out a few days ago
its now time to use the lifetime warranty and get them replaced
oddly it will cost almost the same to mail them in and pay the  processing fee as it will to simply buy a new pair from amazonthese are ok sound is ok 
im not impressed at all but they work
my biggest complaint is they are lose on my head  so they must be made for a giant head
cant adjust them smaller they cover your whole ear but since they are loose can hear all the background noise so not good for a djpositives comfortablenegatives sound floods in and out and is of  walkmanera qualitysummary i wanted to support an originally milwaukeebased business but these are in every way chinese secondthoughts for the budget crowd
spend more money for something with better isolation sound and constructionits a slightly snugger fit than id like and my office is warm enough that i get warm with headphones on but they sound good and feel good when onupdate  after using them for a while and trying other headphones these sounds pretty muddy
maybe they changed over time
but for the price theyre still a pretty good dealsound quality is good very little isolation though
very comfortable to wear
construction is very poor though
broke ear cups easily
would not buy again due to poor constructionthese headphones are good for the price but nowadays you can find better oneswhy are these some of the best in the  price range
 very good sound quality especially in treble range sturdy long cable with adapter they dont break easily though theyre still made of cheap plastic theyre extremely light still that reflects on their plastic constructionthat much being said they dont stand up too well to higher priced headphones
heres why the bassmidtreble balance is off low midrange is a bit quiet the seal on the headphones is not good at all so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing the flexible design does not always align itself properly they require quite a  lot of power from portable devicesso there you have it
these are good headphones in their price range
however if youre willing to pay a bit more perhaps some  on sennheisers or sonys youll get much better bassmidtreble balance better build quality not necessarily better sound quality though and generally a better seal around your ears
also youre almost always going to get better bass with inear earbuds at this price rangestill if  is the max youre willing to pay these should do the job pretty well
just remember these are not professionalquality headphonesthe title sums it up
for whatever reason i cant get these things to sit flat on my head
the earpieces seem to fit snug at the top of my ear then lift off my face at the bottom
this prevents me from getting a good seal so i get more background noise coming in
aside from that the sound is good and for the price they perform a lot better than i expectednice headphones for the money
superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noisethe foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups
after more than  minutes of wear cups tend to go sweaty inside
it would help to have an uncoiled cord as an optioni got a pair of these to replace the hphones that came w my mp player
i was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones especilaly listening to a portable mp source
however the sound quality blew me away
the bass response is tremendous and theres absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player
its an awesome little productthe only downside is the design  in trying to retrofit the portapro to an updated behind the head fit the sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear
its best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashionon the plus side these have great rich sound
they also grip the head well so they work for exercise
on the negative side  they are seriously fuglylike people will look at you funny ugly
also the strap that goes around the back is not a strap
its steel
the length is adjustable though it can pull hair when you adjust but it is rigid and doesnt really work in the around the back position in the picture
so i ended up wearing it in the over the top of the head position which worked fine but its not what i wanted
if you dont care how they look at all and you want seriously good sound these are a good buy
otherwise id recommend you keep lookingi ami bought this unit from amazon over ayear ago and the reason was i felt the price was good and with al the tapes i make i wanted some control over the sound quality
the unit is okay but has some klitches
currently i am running my md playerrecorder and my dual cassett deck through this unit to my receiver
it allows me to do this because it will acommodate two tape decks as well i might add tv or audio visual
these are important features if you are using last years model receiver with no md input
you can really impact ont eh bass midrange and the high notes with this unit it has the goods what is difficault is that the buttons stick and as a consequence you have to manipulate them to make sure they are all the way in or all the way out
before i figured this out i thouhgt the unit was broke and put it in the garbage
i couldnt just pitch and it is a good thing because when i got an md recorder and realized i needed a way to attach it to my stereo i started playing around with the unit and discovered the stiky button problem
now i am just recording away and am pleased
like anything in this life there are ups and down points
if you have some patience and want great bass or more difined midrange or aweet highs even playing with annoying buttons makes this unit worth the pricethis camera is a quality product and takes excellent pictures especially in outdoor lighting
however at the cost i cant give it an exceptional ratingi use this camera to take action sports photos
if youre close to the action the camera does a good job
but  seems so expensive to me even if that is what the market will bearsetupinstallation of the camera wasnt perfectly smooth
the instructions werent  in line with the choices in windows  once installed camera works easily
picture is not great but clear
the  manual focus is not that meaningful
the web update and quotwatchquot  functionality work wellthis camera is incredibly easy to install it really is just plug and  play
youll need to have video conf software like netmeeting or cuseeme   the included software isnt worth installing and the drivers on win cd  are fine
wont work with windows nt unless youve installed a usb hub and  drivers especially for nt
win seems to function ok with it
rotating  focus wheel is cumbersome if youre trying to focus the camera and arent  standing right next to it
get the latest drivers from logitech com  online
the image is not crystal clear so dont expect the same quality as  you get from a digital camera but if you are looking for cost your  friends will be able to see you just fine with this one
the mounting stand  is a little wierd and the camera cable makes it shift back and forth
i  had to tie down the cable so i could position the camera and it wouldnt  move
its not worth investing in a stand for this one because of the  picture qualitythese dont stop working when i sweat which all of my other ones would do
love the handy case and the sound is good
i bought another pair i liked them so muchedited on  left earbud stopped workingive had three pair of these now going on nearly  years
the only reason ive replaced my previous two pair was because i lost them
one in a seatback on a plane
theyre quite durable
the winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures
the sound is good not great but im fine with making the trade for durability and convenience
i laid in a second set as a spare for when i eventually lose them againthese headphones have lasted  years and now the cord shield is deteriorating
these sony headphones do sound really good but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great soundthese sony monitor headphones are very good for home use which is what i purchased them for
the music i listen to works well with these nicely meditation and environmental music files also drum musicsony has a great line of products but the construction of the cords are very poor
if the cord had greater quality then these headphones would have another star in my ratingas far as my recomendation is for these well i cant make one since they only would last for five yrs
i have used them a lot but have starting using my sony earbuds more and even those seem to have poor cord constructionso because of the very poor cord construction i would now suggest another brand for headphones or earbudspros good sound for the price and nice long cord and they look nicecons they fit too tight and i couldnt adjust itreal clean highs and good clean lows
deep deep bass doesnt penetrate that loudly with these phones they still are better than everything else in their price and size rangemost suited for portable digital music  devices
some of the other quotstudioquot headphones suck up all your  portable players amperage this one needs less juice to give you louder  soundi use them with a mpfm player and have found that the mdrs  long cord makes for great fm reception even when most of its length is  folded up somweherethese headphones have a weak spot on the headband  where two peices of plastic meet
i broke it on one side ducktaped it  fixed and then broke it on the other side as well just for stuffing it  in to a jacket pocket
so dont test the plastic
it cant take  pressurebefore you get these ones look at the sony mdrlp  headphones listed in similar products
they look like great sounding  headphoneslet me begin by saying that these headphones are advertised as quotfor djsfor studio usequot  given this one would expect sony to be targeting their dj audience with these headphoneswhich they most certainly did notwhile the audio quality of these headphones is quite impressive for the price surpassing the similarly priced vs if you ask me the fact that these are designed for dj use bothers me because they lack in volume
even with both headphone amp master volume maxed on my mixer preamp i find myself struggling to hear whats happening on the channel b while channel a is playing over the speakerskick in the extra cash and get the vs which outperform these in every way possible and are much better suited for live performance use
if on the other hand you are looking for a set of headphones for home use these are a reasonable considerationim going to start with the good the sound is ok  highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit
construction is really durable i like how theres no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player
if you fall asleep with headphones on like the panasonic rphtxw that have an exposed cable above the earcup youll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it
not so with these cans
also the cable is nice thick and its coiledthe bad  its almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite
even at just  volume on my zune people across the room can hear what im listening to
this is a big reason i dont like these
if you dont care if you annoy people i guess its okthey can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions like after  min or so sometimes near the end of an album i have to take a break
the headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strongtight for an adult head
its fine for short sessionsi actually had a pair of panasonic rphtxw before these
i fell asleep in them too often and the problem i described earlier with the cable happened so i got these to replace them
i liked the panasonic rphtxw better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them
they were about the same price but they were much more comfortable and sound was better tenfoldaverage at best if you are using for djing you might want to consider another headphone unless the mixer have a preamp
i am having to put both left and right sides of headphone on to hear the cue track
hope that helpsi bought these because they were one of a few sony models that have mm drivers
my mdrcd set has been flying colors all the way so sony may as well have already had my money for these
in hindsight i should have shopped more or been willing to spend more moneyim not a dj but i selected these based on the specs for sound quality
great sound they have in abundance comfort they do not
my ears got quite uncomfortable and did so quite quickly
i had some foam padding handy so i cut some foam rings and inserted them under the covers and now i can wear them longer
they still get uncomfy after a while but its not as badmy only other con is the cord
it would have been nice if it were removable and it would be more functional to me if it were not coiled
id rather have the slack than the tensionsince i have not owned these for a long time i cant speak for the structural integrity issues that ive read about but i dont really travel with them
with any luck ill get more than a few years out of themif you dont plan to use them for long periods of time or if you have some spare foam padding lying around you might have trouble finding better sounding headphones for the price
the mm drivers make a noticeable differencethese headphones are very clean
highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion
however the low end response is not so good
at normal listening levels i would like a lot more bass response and its not there
if you crank up the volume then the bass starts coming in
but i dont listen to music that wayhope this helps in making a decision
if i had it to do over i would have bought something differenti brought these headphones for my son
he wanted a dj type headphone
i compare it to my denon ahd s
the sony sound presentation was good however i was not engaged with the music and recording like with the denon
the sony does produce an accurate sound presentation
the sound didnt have a heavy colored bass or treble neutral
the sony may not be an audiophile headphone definitely it is a great studio monitor dj headphonefirst off id like to say that these headphones are very nice quality
im not an audiophile but i do have a pair of headphones on during most of the day
playing computer games wow cod fallout etc and listening to music watching videos i prob average wearing these headphones for about  hours a day
my beef is they are not comfortable wearing beyond a  hour duration
the combination of having the ear padding too softshort and the pressure that they put on each ear i have to take them off after because of the pain they produce wearing for long periods of time
i still use them on a daily basis mostly because they were so expensive to buy in the first place i cant just set them off to the side and use something else
but after using these for a few months i might have to second hand sell them and look for something else thats more comfortable
to your average user these will be a good set of headphones but to the guy like me who wears headphones for most of the day id suggest looking for a more comfortable set of headphonesno the sony mdrv does not compare to the sony mdr model at all
in fact the v model has much more quality sounding bass much smoother sounding mid range and a higher high endin fact the sony mdr headphones are very flat sounding and i suppose they are made only for studio monitoring and recording and mastering
but i am sure the mdr are not good for either purpose
just look at the frequency response specs and they will tell you the real difference between the two of these headphones
one is for music and the other i am not sure what they are good for 
i own the mdr and they sound completely flat and dull completely lifelessthese headphones are comfortable but can get hot in the summer its pleather and not real leather
i suppose if you are real handy you can make real leather ear pads for this and sell them too online 
anyone here listening you can replace the ear pads when they wear out
but do not buy the ebay replacement ear pads they do not fit right and easily slip off
not even the same quality as the original sony ear pads
i suggest getting them from sony insteadi use to use these sony mdrv headphones for listening to all music studio mixing and for recording vocals etc
but now i prefer exclusively the jvc harx headphones instead they are the most accurate and perfect sounding headphones i have ever heard
the jvc harx blows away anything sony produces at any price the quality of the build is excellent and are more comfortable and at  the price of these sony headphonesbased on peoples descriptions i would guess that about half of these reviews were meant for the mdrv
the mdrv is the one that is comparable to the mdr not the v
if you are not familiar with the mdr line i can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers
i own the v and my brother owns the mdr and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what i can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound
the mdrv can be described as the black sheep in the family since it looks feels and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblingsthe mdrv is much bigger and bulkier than both the v and the mdr
while it uses similar drivers it has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound
most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out which drowns out the mids
this would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described
so how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me
this headphone is more like a pair of v that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads
whereas v was half metalhalf plastic the v is all plastic
on the plus side the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the vif you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors stick with the tried and true sony models such as the v or  since the late s these were among the most widely used monitor headphones in the tv and radio industryive had these headphones for a couple of years now
they sound great and are very comfortable with a silkysmooth earcup lining that means you can wear them for hoursunfortunately that same comfortable lining soon began to crack and is now flaking off in pieces about the size of a dime
the headphones still sound good are still comfortable but quite a bit of thin black plastic came off before i noticed the problem
walking around with stuff like that stuck to the side of your head is not a fashion statementis is not suninduced as i use them only indoors
i think it may be some kind of fatigue from putting them on and taking them off
so far its only happened to the right earcup
the left remains intactmaybe i just have very caustic skin oils on one side of my head
i think noti really liked these headphones soon after i bought them but now that this has happened i just cant recommend themi remember back in the summer of  i was in the muskegon michigan best buy and saw these headphones i bought them after hearing other headphones that were more expensive but went ahead and bought these because they looked durable and ive been satisfied with sonys bookshelf speakers and figured that their headphones would sound even better
they were the first pair of vs ive had
i thought the bass and vocals sounded really good but the treble was a little too thin and inaccurate in my opinion
they were still great headphones and i thought i couldnt find anything much better for the price or so it seemed back then
then a couple of months later i was on vacation in new york  and accidently left these at a hotel and was disappointed that i lost these headphones
i went until january without decent headphones and then bought another pair of sony vs in hollandmichigan but when i opened them at home i was disappointed that they werent really the same
the cord was too thin compared to my original pair that was heavy duty and thicker
i had them for about  years until i got a cat and she chewed the wire right aparti was pretty ticked off and gave up on this particular model of headphone and decided to save my money for the professional sony mdr  which i reasearced on different sites that said were  very durable and rugged headphones so i went ahead and bought those
i am a lot happier with the  not just for their durability and thick cord but i also thought and still think they sound twice as good as the vs the treble sounds a lot better on the s for about  to   more and are a better pairi keep a better eye on my cat and she hasnt even messed with my cords anymorethe vs are decent headphones but the thin cord makes it so i just cant recommend them to anyone who owns a pet or little kidsgood overall headphones for the cost sold here and for first foray into a better sound from the standard issuefor the price they have a better than usual articulation in the sound buti bought them at a mall  to get me through a quick need situation and i expected a little more from sony
ive had many other cheap  high end cans as well thus seeing both sides of the spectrum for my moneyprice wise these sony mdr vs are pretty decent for someone wanting a quiet closedear headphone for not too much money  or so
like all cans they will sound better after you break them in about hrs
or soive usedtried these on both my desktop computer taking out the speaker jack  plugging these in after unscrewing the  jack supplied  on my high end stereo systempros fit snuggly adjust well not too heavy they work well for large cans and loud on a fairlow amount of energy decent amount of presence and spacial deffiniton they have clear sound that wont show the immperfections of some recordings a nice touch one cord feeds both earsspeakers on the left side design style folds up small for its overall size
nice lengthdesign to the cordcons a weak bass response that becomes muddled if pushed loud at all
mid range response is loud yet sounds flat
and highs that sound clipped and not really distinct
these comments may be a little harsh for the price range but im trying to steer you towards somthing better if you are willing to spend a little moreanyone really wanting to dramatically improve their lisenting experience and usingneeding headphones on a regualr basis should spend a little more money and buy any sennheiser or a grado product
for the money these are excellent headphone alternatives for whatever additional amount more than this your willing to payall in all not a bad product solid good plastic construction in design not a stand out in sound eitherand for the money seemingly average
my advice is to spend a bit more and get somthing that you will really notice the difference in and say wow
than you will have somthing that will last you for years to comemdrv mdr mdrv mdrexsl i own all of these headphones and i have to say that my  year old pair of sony mdrvs and especially my newer mdrs blow these mdrvs out of the water
while arguably a bit more comfortable for long sessions the mdrvs sound thin and cold compared to the mdrs
i gave my mdrvs away because i was even more disappointed with them once i bought the mdrs
kids save your milk money for another week or two and buy some cans that are audiophile quality  the mdrs
i have had mine for  years or so and just recently replaced the earpads with beyerdynamic velour pads and man oh man  the sound gets even better and the cans just got waaay more comfortable
buyer take note  do some reading on the can web sites and steer yourself towards a better sony product than the mediocre mdrvs
your ears will thank you and youll thank amazoncom for getting the mdrs to you in record time
note if you need something lighter and portable and it has to be sony try the mdrexsls  they sound decent but theyve had cord quality issuesok for the price and i like the design and fit so i keep buying them but they break down quickly
ive been through severalquality of headset is good
does not have standard  jack plug as adverstised
would suggest only as replacement for other plantronic product and not cross usageit broke before  months of light use however plantronics replaced it for just the cost of firstclass postage to return the broken unit after receiving the prompt replacement
just google plantronics quick web service form without the quotes and fill out the formthere seems to be some conflicting information about using this headset with the iphone among the existing reviews
for the record the jack on this headset is not the right size for use with the iphone i replaced  of these and then finally bought a dect  phone system and a dedicated all in one vs a cord like this
cord and connection is a weak spotthis headset works fine but i expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
also have not been able to get it to work with my samsung galaxy im guess that was an issue with the  to  mm plug adapter i got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone
not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone however which is what i am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poori spent many hours searching for a good headset for my clarity xlc  cordless phone for the hearing impaired and settled on this one as the most bang for the buck
i was hoping for a headset to improve my hearing even with this phone which it did but only marginally so
it is convenient not to hold the phone to speak into it
the best about this headset is its very low price of  through the oem shop
for that low price what can one really expect
i did note many similar offerings for this headset from other suppliers ranging to several times what i paid
at any rate the image depicts two ear hooks i received only one size which seems too large to be useful
i received with the package a short adapter cable to convert the headsets connector from  mm to the necessary mm for my phone
the assembly is a bit clumsy when connected to my phone
the ear cushion is rather small the image shows two
the entire headset construction is a bit fragile and i dont expect it to last very long so treat the unit with kid gloves
no instructions were supplied to convert to the ear hook and i hesitate to try to adapt fearing to break the plasticsperhaps my ears have been sullied by augmented headphones in the past but these particularly phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others
im not talking about a lack of thumping bass thats fine by me
but rather well its hard to describe
no warmth
no resonance
just sterilei suppose thisd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work but when im trying to enjoy folk tunes classic jazz orchestral music its just dishearteningi purchased this pair of headphone around four years ago
i used it from time to time  much less lately
at the very beginning i first ran it for at least a hundred hours  leaving it plug to a cd player or pc and keep playing a few different kinds of music
i found the headphone reproducing high frequencies and low frequencies quite good
however it lacks midranging resulting that the music reproduced felt a bit thin and not warm enough but not harsh
i mostly listen to classical music easy listening jazzy vocal instrumental etc but no hard rockalso its not comfortable for wearing long times  more than  mins  youll feel too warm to your ears also the headphone is a bit heavyi truly and honestly dont get the rave reviews
im no super audiophile but i have a decent surround sound system appreciate good sound and deep bass
i love hearing fine details in wellrecorded and mastered music like a guitar strum
and i swear  inear phones of just about any random brand have better richer sound than these
i tried them in my surround system tried them in my iphone ipad imac pc and everywhere it sounded like i had two underpowered muddy tin cansi guess i must be crazy because everyone else seems to love these
i returned and got cheaper inear phones because the sound is much much betterthe headphones sound fine they are comfortable enough  but this cord is  a dealbreaker
as other reviewers have noted it is very heavy due to its substantial coiling  and as a result it will not comfortably rest on any surface yet cannot be left dangling because it is too heavy
maybe an example would suffice if i plug these into my mac tower while sitting at my desk the cord is too short to not start engaging the coils  which produces tension and then tugs on the headphones  eventually causing the plug to pop out of the computer
annoying
whats worse is that the cord refuses to rest on he desk either without sliding off because once again it is too short and the coils are too heavy
i have to secure it down which is harder than it might seem without duct tape plus it really restricts my movementfor this alone i would recommend another setthese are well made headphones and have excellent response in the mid to high end frequencies but come up just a little short in the deep bass response
i did try them with several different sources
i listen to pretty much everything  classic counrty folk rock you name it not much on rap or techno 
compared to my harmon kardon and pioneer speakers  or even cheap skull candy earbuds these headphones just didnt cut it for bassi was really hoping that these would provide superflat sound reproduction
i was pretty disappointed when i plugged them in for the first time
i got a second opinion from my brother and he didnt have anything nice to say about them eitherthey have a particular warm sound that some people may appreciate but its like have a builtin eq on the headphones that you can never change
i personally like flatsounding speakers eg
bw and i like denon receivers for this reason and in this category the vs dont perform well at allanother problem i am picky about comfort
these headphones were not comfortable for me at all
i could wear them for about  hour before i absolutely had to take them offi am picky about my headphones so i gave these to my friend and im still on the prowl for a better set
i have since listened to the vs and i prefer the vs to these although im still not sure if i will settle on the vsone more thought and anybody saying that these have no bass is out of their mindi did very well this past christmas season
i added thesennheiser hdand sony mdrv to my collection of headphones
i intended to keep both because i was going to use them differently
i got the sennheiser hd mainly for movies and the mdrv for music
unfortunately i had to send one of them backpros high quality build folds compactly fairly comfortable out of this world frequency range nice bass love the coiled cord includes carry pouchcons highs were harsh for mefirst off i burned in both sets of headphones for about  straight days
i then spent about  hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources
my intention wasnt to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphonesright away i noticed that the bass response on the mdrv was much better
listening to rap techno trance and synthpop was much more fun on the mdrv than on the hd
after a couple of hours i started to notice i was turning the volume down on the mdrv because it was causing discomfort
however i realized that it wasnt the volume but that the highs in some of the music i was listening to were just harsh
too harsh
the mdrv is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately but the tradeoff is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to
red hot chili peppers just killed me
if i hadnt been comparing them to the hd i may not have noticed it
i think i am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies
i was disappointed to have to send them back
by the way my source material were lame vbr encoded mps some flac encoded music files and dvd movieson the flip side i felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable
the pressure was not nearly as intense as thesennheiser hd pro
the coiled cord compact folding carry pouch and durability were all things i found to be very positivei am not saying that the sony mdrv will be harsh for everyone
i believe i actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me
but if you get them and feel your ear drums ache you may be experiencing the same issue i did
a vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them
in fact i recommend everyone at least try them
they are an amazing deal on amazon for legendary cansi use this to listen to music on my mp player at work
the sound is good but after about an hour my ears begin to hurt and i have to take it offdid research on headphones and have a few friends who are audiophiles djs gamer audiophiles and musicians
about this reviewers references been listening to music since  have had my share of ear accessories  aiwa sony koss sennhieser random studio recording headphones no idea what they were and would say these mdrvs are good but not great sound clarity is definitely its strength
everyone is going to have a personal opinion and mine is that these cans can be listened to for hours
im shocked to have read that folks thought these were too bassy
im on the other side of the fence
i think however im all for basslines woven in with highs  i suggest if anyone wants to test these cans should try their test on various media to get more out of their experience with these headphones
so far they really can tell a poor mp over a larger audio file on itunes
these are going to be used for personal enjoyment not for a professional studio
i may try these cans on my dj friends equipment but really dont want to take them anywhere but home yet these are transportableabout the comfort my ears are small they are about  inches in height and  in width and fit right into the ear cushions
perfect
i cant hear a thing outside nor inside my room
they do get a little warm but not an uncomfortable type of heat more like these things are growing on your head
snug fit definitely still newdurability yes these are questions i wouldve liked to have known before purchasing headphones
i was hoping that the two elbows that hold the cans themselves would be solid steel or metal to my dismay they are those plastic break this and you got to buy a new one elbows
i wouldnt mind finding a good pair of headphones that had a metal elbow that would hold them that is usually where they breakor get the wire pulled
hey there is an idea for a headphone maker
headphones that last but would probably be less business for them theyd have my money and my friends
yes so just like many headphones if you sit on these flush you will probably break that part of the headphone havent tried it yet though and not wanting toin the end i am quite pleased with these headphones  i guess the only coupe de grace would be durabilitybass
i would still like to test these headphones on dj equipment and other formats
just picked up some problems on the selling point of these headphones given the impedance rating on these phones they should sound good on my itunes   was listening to deadmau with the track strobe and the highs start to crack and pop now im starting to get a better feel for these headphones
they sound good for rock sound tested van halen   i guess for the price you get something good not amazing
listening now and not getting that tingly feeling you get when youre embraced by the mids touched by the highs and rocked by the bassi think these are good for an overall good experience nothing mindbody alteringi have a lot of headphones
and have had for many years
i have these and love them
these are closedear clinical precise sounding cans
they are hot on your ears
they are harsh
they are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences
when youre mixing music you need to listen on a variety of sources sources you expect your music to be heard on ipod earbuds car stereos am radios disco sound systems etc
these are great because they relentlessly show detail
if your mix sounds good on these things itll sound good on anything
but if you are looking for a comfortable moving listening experience check out grado
audiophile quality rich and beautiful
recordings mixed with these sonys will sound spectacular on grados
these are an incredible tool but they are built for a purpose and its work not pleasureprogreat sound
fairly effective sound isolation
well builtconsi dont find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear they are tight on my head my ears are bigger than the hole so they kind of pinchit might be that after a while theyll stretch out or relax to my head and they will become more comfortablethere has been a degeneration of sony products
these headphones are cheaply made wiring is not concealed and are not as comfortable and well made as my sony mdrv headphones that are more than  years old
fortunately sony still sells replacement earphone covers for the good headphones that it formerly madei got these headphones and was extremely pleased with them
i did a lot of research before purchasing these
before continuing some notessony is no longer manufacturing this product
these headphones were designed in  and sony attempted to cancel the manufacturing of this product years ago but upon popular request were forced to remake the product
they then cancelled them again and are no longer on the sony sitethere are really wellmade replicas afoot
if you purchase this product verify that they are a sony authorized retaileryou need a powerful audio source to get good sound out of them
do not plan to hook these up to your handheld device and be pleasedokay now my review
this is an overall very comfortable headphone
the weight is good and they feel like a very wellbuilt product
i returned them due to their lack of power
after listening to the  from the same source i realized just how weak these aredont google mdrv vs mdr you will spiral into a neverending debate between people who are simply loyal to the original product v vs people who say they are the same exact thing
they are not the same thingsome claim the magnets in the  are stronger to which i cannot testify
the only thing i can say with certainty is that i heard subtleties from the  that i did not hear with the vaudio quality of the vlow mids are strong while the high mids are not crisp
midlows sound quiet while the really deep bass sounds as it should but not strong
highs sound strong throughoutsave your time and money and get the  if you are debating between the very rich sound for the price
have owned this product for several years and the sound is spot on but the earpads flaked badly and fall off repeatedly which is a pain in the ass to deal with
see many similar complaintsthese headphones have great sound are super comfortable and do a great job blocking out outside sound
they could probably stand to have the styling upgraded though as they look a little out of date compared to newer designs update  although i am still very happy with the sound of these headphones
i am going to take off two stars because my earpads already wore out
ive had these less than a year and use them very very lightly
although there are many replacement options available wearing out in less than a year with the light use only that ive put on them is inexcusable
now im going to have to try and figure out sonys warranty service not something im looking forward to
on the plus side ive found these to be very good for the airplane  they really do block out a lot of outside noisei paid upper s on sale a couple of months ago
i think its  to  less now
theyre worth  so if theyve dropped in price then theyre definitely worth it
sound is good for digital stereo but wont compare to a surround sound headphone
if all you need is stereo you wont be disappointedthey feel overly delicate and the sound quality is just ok in my opinion
also the coiled cord is curiously heavy and the connector seems like it isnt seating properly as the left channel constantly produces a lot of crackling if you nudge the connector or pull on the cord at all
never had that problem before
sound and build quality of the audio technica athm is certainly worth the extra cost
they are reasonably comfortable but every time i pull them out i feel like im going to accidentally destroy them as i fidget with getting the ear cups out from their folded positioneveryones hearing is different so this is not really a critical reviewi guess you really have to try headphones first much like speakersthis is one disadvantage with mailorder products but amazon is great with returnsawesome sound super clear and crisp
but alsosomehownot enough bass for me
somehow too accurate for me i want more somehowi have been using these headphones for only a few days
i can tell you that these headphones do sound great but for some reason require me to turn the volume really high to get sound out of them
this might just be how monitor headphones are though
but i wouldnt really know
now on to the review
i plugged these into my bose companion speakers and had to turn the volume more than halfway to get the normal amount of sound that i usually get from a regular pair of headphones
now i know what you are thinking
this guy must be deaf if he has turn the volume that loud to hear something
but thats just not the case
now i tried watching videos on youtube and listening to music on the computer and the volume was really low on them with volume turned up halfway on my bose companion speakers
i also plugged these into to my sony walkman x series to test the sound quality
i had to turn the volume all the way up to  to get surround sound
now with the ex earbuds that came bundled with my walkman i only need to turn the volume up to  or  to get the same surround sound
note that the volume limit on my walkman is only  so for me to have turn the volume up to  with the sony mdrv its already passed the avs limit which is the safe volume for listening to music
like other reviews have stated before the headphones are extremely sensitive
this was especially noticeable to me when the volume on my walkman was  or below
the sound from the left and right side of the earpads would keep changing when i was walking around with it especially when the coil came in contact with something else
i was able to solve this problem though by turning the volume up to  on my walkman
the headphones them self are really light weight and comfortable to wear
the headphone cord itself is heavier than the pair of headphones
i would recommend these headphones if you were to just sit in one place and listen to them
but not if you are constantly moving around with themi got these about a year or so ago
they sound good and are comfortable but after a year the covers on the ear piece are falling apart and are not cheap to replacethis is great headphone for treble lover its midrange is adequate but the bass is very minimal
i hear sounds that require good speakers to deliver on this headset the treble is very clear human voice is beautifully reproduced on thx movies the imaging is very impressive  however there is very little bass in it
it rated as  hz to mhz i dont know how sony comes up with the low frequency rating that is lower than most  sub woofer can deliver
i doubt it can go lower than  hz and you have to look for it
this headphone has the characteristic of electrostatic speakers clear treble and lack of full audio body  it is suitable for light jazz or the like but not much elsewherei had two pairs of these headphones that both broke in a few months
i dont get why the cord looks so very heavyduty when the part you work with the most is so brittlea nice camera
since the other reviews list all positives letme list the downsides of picking this otherwisecool cameraup
does not include an ac adapter
the hp adapter costs a fortune 
buy a cheaper sony v ma adapter as another reviewer notesitll do the same thing for about 
get nimh batteries and a charger target carries these otherwise youll soon begin to hate this machine especially if you download pics to your pc a lot
this one includes no carrying case
consider the pdc  instead
this camera is a good quality hp one but has a cheap plastic look to it
alternatives in the same  range include the kodak dc for about the following was a consequence to reckon with then came the digital agesony cfsw had the best internal microphone of any boom box and too bad i once damaged the record sides tape door with a koosh ball a dozen years ago soon got rid of it but never forgot how great sonys level of quality was for  at the local acme store back then
unfortunately today it is probably scarce as hens teeth in the hope in finding one if you are a fan of vintage recording equipmentlets talk about the tcm
its microphone is as sensitive as the boom box mentioned above and it erases and records just as well on high bias and normal bias tape
the boom box had a silvercoated magnet erase head whereas the shoebox tcm has a black magnet erase head
the story about identifying erase heads capabilities is unique and personal
here are the pluses and minuses and read my review on the tcmpros tape counter hypersensitive internal microphone try external microphone for cleaner sound erases and records almost equally on normal bias and high bias battery life nearly as long on nimh batteries as on alkaline duracell or energizer well built runs on included household adapter sound quality unaffected unlike the tcm great price for its features  at the local best buy back in the daycons would be more efficient but maybe slightly more bulky on  c batteries instead of  aa severe dc bias effect distorted s and t sound do we know records below optimum on metal bias partial erasure over previous recording scratchy sound through speaker especially after several years of use a common problem with units of this leaguethis recorder wont fit in your pocket but has a retractable handle making it easier to carry
i would recommend this recorder especially since i have owned it twice the first one broken by experimentation in  and the second one i still use regularly have had since well i got this with my camera dscp and i have to say its pretty weak
for low resolution pictures vga and low resolution videos  no this memory stick is the perfect buy
but if you like your pictures and videos high quality and full screen dont even think about buy this memory stick
on low setting pictures vga you get i think  pictures and on low setting videos  i think you get about  and a half minutes
however on medium setting pics  you get only  pics and on medium setting video  standard you only get  seconds to be exact
you should be saying that is ridiculous
but for people who dont really care much about quality or resolution this is a perfect buy for you though if you like mediumhigh quality and high resolution pics and vids i recommend the mb memory stick sdmsvnothing outstanding about this that separates it from any generic cable you can buy  i was just in a hurry to get something and this was at the top of the listproduct worked well for my needs
the price i paid was very good compared to a retail store
shipping was on time
packaged very well
good by for the moneyi bought this so that i could use my webcam a little farther from the computer but it doesnt work
i see warnings that  feet is the limit for usb cables and with the webcam cable it comes to a total of  so i guess im on the cusp or something ah well theyre cheap enough that ill just save it and maybe i can use it some other way not worth returning
no complaints at all about the seller mind youwas using this for my printer to hook up to my laptop worked fine for awhile but for some reason it stopped working
my laptop does not recognize printer when i use this
i am getting a different one arriving tomorrow hope it lasts longerim surprised because i like belkin productsits a good extension from a good brand and you cant beat the price
why is limited to  we may never know great for ps controllers and whatnot
be sure you dont need it for anything that requires speed external drive etc or youll be waiting for a while
at first i thought it was from the s or something but it does say  on the packaging
in what universe do they still make usb  speed accessories in 
for that you get three of emthis works for the practical things such as printers and keyboards
however if you need to connect something that is data heavy and requires the use of usb  such as an external hard drive or a hd camera you need to look elsewherethat being said the high price disappoints me for such old technology
although it overall depends on what you need it forive had this for a while
i use it so that i can use my phone or tablet in bed while charging
eventually it stopped charging them as well
its inconsistent
good price but i would like a more reliable cablemaybe this camera is too dated
its quite large it can barely be called a compact camera
also the maximum aperture is a mere f so its a good idea to use highspeed filmon the other hand the picture quality is excellent with slrtype quality
genuinely much better than the results i can get from a similarlysized digital camera especially at the shorter end of the zoom
and the flash does a pretty good job
theres some redeye but in general it doesnt overlight scenes the way most flashes do on small camerasi had this camera for a number of years and my friend still uses it
over the years its developed a few problems it makes a grinding sound as the zoom extends it hasnt broken yet but i expect it will someday and it can be a little tricky to open the door enough to activate the cameramaybe the stillinproduction stylus epic  lens is a better choice  theres no zoom but it has a faster lens a smaller body and slightly better picture qualityi bought one of these radios about  or  years ago primarily to use while traveling and at the ball park
it proved to be a good radio for traveling and an adequate radio for use at the ball park
in the ball park reception was bad in certain areas and in other areas the radio had to be turned to tune in the station
since i live in an area by the sea the battery terminals get corroded faster than normal and apparently something inside got corroded as well since operation now unreliablethe compact size is great
the autooff timer is rather annoying since the factory setting can not be changed and to make it through a ball game the radio must be turned back on a couple of times
i found the supplied ear buds to be uncomfortable but used them anyway  the jack is smaller than normalbottom line  the radio worked good enough that i am now ordering another one from amazon at a savings of more than  when compared to what i paid for the orginal onethe dtv for about  less performs better lacking only the dtvws weather bandthe vw is a little smaller and lighter
both are small enough for a shirt pocket perhaps with a bit of sagthe  weather band doesnt work very well getting the same station on every  channel on my dtvwthe dtv can be operated in the dark this is  impossible with the complex operation of the dtvwthe performance  difference is most noticeable on the am band where the dtv does  remarkably well in distance receptionthe dtvw uses aaa batteries  instead of aa and has a unusual subminiature jack on the earphone jacks  requiring an adapter included to use any other earphonesum i wish i hadnt bought this radioit is larger than expected
it is too big for the pocket
well it would fit but then the lock would have to be used so the buttons didnt get pushed and then the stations cannot be changedif you want a clip you have to put the radio into this cheesy plastic thing that has a clip
it looks super cheap and not what was expected for a sangean
that clip was a hassle to use so it was gone in a minutei bought this radio hoping for one that was more convenient to wear at the desk and walking around and on walks without thinking about the radioconsit takes two button pushes to change the station to your next preset
what
i thought it would be smaller than it is so read the dimensions closelyno built in clipi have two other sangean radios that i love
oh wellthis is a nice little radio  compact gets very good reception for me has good bass response and is quite light
it fits easily in a shirt pocketof course the ear buds that came with it are trash
but thats the same with every audio device you buy  shouldnt be a real shocker to anyone in this day and age of mp players ipods personal devices etc that youre paying for the device not the ear buds
just realize that going in and buy yourself a decent set of earphones or earbuds at the same time you buy the unitmy major complaint is how the favorite station settings work
setting up your favorites is easy enough but to listen to them you have to click a recall button then rapidly tune up or down to get to whichever station you want and click recall again before it resets to normal tuning mode
if you want to go to another favorite station you again have to click recall but this time instead of starting on the station you were last on it goes to the bottom of the list so you again have to scroll all the way through your favorites
i like it much better on their other radios  like the sangean dtw where you just click a favorites button and you can then scroll at will and when you turn the power off and on again the station is what you left it with last
this constant business of hitting the recall button then repeatedly scrolling through your list hitting the recall button again is quite annoyingwhat otherwise would be a  star rating gets  stars knocked off as a resultthis is a basic amfm clock radio if thats what you need it looks nice sounds nice and works however if you need single sideband you need to look at the ats this is a good little radio good reception good tone good controls
its only weak point is its size though too big for a beach robe pocket too small to stand up on its own on a beach towel
but otherwise im as happy as a clam in the offseason with ithi folks its vince the radioman 
i have a large selection of radios and love to do compares and share my thoughts
this radio is good for the casual listener who doesnt want to spend a lot of money but would like to hear some sw along with amfm 
the fm section is the best part of this radio the am section is filled with images and noise for the dxers out there 
for local am its pretty goodthe built in sound and sound slection modes are surpisingly good
the overall construction and quality is fair at best and the radio is a battery hog 
the sw section is fair
if you want to hear the big broadcasters  ok  anything else is static
there is no fine tuning 
the yb and the eton e  are far better for tuner sensativity and battery lifeits not a bad radio but others are better
how about  and half starsthis radio was a disapointment
i live  miles outside of chicago so im not in one of  the most challenging areas such as in the loop or in downtown ny
the fm band could only reach the very strongest stations and not the weaker ones as id hoped
i guess it comes down to this that you get what you pay for
this inexpensive radio was unremarkable as matter of fact i actually couldnt receive that many shortwave stations eitheri bought this radio as a replacement for the kaito ka which inexplicably stopped working in the ammw band and gave me concerns about kaitos quality controlthis is a basic shortwavefmam radio large enough to provide decent roomfilling sound yet small and light enough to fit into a backpack
as i am going on a trip to asia and will be going to places where shortwave radios are banned its also cheap enough to leave behind somewherethere arent many bells and whistles on this model no exact frequency readout no sleep timer no alarm no presets no wide or narrow filter no treble and bass settings no external antenna jack no tuning outside the basic fmam and shortwave broadcast bands not even a carrying case
it has a headphone jack and input for ac outlet and thats about iti compared it to my sony icfgr and found the sensitivity to be about equal
i was able to tune into the usual shortwave powerhouses china radio international radio bulgaria radio havana cuba radio canada international and voa africa service without much effort
the sony obviously provides better selectability though the sangean had far more interference from adjacent stations
this sangean like all analogue models also suffered from frequency drift and had to be retuned from time to timebuild quality is fair
its light enough not to add much additional weight to my backpack but as others have noted the knobs are flimsy
speaker quality is good
its not too tinny soundingif youre looking for a cheap small light travel radio or a backup radio for emergencies this is the radio for you
if youre interested in shortwave dxing viz listening to long distance stations as a hobby this radio may be too limiting and frustrating
if you intend to give this radio heavy or rough usage it may not lastif youre serious about shortwave this isnt the radio you want but this radio is great as a quotdo iwanttopursuethisshortwavethingfurtherquot radio or as a  lightweight travel rig
itll will bring in the higherpower shortwave  stations  bbc radio netherlands radio japan etc
sound quality is quite  good
like most analog radios knowing what frequency you are on is  impossible but for casual tuning or to get a taste of what shortwave has  to offer this radio is fine
its also small and light enough to make a  decent travel portable and cheap enough that if you lose it its not the  end of the world
and its a good radio to toss into your emergency  preparedness kitit will perform better with an external antenna  quotboostquot  just take a  piece of wire attach a couple of  alligator clips and save yourself  by not buying a quotreel inquot  antennanice starter radio for sw lots of freq to tune live near the beach and the many stationcome in ok  not great ok  hey its a nice starter radio also bought the fr now thats greata fellow reviewer named mary l stein talk show junkie writes despite the advertising there is no am band on this radio
this is quite untrue
this radio has am band it is however labeled as mw as opposed to being labeled am
mw stands for medium wave and is just another name for am which stands for amplitude modulation
although labeled differently it is quite obvious once one uses this radio that mw are the am stationsi wasnt able to get any of the major shortwave channels like voice of america and radio europe and bbc but the fmband works pretty goodjust okay in my opinion i got this radio to be able to listen to npr and bbc news at home
reception in my home in santa fe new mexico is just okay not great pretty fuzzy most of the time
a little disappointing but since it was inexpensive no great loss
maybe it will work better in other placesthis is a very good radio for folks just entering the world of shortwave listening 
the radio has a very good sound from the built in speaker and the tuner on amfm and sw seem to be pretty good 
i have compared this radio to the popular sony sw which is sonys analog mulitband equivalent the sangean has much better sound and about the same level of selectivity from the tuner 
the sangean is also about  cheaper 
my only knock on this radio is that even though the tried to keep the price down a telescoping antenna would have been nice 
other than that no real complaints 
a very good buy this is a decent radio
it sounds good and has a plethora oftuning features
but it is expensive and offers only mediocreperformance for the moneyfor a bunch less cash you can have a more sensitive moreportable radio the sony swgr
while it doesnt soundas nice as the sangean it will pull in many more signalshas better ssb performance plus has synchronous detectionwhich locks in signals and reduces noise and interferenceamazons price on the sony is almost  us less than thesangean
the sony is the absolute best value in this classof receiveri own a sony icf grundig yb and just purchased the ats
of the three i would give the ats the lowest score
it definitely lacks the sensitivity of the other two
though connecting an external antenna helps greatly but defeats the purpose of a portable radio
and i find the audio quality to be muddled and tiring to listen toif youre looking for a good portable i would also recommend the grundig yb or the new sony icfgrfirst a disclaimer i own the ccrane super  and not the standard uniti use this radio far more than any radio i own
i have an office  thats partially below ground and a very difficult am reception area
i telecommute a lot and i listen to talk radio while i work and this radio gets me through the dayone neat feature is the variable sensitivity knob on the left side of the radio lets me turn the sensitivity down and rotate the radio in order to determine the exact direction a weak am signal is coming from
this way i can position the radio for optimum reception
once in position i turn the sensitivity back up againheres one thing you might not have read about this radio in any other review its a great help with ebaythats right those three separate timers on this unit combined the  military  hour clock allow me to look right at an auction end time which is in  hour format punch in a time about five minutes before that and let the radio tell me when to get in front of my computer and get ready to win that auction
and i can set up to three different timers at the same time
you dont need the super version to enjoy this feature
yes i know thats probably not what the designers of this radio had in mind
the downside is that the one thing this radio is supposed to excel in especially the super version it simply doesnt at least not for mei once ran a simple wire out of a cheap analogue sw portable down here in the basement and got a lot of sw stations from overseas like japan and tiawan but this radio cant pick up what that cheap radio could in the very same location and with a better antenna setup
i dont get italso the volume is broken or somehow doesnt work in such a way as to allow me to turn the volume down very quiet
i actually have to run the volume a bit louder than i want because i cant turn it down
im way too much of a cheapskate to pay to get this fixedfinally i actually bought this slightly used but practically new it was pristine so i didnt pay full price
if i had and i was a real sw enthusiast i would probably have been disappointedso three stars because from my expreience it does not excel at what is supposed to be its specialty and ive got the hot rodded version and its a rather expensive radio
personally i love it but im only using a fraction of the functionality that people typically buy a radio like this fori am kind of collector of shortwave portable radios
when i read about the  it seemed to me like the definitive portable i dont like the other definitive sony 
so i bought it from amazon good price and  reliable store and as soon as it was delivered to me i benchmarked it  against the first radio i got on hand a modest fifteen years old phillips  compass
well to my surprise the phillips showed twice as sensitive as  the sangean
even with the sangeans whip full extended and the phillips  one totally folded the phillips clearly outperformed the  when  switched to an external antenna the sangean improved  but the point  is what a portable means
why such a good radio performs so poor with such  a long whip antenna
if you need the receiver to carry it around while  travelling then check the sony g or grundig ybpe both with  superior performance as portable
otherwise with an ext
antenna the  radio is an excellent allkindoffeatures receiver
the fm capture is  superb as well as the ssb legibility
the sound is quite good even if not  as good as the grundigsthis thing is just a hunk of wire
it works just like any other piece of wire
it just is on a spool that lets you wind it back in
nothing magic herei tried my sangean ant portable short wave antenna with my sangean  i did not notice any significant improvement with reception but then again at the time i am living in a rather large city mexico city the biggest in the worldi took my little radio and antenna on a recent vacation to the us virgin islands and attempted to pick up some radio stations from the french caribbean with the built in whip antenna
i had some luck but when i connected the ant i had some improved reception i was very happy with the resulti recommend this antenna for noncrowded radio environmentthe objective of adding the sangean ant to the plbt was to improve reception relative to the radios native reception capability
the sangean ant does not make a substantial difference in this radios reception
that said there may be no fault with the sangean antenna and criticism may not be warranted it may be the telescoping antenna included with the plbt is just that good
the sangean ant does connect and work as advertised
there is no complaint on quality of build or ease of usethis is indeed an oem drive  came with no warranty card no sata cable screws shipping list manual or any other insert
if this drive goes south i dont have much of a paper trail to help me send it back
purchased from tech for less through amazon
i guess they ran out of them because the seller is now some other outfitthis was purchased for an office
for some reason i cannot format the drive from windows i need to use the seagate program i downloaded from seagates site
this doesnt make the drive a bad drive i just do not feel as comfortable with it as i do others i have purchased that windows will format
the awkward install and setup is the only reason for the lower scoreit worked fine for charging camera batteries etc
when it was used with a hair dryer it went up in smoke
if you are planning on using it for light duty it should do just fine but dont plan on running heavier loads through iti took this thing to tokyo
it was basically a waste of space
im not sure if it was the voltage in tokyo or if i just got a busted piece of equipment
it would charge my phone with it but it would only last a few minutes so i just plugged it straight into the wall and it worked even betteri ended up mistakenly ordering this instead of a gigabit switch
mostly my fault but not what i wanted
oopsa perfect good ethernet switch but i didnt see the it is only  mbps
so it is the bottleneck in my network
i now use it as an extra switch if i need additional temporary connections
it states every port supports up to  mbps in dedicated bandwidth but i could verify thispros very reliable small footprintcons only for  mbps networks no indicator light on front non cable side since this is not rack mounted rubber feet tend to fall offthis switch is basic and it works just fine it is a great value for the price that i paiddont know what to say
it does what it claims to do
doesnt toast my grill cheese sandwiches or change my oil but does add ethernet portssssneeded some additional ports from an outlet and it solved the issue with no wiring
works great right out of the boxi purchased this switch originally for my home
back when xbox s came without a wireless card for shame microsoft
 i needed a switch to run my tiny home network of a pc laptop ps and xbox the switch works as advertised great for home networks where you receive a residential internet connection lt  mbs
however if youre going to hook up a couple computers at school or work you can get more out of a  switch instead for a slightly higher investment
the major downside to trying to network with a switch directly from your isp is that sometimes it can be complicated to assign ip addresses and dns manually on an xbox  or ps
a router will automatically assign ip addresses but a switch is an unintelligent device  it just passes the signal throughmake sure that youre getting the right product for your network
if this is it it wont fail youproscheap effective switch for most usershandy to have in any network techs baggood value when it works which is most of the timeamazons most excellent return policy consdoes not work with every network device
in my case it worked with every pc and net device in my house except my desktop pc which it would not link withnetgears tech support is less useful than breasts on a boar hows the weather in india today
i could not get the phone support dude past the problem must be with your pc but my pc works with everything except your switchproblems like this suggest loose component tolerances that result in timing errors preventing a link between devicesother thoughtsreplaced withcisco sf d  port desktop  switch which was  cheaper has a metal box the same size and best of all is a cisco producti have used netgear products in the past and will in the future but this one was a dud and if anything goes wrong just rma and skip the phone supportthis is advertised as a five port switch
however one of the ports is used to connect to the modem
as a result you are left with only four usable ports
i had another product previously that i replaced after three years
it was a five port switch but it had another port to connect the modem so it had five usable ports
this is what i thought i was buying based on the description
the device works fine and is a good product
if you need all five ports you should get another productit works i was able to hook up my xbox and pc to this and worked but the speed was a major diffrence i have fiber optics and i constantly test my connection speed when i run without this switch i get down  upload but when i have the switch on i get  down and upload it just lowers my down speed horribly which is very disappointing if i cant find a way to fix it ima give up on netgear products i always have issuesthe keyboard is adequate
i like the feel of it and the positioning of the hands
however i have one rather large complaint to make when typing certain words namely those that end in quotncequot the letter u mysteriously appears at the end of it
i have tested my theory with numerous words and they all seem to end with a u even though it wasnt typed
this appears to happen when im typing at a fast pace
i am going to see if this is just a defect and see if i can get another one
otherwise just a mixed positivenegative reviewive had this keyboard for about  years now
i have the dell verision dell by microsoft which i think is the same as the original microsoft onebut just has dell branded on the right corner
it is a good sturdy keyboard however it is very loud
the other keyboards i have  of them are not half as loud as this one
i just bought a new microsoft erognomic keyboard for my wife and it is very nice quietafter using this keyboard for several months i have concluded that while it works pretty much as promised sometimes a company can take an uncomplicated product like a keyboard and goose it up so much that it becomes too complicated for its purpose
that is the case with this product
my keyboard rests in a drawer and the buttons at the top of the b keyboard sometimes hit the top of the drawer starting my email program etc
plus i could never get the  usb ports to work properly
finally i dont type any faster on the quotnaturalquot keyboard and when friends and relatives use it they complain bitterly
i should have stuck with a simple keyboard with all of these bells and whistles
my mistake
not microsofts
but think about this before you buy this productthe keyboard itself is fine
i like the feel of the keys
the programmable keys are pretty good itd be nice if more than a few were customizable
my biggest complaint  and its a big one  is that ive found the intellitype software which allows you to program the keys to be a cause of keyboard system errors hello blue screen
its done this multiple times on my dell winme system to the point where i had to get rid of intellitype for good the piece of junk  this was the winme version 
i just use the keyboard without the programmable features and i like it
however if i were doing it again id get a cheaper nonprogrammable model and save money
get whatever keyboard has the most comfortable keys for you  microsoft has competitors too
i know this intellitype isnt going anywhere near my system againa good one of these can last  years
a bad one doesnt last  weeks
either way getting the whole fixture and chucking everything bar the sensor saves  over buying just the sensor
crazy landfill madness but what you gonna dothis device was a replacement for the exact same model
the old one didnt work and this one does as expectedmy review is targeted primarily at the previous purchase of the same item
they seem to last about  to  months then the motion detection quits working
i did try other brands but seems these type of devices have a limited life span
i kept the old one for repurpose since the optical light sensor continues to worki am not sure this is really  ft  fed well into the dymo unit 
color good probably would not buy again thoughthis plastic labeling tape works well in my letratag and the printed labels look great at first
however i find that the white color of the labels does not hold up in lightexposed areas even indirect lightwhen i moved into a new home i applied these labels to light switch wallplates so that i wouldnt need to guess what the switches do
the labels adhere well and after a year none peeled or fell off
sadly however the white unprinted areas of the labels have begun turning yellow or tan and even brownish in rooms that receive lots of light
none of the labels are exposed to direct sunlight only light that bounces around the room from windowsim a bit disappointed with the poor longevity of these labels
soon i will need to remove and reprint my labels because a brown label looks pretty bad on a white wallplate
thankfully because the labels are made of plastic they usually pull off in one piece without leaving much residueyou put it into the machine type and print a label and it prints what you type 
no big dealive been a replaytv owner for several months
that said i am only somewhat satisfied with the overall quality of the systems software
i am satisfied with the replaytv hardware with one caveat
i am not satisfied  with replay customer supportwith each new software release it seems  that the same bugs linger and no new features appear
of course its hard  to tell what bugs replaytv is actually fixing because they wont tell you
even when you ask
nicelythey wont tell you what improvements  theyre planning either
of course you can guess that they dont want to  tip off any competition but considering the product marketing blitz coming  from tivo replay needs to be forthcoming to survive
replay is missing  some very nice tivo featuresi have  years of experience writing  software for highperformance embedded systems which is what replaytv is  a sophisticated computer and i cant seem to understand why replaytv  doesnt have a handle on some serious bugs still present in the  softwarewhile its true my unit doesnt flat out hang anymore it  still has some frustratingly random problems
specifically sometimes  it forgets to record a program even when disk space is available and no  recording conflicts appear in the recording schedule
 sometimes is  forgets which channels i have told it to ignore and not display and  sometimes it ignores channels i ask it to display
 sometimes the  software is so busy doing something who knows what that it cant keep up  with the video data being written to disk and i get a show filled with   second dropouts
this is one manifestation of the much talked about  flashing black screen sometimes the box forgets how to display a  picture and displays a black screen instead
 sometimes the channel  guide is wrong or when the channel lineup it may take several days to  work the kinks out
recently directv started offering local service and  duplicated some channelsincluding a special pbs channel for some  customers
it took two days for replaytv to fix their channel guide
meanwhile i was without pbs
 sometimes the audio is not synchronized  with the picture
this happens often when skipping commercials or when  using fastforward or rewind
 the quotrecorded showsquot listing is  so slow several seconds per line when scrolling that i dread having to  use it
you cannot use the pageupdown feature hereok what do i  like
 multiple video inputs allow you to hook up cabletv an antenna  and satellite service at the same time
the program information is merged  into a unified program guide
thats a neat trick
 knowing a few words  in a title of a movie is enough for the replaytv unit to record a show
i  use this as a recording quottodoquot list
if i hear of a movie im  interested in viewing i just add it to the list and if its ever  ontheair it gets recorded
 the commercial skip button is neat
and  even though i overshoot the program sometimes the instant replay button  takes me back a few seconds and im back in sync
 the replaytv box  controls my directv satellite receiver through a direct wired hookup  between the two
in my experience this is much more reliable than using  an infrared quotblasterquot that emulates remote control key  presses
 the user interface is somewhat spartan
frankly i love the  simplicity of it all
the channel guide is well suited to my  quotsurfingquot habits because it emulates the sony dss receiver  listing format i am quite familiar withwhat needs improvement  pageupdown in recorded shows listing progress indicator when moving  around within a recording sorted list of recordings framebyframe  control list of upcoming scheduled recordings when viewing a  recorded program status messages about upcoming recorded programs appear  on the screen
this is bothersome when youre actually copying something  important off the systemperhaps to a vcr
you need a way to turn the  messages offfrom a hardware standpoint their system seems reasonable
my only complaint is that the unit runs very hot and thus may shorten its  lifespan or cause unpredictable problems when enclosed in a cabinet with  an av receiver and other heat generating componentsperhaps my most  frustrating complaint is the quotcannedquot reply you receive when  sending email to customer support and the lack of content when they do  finally reply
yes i know that its a problem in your software
duh
thats why i complained
how about telling me when its going to be fixed  or whats causing it or the tracking number you use so i can ask about it  a month from nowin summary i give replaytv a  star rating
it mostly  works
it has software problems
but i continue to rely on it though  sometimes it can be frustratingi wasnt sure whether to give this philips tivo zero stars or five stars
zero stars because the quality stinks
five stars because its such an amazing producton the negative side the modem on my tivo went dead in just six months
after reading all the amazon reviews it appears that this is a very common problem that cant be ignored
it wouldnt be so bad if the warranty werent so short and if philipstivo support werent so completely incompetent
its now been five weeks and they still havent returned my tivo  even though i had to pay for them to fix it
im told the delay is because they ran out of refurbished units to send me
i dont find that an acceptable excusesince i still believe that tivo is the most amazing invention since the personal computer i still definitely recommend you buy one
besides its not tivo but philips that seems to have the quality problem im not sure how the sony versions rate on qualitybut there are some steps you should take if you buy onefirst buy the extended warranty plan that most stores offer
youll pay extra but it will still be less then paying  for philips to fix it
and store warranties last  years unlike the awful  months labor  year parts warranty that you get from philipssecond buy a special power strip that includes inputs for cable and telephone lines
this will stop any power surges from hitting your tivo which is what i suspect is causing a lot of these failures
my tivo died after during a mild thunderstorm
good luckhere are thee shortcomings as i have seen them over the past year with  tivo  it is very sensitive to power surges or little brownouts
when  the lights blink off in the house the tivo tends to lock up and this  frozen state can only be reversed by unplugging it for a few secs and  then plugging it back in and waiting for it to cycle through its startup  menu  mins
 quotpausequot which is by far the coolest thing  about tivo for me like quotpizza guy knocks dont want to miss this  next playquot is pretty timelimited
after  mins of pause it starts  playing again
once it starts playing again you cannot get all the way  back to where you paused it
 quotrecordquot is nice but nowhere  near  hours at any resolution you could stand to watch
even at the best  resolution the picture is seriously degraded from the original
 im  getting a little tired of the  per month
i know i agreed to it but  it really seems a little too much considering i paid for the hardware and  the menu which is what the  is supposed to be for is no better than  what my digital cable provider or dss system providesoverall i like  it but it should be improved before getting  stars from anyonenot sure what all the extra padding is for
the case is huge compared to other  port  switches
it works as designed but i wouldnt recommend it over any other  out therethis hub is pretty good
a little on the light side it might slide on the surface a little but the hub does a nice job at controling the network
this hub is good for linking home computers to a single isp dsl or cableit will also let you share a dial up account but your better off using it for some kind of broadband
on the account of being light weight you can use some kind of sticky mounts double sidedthe kind where all you have to do if pull on a tab and the adheasive should come right off with out damaging the surfacei gave this item  stars because it does what its supposed to do but not what i and most likely you want it to
you cannot connect two computers at the same time to the internet with this device
you need a router
printer sharing and file sharing didnt work either
two calls to linksys tech support and my own personal attempt to make it work add up to strike three unless you have a complicated set up it basically does nothingforget this thing and suck it up and get a router sure routers are a painbut they do what you want
this doesnt
a friend of mine wants it so hes getting a very early xmas present this yearmaybe i didnt read the description wellbut i recevived something different from the picture but it works its all what matters but the picture must be updated because it looks nicer than the picturetechnology that outdates itself quickly
now with wifi this is old technology that lasted about  year for me
the system worked ok but is history nowif you asked me what network card to purchase under  it would be a tossup between netgear and this card
i highly recomend both over those noname brand things you can get but neither are the greatest
i have however used linksys cards including this one in many application and ive never had a problem
beware that the drivers arent included in the os which can be a pain but of course they include drivers and their website posts the latest onesif you can get an intel or com nic do it
if you cant look at this one and the netgear
they will work for youthis is a basic network adapter that works well and does it job
if that is what you are looking for you cant go wrong with itbottom line this model of zip drive is usb plug and play and powers itself off the usb bus on the machine it is connected to
it is a little on the slow side for reading and writing of data due to its age but will work if you have zip disks that you still need to use
buy it usedusb flash and cd rw storage effective killed these products in the marketplace
i had some old files i needed to get access to and a stack of zip  and zip  disks that were the best candidates
a couple of desktops ago i had an internal zip drive and had been been lugging that machine around from place to place in case i needed it
finally i opted to let that machine go to free up space so recently when i decided to move those files onto newer storage i had to pick up a drive
i was very surprised to see that the price for one of these drives is still well over  new in   the device i bought was a little under  new after shipping was added on for about an hour of two or use
it gets three stars for being adequate if outdated technology
recommend to borrow the drive if you can find a person who has one or else buy it usedi have used a palm v since they where out in the market
now i just bought a hp jornada  and been wondering when we are going to have a device so powerful and nice looking as those powered with pocket pcim not talking about the color im talking on a device that can hold mission critical applications and tools for developing professional modules that can interact with bar code readers gps and radiofrecuency data interchangethis keeps palms quot
quot in the quotwhats going on with youquot appareli must recognize that palm vx size it amasing and very convenient if you like to carry it on your shirt pocketi hope that i did not make this purchase recently
i had this device  in the early s
it was pretty cool then i wish that i had purchased a handspring visor insteadi agree with all the positive comments that the other reviewer make regarding this unit
the unit is robust helpful if you drop it convenient fits nicely into your pocket has easy to use software and comes with enough memory that you can download a lot of mail to read offlinehowever it is just too expensive when compared to other handheld units
you can get all these great features on a visor for half the price
in addition the handspring comes with cheaper more interesting plug in cardsthe biggest advantage of the palm vx over the handspring is that is much quotsexierquot
smaller and more streamlined than the palm iii  style visorthe palm vx is convenient stylish and powerful
too bad it is overpricedworks well for the most part but if the battery dies all of its information gets wiped
i bought this a loooong time ago and i know people probably just used phones now for this kind of thing but if youre one of those who wants an organizer without having to pay for a damn phone and monthlies just be aware of this problem and dont let it diesure its a cd folder but they could have least of put the pages on  rings instead of stitching the pages in so at least that way the pages would not be lower than the outer zippers when it is opened up
you shouldnt have to worry about scratching your cds up on the zipper when you try to slide them back in
get a case logic cd folder instead they use ring binders for better organization of the pages
this product is slightly less than average even though it is only a cd folder they could have made it better for the costi have both this one and the caselogic version
they both work fine though i prefer the smooth fauxleather outer covering of the caselogic to the rougher more fabriclike feel of this one
just a personal preference thoughthese books work really well for cutting down on the amount of space that cds and dvds take up
the little cd booklets fit in the slots too so you can put those in there beside the disks to make them easier to findthey make these in different sizes but this is a pretty good compromise in terms of size and weight
the larger folders will save more space vs multiple smaller ones but the cds and dvds really get heavy in the higher numberskoskin dvd binder  capacity these albums which are made in china are given away for free in china when you buy  copy dvds
the dvds cost about a dollar each so for a  purchase you get one of these for free
must be quite a markup to get to i have used three cameras lately  sony dsc   olympus c  kodak dc all three have  megapixel and good lenses
the sony is the only one with no zoom but has the best picture quality and the best  lowlight exposure
there is also the dscf which has the huge xzoom  lens but it is too big to be nice
the sony is also the smallest and the  easiest to use
the operating system is similar to the dv camcorders
the  second best is the olympus c due to its zoom lens the viewfinder and  just weaker in low light conditions
the  pictures will fit onto a mb  smartmedia in hq a little more than with sony
the kodak i liked the  least mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors  in comparison
i currently use the olympus for professional work and the  sony due to its breast pocket size to snap great photos anywhere and  anytimei have had this camera for about  weeks now and all though i am somewhat satisfied i think that the picture quality could be better for this price and resolution
i also purchased an olympus dr for a friend and  although it is only  megapixels the color is much better the pictures  blow up almost as well despite the lower res and the lcd display is  sharper and easier to view in daylight
considering the huge difference in  price the olympus is a bargain
of course it does not zoom but you can  hardly call the mm of the kodak a real zoom
having used zoom lenses on  mm slrs for years i can testify that the  to  zoom is more like  medium wide angle to normal view rather than true zoom
you will have to  buy an accessory x lens and adapter to get true  zoom
if you want a less  expensive good performing zoom camera check out the olympus d zoomit is a replacement for a ancient kodak gel imaging system
it looks that it has been through a lot but works just fine
price was a bit high considering the age feature and the condition of the thingive used this camera for a while now
pictures are good quality and with the price of compactflash comming down its a good deal
my only gripe is the compactflash slot is very fragile
if you switch cards a lot it may break
in such a case youll have to send kodak your camera and they will send you a refurb backi frankly was disapointed that my month old camera in great condition was replaced with a refurb that was obviously much older with obvious signs of wear and tear plus a couple dead pixels on the display
all of which are considered quotokayquot by kodak
i really felt like i paid a new camera price for a used camerawhat can i say right cable right pricenow adays you can easily be raped over the coals for quality cables that was not the case with this monster cable it wass as expected with the twist of being reasonably pricei beat my set of mks and i must say they suffered it withstyle
after smashing  pair of them into my cars din for a year i pulled out a pair and put them to work with my home theatre
they look good as new and sound as fine as evergood price for a reason
it may be defective dont buy from market warehouse
the sound is rather dull but cleanive had this cable for about  months
it made an immediate difference to my system
it sounds clear transparent smooth
also i like the directional indicators on the cable which help in installationmy only gripe is that the connectors are cheaply made
when one of the quotgrabquot pins broke off i realized the connector is not all metal construction like you would expect for the price
the pin was made of plastic  quite a disappointment
i hoped for better at this pricethis cable is worth every penny
the connector is beautiful
the m in monster is wonderfully printed and the finger grips feel like work of art
other than the connector i dont have much to say about this cable compared to other toslink cables
the innards are really all the same
i can say that there is a marked improvement over the extended coathanger i had been using previously to connect my receiver to my audio equipmentyeah i dont get this obsession with monster brand cable either
when i got my  setup i thought the only way to get  sound was to use an optical wire anyway
well on my system it was as it had no rca jacks for all those discrete channels
all it has is one optical jack and one set of lr rca jacks for a stereo vcr sourceso all i did was go to wal mart or radio shack cant remember which and bought the only optical cable they had for like  bucks
works just fine
my problem if anything is my receiver
but i think ill be upgrading sometime later this yearthis is your basic surge protector strip with right angle plug and colorcoded plugs for various audiovisual components
i have for a year and is still workinggood power protection device colorful does not do anything in particularfor a monster product this guy is kind of cheaply made
like another reviewer said it just kind of feels cheap
i know its just a power strip and thats why a bought a cheaper one but it seems a bit inferior for a monster product
im really no fan of theirs but at least their products look and feel as if they are better than the rest
this one however seems like it would fall apart with minimal abuse
i have another apc brand surge protector that my computer stuff is plugged into that is far and away superior to this thingi needed additional power strips and this fit the bill
there is nothing fancy about this strip minus the colors and the labels
while it is nice for you to have labels so you dont have to follow the cord most of the time the labels will not fit what you are going to plug in there and will just have label them yourself anyway
if you have the larger plugs like cell phone chargers you are probably going to take up two plugs as they are close together and not really angled for itworks
its a monster and quality built but only good for standard plug cords
i would rather have seen the plugs run down the strip instead of across itit is what it is
works perfect however when you read the directions in the package honestly there is no warrantee
your entire house would have to be grounded to this one unit in order for it to cover the damage from a power surge
that is what homeowners is all about
if you are worried about your saved computer stuff then get a cloud
although i do not regret making this purchasegreat product
works well
if you over amp this product it will shut off but will probably never work again
i have two surge protectors that got overloaded and never worked again
monster has a great warranty  replacement but they are a bit difficult to get to customer service or help
make sure you know your jules and amps for what you are using it for
otherwise it works great and has decent spacing for  larger outletsjury is still out shortly after i connected my tv to it and used the coaxial inputoutput to protect my tv from lightning or whatever i now cant receive hd signal from some channels like  and above
analog version of the same channel comes in fine but when i tried to change it to the digitalfrom channel  to channel  i get a blank screen with a weak signal message
ill try to bypass the surge protector and try it direct from wall just annoyingwhen i first hooked up my new hdtv and dvr i couldnt get a signal to the dvr
when the cable guy came out he said the problem was a weak signal
after working on my cable for  minutes it turns out that the surge protection of the cable coax on this unit loses too much of the signal
dont use itotherwise this product is finebut i could have bought a cheaper one that didnt have these extra featuresthis powercenter is a good solid device
it will give you plenty of connections for your home theatre devices
the only drawback in my opinion is that it has a high profile which leaves the cables high off the floor  inches before you can bend the cable
it is not really much higher than average surge suppressors but enough so that i could not tuck it under my entertainment center or mount it on the wall behind without leaving a big gap behind it
i have no doubts about its protective claims
the monster brand is very reliable and indicates decent quality
i have been buying their cables for years both for home theatre applications and semiprofessional audio gear
if i had to choose again though i would try to find something with a lowermore compact profilesurge protection is not the only issue one need consider with respect to television stereo or computer hardware
ac power noise is another aspect to consider in order to maximize the quality and life of your investments
i found the monster cable powercenter a fine small investment for surge protection while also allowing a modest improvement in tv picture qualityupdate a year later the surge protector flat out went dead
no signs of power surge as others in the area were present and did not suddenly die
overall as typical with monster products overpriced and apparently not one that is long lastingdo you own a  inch tv with a  dvd player
dont bother
do you own a  amp a  dvd player and a set of speakers that you might bury yourself in
dont bother buying unless you want to burn money
monster may look pretty and the performance of monster vs no name is certainly proven in the quantifiable scientific analysisbut your ear cant hear itsimply put buy comparable cables with and without the monster name and run a test with your ears
you will probably find that you can save yourself significant  by purchasing equally constructed cabling without the monster namei bought this one at amazon market place  the splitter was made in taiwan to replaced my old cheap splitter out side the houses tv cable box
the tvs picture quality look the same and cable internet speed doesnt get any faster
the worse is my internet was cut off when the tv is turn on with this fancy splitter
i had to switch back my old two dollars splitter
wasted times and money
may be those lucky guys have good result with this monster splitter was made in usamonster has created a great mythology about smooth sonic performance and all kinds of other benefits to using their goldplated quite expensive splitter
the main difference in splitters is in the accuracy of the internal construction whether or not a circuit board is used and the quality of the shielding box construction and the transformer core materialhowever there is one thing to remember and its a biggie if you have digital cable the subtleties of rendition in either video or audio are virtually independent of the quality of the box
normal cable is analog if you have interference or a weak signal you get bars snow crackly sound either all the time or periodically
maybe your poor quality splitter needs to be replaced
with digital cable you either get it or you dont
when you have weak signal you will have horribly choppy blocky looking video or none at all same goes for the audio
if everything is working ok upgrading your splitter wont incrementally improve your audio or video quality
in fact nothing will except perhaps a new tv or a better set top box with better output circuitry behind the digitaltoanalog decode stageadding an expensive overpriced splitter with gold plated hoohaws may stave off corrosion  years down the line but so will a thin layer of silicon grease
it certainly wont give you smoother sonic performance or any of those subtle differences that they claim are worth it
just so you knowover priced and the signal loss and picture quaility is no better then when using the low cost units
save your moneyyes the price is just great
with my  gift certificate i can get the thing for about 
i just test the first disc and it went fine for the first hour
but towards the end of the disc i start to hear big  skippingshuttering
its just like playing mp on a busy computer
i hope  that i have time to test the rest of the discs today and give it a  recoomendationi have used md for  or  years and have used a variety of disks
and as a digital media naturally buying the cheapest md has its appeal because as long as the media works at all its going to sound the samehowever it might not be worth getting this brand
i keep pretty good care of the mds but of the  i bought when i first got into minidiscs  or  have had problems where the metal slide either comes off in my pocket or sticks open
ive been able to get them back on right but ive made concert recordings that id hate to lose id prefer the problem didnt come up at all
i havent had a problem with one coming off in the player and i dont think thatll happen but you hate to take chances with an expensive playerso it might be worth getting these mds if theyre at the right price and if you can stand to lose what youve recorded to the md
still ive taken to buying sony multipacks and using the remaining blank memorex mds only sparinglywhat a world
when we bought this memory card it was big
you know the rest of this story
what would you use a measly  mb for now
 picturesso far the only way i have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide i am not going to give up until i get my rebate
not worht it
the company uses a web site called wheresmyrebate com
do not trust them
other than that the card is excelent and i recomend the card just not the company policiesunlike lexar or sandisk viking does not design or make the components that go into their flash memory cards instead they use offtheshelf components controller and memory core made by others
this means two things  lower cost to viking and  compatibility with devices may not be as robust as lexar or sandisk
there have been numerous reports about incompatibility between viking flash memory and various digital cameras and pdas
you should do a web search before buying this productthat said this viking cf card should work in most digital cameras or older pocket pcs that take cf
the rated speed of x means this is not suitable for digital slrs such as the nikon d or canon eos digital rebel which need higherspeed cf cards x or higher
most consumer nonslr digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate
mb holds about  mp highquality pictures depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model
i personally recommend if you have a mp or more camera you should have a mb memory card as your primary card while carrying a mb card like this viking as a sparein short this viking mb cf card is good for the money
just make sure its compatible with your digital camerai was really happy with the viking cf cards till i got a lexar
it is noticabilly faster
with the cannon that matters cause the shutter is already kinda slow
i recomend you check out the lexari wanted to try these video tapes for a long time so finally i decided to spend all that money and ordered them and what do i get
tdk ultimate quality light blue and green box with a yellow and orange color stipe acrosswrong item
amazon also sell those tapes for a lot less
when contacted the seller this is what they saidhurricane sandy wipe us out picking up the pieces somewhere else can you hold your orderwhat do you say to that
i told the selleri feel very sorry and had no idea and to forget about the order
since i never was able to try the highly rated video tapes the ones they send me are just ok
thank you ddi bought one of these a year ago and it worked really well for the first few months but more recently ive noticed that it has gotten more and more difficult to get reception even in completely open areas outside
i suspect that something has happened to the internal antenna  i have to admit that im not that easy with electronic devices and probably have abused it while traveling more than i should have but the same cell phones have held up betteri bought this used it a coupla years then gave it to my niece and bought myself a lowrance igo
used it a coupla years then it died on a geocaching trip
although the lowrance cost less and had more features i went right down to wally world and bought another etrex  this time the h model with more sensitivity
for one thing i needed it now
but besides that the lowrance was just too irritating to use while the etrex is a pleasurethat said the problem with the base model etrex is that it requires a special adapter  to connect it into your computer to download waypoints and itll only hold waypoint names of six characters
the adapter costs so much that its cheaper to buy the next model up which has a usb connector and plugs right in
the only reason i didnt was that i already had the adapteri have not used a gps unit before but purchaed this based on reviews
with nothing to compare it to i can report the following  although the instructions are straight forward i found that the buttons are not so easy to navigate
i make many mistakes in programing and have to start over
i also found the this is not very accurate
at  feet the gps unit will show any direction
i have to get to within  feet of a way point to start getting any type of accuracy
if i did not know the direction of the way point at  feet i literally have to walk in circles and watch the unit point me false directions
again at  feet it is accuratei have used this in the up of michigan and it takes about  minutes to get the satellites up and running
also if you want to save the information on your computer you will need to buy the cords about  once i purchased these i then found i would have to purchase the software it was not free at garmin so that would be another 
i returned the cords and did not get the software
so if you want to save your information plan on spending another for my first gps i think it is okay
i think if you are hiking you would need to do a lot more research and probably spend more money to get something with greater accuracyi have  of these sandisk usb readers they will read only  type of memory card so if you have devices with compactflash multimediacard memory smartmedia etc youll need  reader per format
they can be difficult to setup as the software in both cases required an update from their website nice site userfriendly and more importantly there are known conflicts with other device drivers you may have on your computer such as cdrw drives and zip drives
while these conflicts are mentioned on the sandisk website the solutions they offered were not always helpful
once solved this device is great
i have since purchased the viking reader and have encountered no conflicts at allgot my st vcr in  jvc
tapes were around  then
needless to say i have gone thru many different unitsthis a good unit
nice and simple
ive used various similiar panasonic models for years but these machines are getting old and you cant expect them to last for many more yearsonce upon a time i owned a nikon and assorted nikor lenses all carefully stored in a sleek aluminum zero case
i was a camera snob
then had kids  and couldnt be bothered to lug around an slr plus attachments
with the  excuse that i was buying it for my wife i purchased one of the original  olympus clamshell designs in  secretly i loved this little camera
not  long after i sold the cherished nikon
so it goesbut after  years the  trusty olympus was showing its age
and the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times
so i was in search  of its replacementim comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camerai was intrigued  sufficiently to visit wolf camera and look at oneif a picture is worth  a thousand words experiencing something must be worth at least  unlike its mm cousins olympus stylus epic zoom  qd cg camera  comes to mind and is what i wound up buying this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different companyit is large wont  fit comfortably in a shirt pocketit is heavyit is square and  boxlike none of the stylus epics sensuous linesif you are attracted  to oneshot cameras and specifically to olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the webthis camera is a good entry level camera but leaves much to be desired
first it eat batteries forcing you to rechargeable bateries and a adapter for use when downloading images
nd the camera has no optical zoom forcing you to use the digital and the lcd screen which drains batteries
my third gripe about the camera is that the button for the lcd screen is resecced so it wont get turned on accidentaly but the button makes it very very very dificult to turn on
i reapeatadly find my self stuggling to turn on the lcd screen
my th and final gripe is that it has no usb connection with the package
with the serial connection it can take me  or  hours to donwload  or so pictures
i would suggest buying a memory card reader so this is a good entry level camera but not much elsedz is very unlike the z and it is made of cheap plastic
ofcourse the menu has improved but the overall quality has declined
i noticed the following  camera body is made of cheap plastic   the zoom lens makes an annoying noise when you turn the camera on
  price is falling  down like a rockits ok but cant watch vcds with itif you do not have a problem with your equipment you might have a good experience with it other wise you will regret buying this product
when i upgraded my computer and tried to install the cradle and the hotsync program the computer did not even booth it just went dead
after  minutes of a long distance phone call to palm support service no toll free number they told me the problem was the port so they could not solve it  the port was working
i wrote an email explaining the problem the answer two days later was i did not give enough information as i did not tell what hotsync program i installed in my computer  none
 they clearly did not even bother to read the nature of the problem
they saw a missing field and they just assumed they could not help
eventually after the level of complaints palm received on the issue was large enough they informed via the website that some cradles are defective and they need to be replaced however the part cannot be ordered via web or email support had to be called
another  minute long distance call and i was informed that in  hours the cradle adaptor will be in my house
after  days without adaptor i sent an email to support asking for it giving it the service order number
the answer was to call parts an  number only  minutes of my time were wasted before i was informed i needed to call support as parts had nothing to do with it
another  minutes of long distance to order again the part as the service representative made a mistake in the previous order so it could not be processed
when i asked for the order number they informed me that their database is down and they are just filling orders by hand and they could not give me a confirmation number
good luck if you still decide to buy thisfive years later i have been blessed enough not to need any more customer support and i cannot see my life without a palm piloti would ask that anyone who may be interested in purchasing this product to first try and see the unit for yourself
the reason why is that prior to actually seeing the palm iiic in person i was basically going on the reviews and photos that i had been seeing in the advertisementsfirst of all the screen is not as bright as i had first assumed
the palm website the advertisements and the quotdemoquot unit a fake palm iiic with a printed fake screen found at various outlets shows the screen as a brilliant white color
i thought that this was what i would see when i finally went to the store compusa to see the palm iiic in personupon arriving there i saw the unit and picked it up
the screen was very dim and rather gray
my first impression was that the units brightness control was set to low
i brought up the brightness screen to adjust the unit and to my surprise it was set on maximum
i asked a store rep if this unit was broken
he said no and that this was the maximum brightness
i also saw the handspring prism there and the screen appeared just as gray and dimthis was very dissapointing as i was expecting a very bright screen
as palms go its a nice little unit
it runs the palm software and has a truckload of software programs that are freely available on the internet
is the palm iiic worth it
in my estimation the answer is a definite no
as this units primary attraction is the color screen i find that this palm does not meet the very basic requirements needed for a pdaand that requirement is legibility
if you are working in a office enviornment or even in a commonly well lit area you will find that the brightness of the screen will be a major problemit is just too dim and lacks contrast
the screen as i have mentioned before is dingy looking under normal lighting conditionsthe high price of this unit does not justify its color ability
i believe that anyone in the market for this device should definitely try the unit out for themselves before purchasing it
the ads and photos you see of the palm are very different from the real world screen of the palm iiic and are rather misleadingtry before you buythe palm iiic is definitely a nice step up for palm
dont expect much stuff in color out of the box though
youll get the best results with addon programs
datebk for instance is just superb in color
i love my  monthly view with all the little colored icons
some of the games out now  are a delight in color with more comingbut its definitely not  perfect
others have mentioned how pixelated it looks
this does seem to  bother some people more than others
i dont mind it a whole lot but it  definitely cant compare with the great color screens on the pocket pcs
i  get a kick out of the uproar over the latest jornada being bit rather  than bit as advertised i would kill for bit on the palm
viewing  outdoors is indeed problematic but i found that turning the brightness all  the way up and lightly shading the screen is enough for me to use it
not  ideal perhaps but fine with me
i tend to use my palm in poorly lit  situationsthere the color screen is a delight versus that hideous green  reverse backlighting
again you can turn the brightness down when less is  needed easily enoughlooking at the pocket pcs though palm has a long  way to go
they are pretty much the size of the palm iiic now but with  more memory better color screens faster processors etc
slightly worse  battery life perhaps but not significantly soi am also still looking  for some real improvements in the base applications
progress on the palm  platform seems to be going too slowly for this dedicated user
not sure i  am switching yet but i am definitely getting tempted
if you really want  color it just isnt that big a jump to get a pocket pc
however the rd  party apps right now keep palm in the leadkeyboard was neat but i could not get it to operate with the palm pilot which should have been returnedthis unit is a few yearsgenerations old and i think all the standard reviews about have it covered  but a few reviews ive seen mentioned that their unit stopped working and the took ti back etc
well a friend of mines stopped working and i thought id share with you how i fixed it it was pretty simpleif yours is broken the same way probably a disk got jammed in it maybe from moving the unit and jostling the disks around the root of the problem is that a little white plastic knob on the end of an arm has come out of the slottrack its supposed to be in
when that happens the symptom is that the carousel wont turn at all the only thing that works is the front door will still openshut but nothing else mechanical worksthis white knob that needs to be put back into the black slottrack is just to the left of the area where the disk plays looking straight on from the front of the unit
you can reach it easily by just removing the top cover  screws on the sides and  in the back
ill try to upload a picture with a red arrow drawn to the area
update bummer
 ive got a picture but apparently users cant upload their own pictures for this particular itemrecently my  yr old pioneer pdm bit the dust so i went shopping for another pioneer cd player and found this  disc playerpros this holds all of my cd collection and then somemultiprogramming capability although i havent had the opportunity to use them because i dont have the time to wait for the cd player to confirm my choicescons my old cd magazine player never made me wait more than  seconds to play its next track when in random mode
however this  disc player has made me wait more than  seconds between tracksalso when i connected the cd player  cassette recorder synchro cables between the two units it disabled the cd players remote
i havent tried to record anything yet but am discouraged by the extremely small remote for the receiver that requires a magnifying glass to read and is a phat phinger accident waiting to happenthis makes it very difficult to interact with the pioneer system without a lot of effortease of use features historicalqualitytechnology may have passed this camera by as you can buy a smaller  megapixel camera for less money but ive used this camera for  years with nary a problem
you may be able to get a good deal on a used model
i use it as camera that is shared by many departments where i work so it gets heavy usethe quality of photos taken in bright light on the quotfinequot setting is stunning and prints well as  x s you can even get away with larger sizes if you dont mind a little pixelation
the cameras auotmatic mode is adequate for most shots but you can adjust the shutter speed and other customizable features
the pivoting lens body is also handy to get into tight spaces
the lcd screen is bright but can be hard to read outdoorsbattery life is  photos with rechargables
i dont recommend using alkalines with this camera but they work in a pinchthe biggest drawback with this camera is the flash
the proximity of the lens to the flash means youll be correcting lots of quotred eyequot on your pc or mac
the flash is also very weak in low to medium light situations and you cant add an external flash to the camerathis camera sometimes fails to start when turning it on or shuts off after a few seconds on but turning it off and on again seems to help
i attribute these glitches to age and abuse due to heavy use rather than poor manufacturingboy  when this camera can get a good focus lock theres enough lighting the planets are in alignment and angels sing the pictures that come out of this camera are outstandingthe only problem though are those pesky angels and planets
they just dont cooperateive used an olympus  cz for the past year
i found the pictures to be of somewhat  consistent quality  some better than others  maybe  out of a  quotrollquot mb smartcard to be worth sharing with my familyi bought the nikon   before i got the oly  and had to return it out of frustration with the  user interface and the inability of the camera to obtain a focus lock  and  take the pictureand thats if the camera didnt lock up
heck  its  not windows
you shouldnt need to quotrebootquot your camera
in a  week the  locked up requiring me to take the batteries out five or  six times
the  was just as badi found a better ui with the    but similar frustrations with focus
in low light situations you better be  on a tripod and have a flashlight handy to let the camera get a focus  lock
from what i understand there are cameras coming out fuji has one  that have what slr owners are used to  a low light focus assist  illumination lamp
this camera desparately needs oneif you need to take  a picture of something moving  get a focus lock before your subject gets  into view  or the camera becomes very confused and youre left staring at  the viewfinders blinking green quotim not ready to take a picture  i  cant focusquot light
and your subjects look at you smiling politely  quotdid you get itquotquotnoquotquotboy that camera is  slow huh
i thought the box said superhigh performancequotquotha  ha
very funny
wheres my old oly
i want this shotquotanyway  make  sure you buy it at some place that has a  day money back guarantee
you  may need to exercise that guarantee
besides the bad focus  and system hangs i also found nikons windows software to be buggy
youll  want to get a standalone usb card reader
and why didnt nikon embrace  smartcard type ii
i want to use that ibm microdrive gosh durn it
btw   digital photography is great
im hookedi currently own a diamond rio pmp that i won at a trade show
it is a first generation player and it shows
badly placed controls are the secondworst thingim curious if anyone can answer the following  question
does the nomad ii fix my biggest peeve with the rio namely if  i stop the rio in the middle of a song when i start it again it goes back  to the beginning of the track rather than starting off where i stopped  like my portable cd players would
pause would work but it turns itself  off in about a minute anyway losing my place as above
not a big deal on  minute hits but a pita for symphonies and progressive rock with tracks  as lon as  minutesanyway if anyone is willing to try this in their  nomad ii id really like an answerbengreat set of features
i really wanted the radio stations and recorder
but i found the reception for the radio to be poor and i live in a major city
i also found the design of the battery holder and cap to be a royal  pain
i have to fight to get it open and the battery and memory insert  very poorly designed
you need to remove the memory to remove the  batteryi love the wireless controloverall enormous advancement  from the mp players of a year ago but engineeringwise they needed to  spend a little more time in beta testingthis mp player is rated by consumer reports as  all around 
but that only comparing to other mp players that are not so new
i purchased this mp player looking to use it in the gym
it has great features and is very user friendly
very light in weight and small to fit with its handy belt clip
the only problem is this unit only can hold mb memory about less then an houre of music
this was not enough for my to use with a  hour work out 
the other negatives are the memory slot is in the battery compartment snug tight
their is no room for you ot pull the card out and the battery is in the way
very poor design on this matter
i ask my self why creative would design such a great device but only stores up to mb or music and have such a poor desing for memory storage
also if you are buying this item but about  batteries you will need them it eats the power up  hours a battery if that
suggest the nomad  mg  with  mb 
this item is not price justified due to the lack of memorythe unit broke a year after i bought it
i wouldnt buy another player from creative labs because it is too fragile
i only used the unit at the gym a few times a week
the first thing that broke was the wired remote which i found to be very useful
the menu on the unit is easy enough to figure out but rather slow to navigate
it takes several steps just to check the time
i liked the behind the head ear phones they dont pinch my ears but i guess im one of the lucky ones
the ear phone sound quality is just average
id have to say the quality of the product as a whole is just averagewhen i received the flash i was disappointed to discover that the seller had accidentally left batteries in the flash which had badly corroded rendering the flash unusable
however i contacted the seller and he immediately refunded my payment no fuss at all
while this purchase didnt work out how i wanted i would happily purchase from him againi struggled with this thing for about  months on my mac and i would almost always have to unplug and replug the usb connector into the hub to be able to actually sync
i figured perhaps it was a deficiency in macos of course my windows box is prone to forgetting that it has old style or usb ports which made it even less usable for syncing and i would have to live with it and just not demonstrate syncing my palm when i was showing off my maclast weekend i had a mishap and my palm was crushed rendering it unusable but thankfully it was willing to sync and for that palm should be hailed
i bought a new pda the same day going with the sony clie ill write a review in a few weeks after using it a while longer
suddenly syncing worked exactly the way it was supposed to work
so my advice is sell off your old vx iii vii etc
skip the usb kit and buy a usbnative palm
yes it will cost more in the short run but youll find that your life will be much improved overalli  got  a  palm  m  and  i  bought  a  cradle  and  the  cradle  was  serial  port  so  i  bought  this  palmconnect  usb  and  i  got  it  and  i  got  the  software  already  i  downloaded  the  software  a  couple  monthes  before  i  got  the  hotsync  cradle
and  when  i  turn  my  computer  on  oh  yeah  by  the  way  i  have  a  mac  os    when  i  turn  the  computer  on  and  press  the  hotsync  botton  and  works  great  but  if  i  run  palm  desktop  software  and  than  after  that  do  the  hotsync  it  freezesif youre using windows installing this may be a bit of a challenge
this worked for me install the palm desktop software if you havent done so already
youll need  minimum
i have 
 download the latest palmconnect usb kit drivers from the palmone site
these are a separate download from the palm desktop software
the file is a zip archive extract the files to your desktop or any other easytoremember place do not connect the usb kit to the hotsync cradle yet
connect it to your computer first
if windows reports that it has found a palmconnect usb adapter youre on the right track
when windows asks you for the location of the drivers give it the location where you extracted them in the previous step connect the usb kit to the hotsync cradle rightclick on the hotsync manager icon in your system tray
make sure local usb and local serial are both checked attempt a hotsync
if it doesnt work rightclick on the hotsync manager tray icon
select setup and go to the local tab
change the com port until you find one that worksso much for plug and play eh
if your system has a serial port if its a pc it probably does use it instead and save yourself some cash
youre not gaining any speed at all by going usbthis product is merely a converter not a speed boosterand as you can see its a lot more effort than its worthon the other hand if you have a usbequipped mac it works as advertised no glitches at all
just make sure that you install the latest palm desktop for mac software first not the outdated version on the cd
get it from the palmone or apple website
i recommend the latter since it wont require you to provide personal information
just search for palm desktop from the applecom front page and it should be the first resultits truly lovely to look at
but useful
no dont think so
why
awkward
have to unzip to get to palm zip back up to put palm away
alot of zipunzipping if you ask me
if you dont use your palm often its nice  but if its an essential part of your life then its aggravating to have to  deal with this casethis product is good however i have had some problems with it the wheel is very loose physically which makes it hard to use for detailed  work as it tends to roll more than you want it to depending on the  surface it drags actually more than my regular intellimouse if you  pick it up slightly you lose your place it just doesnt  quotfeelquot as sensitive as my regular intellimouse
this may be the  responsivness of the usb port but i dont think so when you move it  very fast across the surface it loses its place and goes haywire causing  the cursor to fly all over the screen ending up somewhere other than where  you wanted it
my regular intellimouse is much less sensitive to this  problem
i gave it three stars because i should never have to  clean it it comes with usb amp ps adaptor  this means i can use  it in the usb socket of my notebook and plug a full size keyboard in at the  same time
very nice 
overall only an ok producti have used this mouse for about  years and it has served me well for everything except games
this is one of the first generation optical mice so the sensor doesnt take as many picturessecond as the newer mice
what does this mean
if youre playing fast games fps especially and make a quick movement the mouse will move in a random direction
very bad scenarioive also gotten quite into tiger woods  and this mouse is very bad for the game because you need to have perfectly smooth motion to swing the club since if you move it too fast the mouse moves another direction causing bad swingsand its good because it trains your hand to have perfectly smooth motion to swing the club since if you move it too fast the mouse moves another direction causing bad swingsso when i get a next generation mouse my game should be unstoppable logitechs entry optical model the most inexpensive quality but basic optical mice ive worked with is much better and doesnt have this same problem and you can move it as fast as you want without negative resultsin conclusion the main points of this mouse arepros the side buttons and clickable wheel are convenient and programmable optical technology means no more cleaning the mouse ballthen again every optical mouse has this feature good size not too heavy like the explorer the next model upcons games will cause much frustration maybe not all will see this but mine is rather cheaply build made in china and the right mouse button randomly to makes odd feedback when clickedi suggest skipping this one and going a newer generation mouse with similar featuresi like how it glowsi like how its mowsits doesnt get jammedbut its so big like a ramat first it seems quite quickerthen the thrill level fallsim back to my old rollerclickerits more agile and smallthe optical mouse tracking works quite well
my desks surface doesnt have enough color variation for the mouses camera to track properly so i still use a mousepad but i still find the mouse pointers movement to be  quite a bit more consistent than with most mechanical micei dont find  the two side buttons on the mouse to be particularly practical though i  dont need to go back and forward in my browser often enough to justify two  mouse buttons just for that purpose and the back button is positioned in  such a way that its fairly easy to click it accidentally with your thumb  while moving the mouse
i also find the extra led to be a bit silly
this is the led in the curved window at the bottom edge of the mouse that  you can see in the picture it has no functionits just there to glow and  impress passersby into saying quotwow that must be that newfangled  optical modelquotyou might want to consider the basic intellimouse  with intellieye instead it has the same optical mouse mechanism in a more  standard form factor without the side buttons and the extra dayglo ledpros very compact solid feel easy to hold x is pretty powerfulcons too hard to hold steady poor performance in low light it was impossible for me to focus both eyes at the same time and adjust the interpupilary distancei returned these the day after i got themi purchased this pair of binoculars for less than  and for this price it does a good enough job
compared to my bushnell x pair it is about a quarter size larger and the entering light amount is less
therefore although the object appears slightly more magnified it is also dimmer
like all bushnells this pair is easy to usei bought this item to look out my th fl window and the binoculars didnt seem as small as they were when i got them
i never used them and now they are in a box collecting dust
i would only recommend this to children not adults
these are way too small for adultsis has only mm lense size make it somewhat dark to watch details from far away of concert hall
its really small when folded about in  in size which makes easy carryi was not thrilled with these binoculars
the main reason is that they do not have the option of sharpening one eyepiece separately and then sharpening the focus overall with the center focus wheel
there is only type of focus the center mechanism so if you have one eye that is sharper than another you cannot fine tune these binocs
for the weaker eye
otherwise they seemed like a decent pair of binoculars for the price  just not for mei bought these specifically for a cruise in the caribbean the price seemed right
dont expect to do any serious dolphin watching with these
you pay for what you get
they are better suited for near field viewing such as viewing birds in your backyardthe compact size is great for packing these on hiking trip they can easily fit in your pocket or day pack
although i have not tried they may also be good for the ball park or theater because of the practical sizethe binoculars felt good and compact just as advertised
however mine had cloudy rings in the field of vision
i returned these and bought the olympus x pc iii classic binocular from amazon which is also compact
images in those are much betterthey are inexpensive relatively clear and compact
the most irritating feature is the neck strap is attached near the center of the binoculars causing them to stand off your chest when hanging around your neck
this causes them to not sit flat but bounce and twist when walkinghiking
the right occular adjustment is not tight enough and you must constanty readjust it as it move so easily
these are for quick spotting distant objects or for kids
not quality glass for longer glassing sessions
thank youi bought these as a christmas gift for my son
my son was thrilled with these binoculars
and when i tried them out myself i was impressedwe left the day after xmas to go on a guided nature tour of costa ricaafter a few days on the tour one of the guides had a look and noticed that the optics were not aligned
i checked myself and there was a significant double image effect
my son was  at the time not a wild kid but a normal red blooded boy
its possible that there was some mishandling but he had not dropped them and i dont think any of his handling could be classified as abuse
besides he really did not have time to do anything abusive to themi think if you plan to use these for the occasional concert or trip to a national park etc  this should work well for you and is a great value
if your looking for something that you can toss in a bag and carry half way around the world or hiking across the continental divide  you probably should consider something elsei wish id gone for the x set instead
these provide good magnification but are difficult to hold steady enough to make out the extra detail you get
the lenses are clear and only distort a little near the edgesas a traveler i needed a small lightweight foldingtype of binocular with at least a x rating
shipping was fast and i just returned from a trip where i used them in the san francisco bay bridge area
the first thing that i noticed right away was how difficult it was to adjust the focus setting on the right    eyepiece  i had to monkey around for a whileand when i finally set it at a good position the result was not satisfactory for me
it just seemed to be off a biti used them in both an urban and beach environments and they were just adequate  probably more useful in a archery or gun range to be used only as a spotter scope if thatbushnell makes some really great binoculars but this is the cousin they never talk aboutas a photographer im always searching for possible working sites from which i can position myself and my camera  but this was too much trouble and i didnt want to use my cameras zoom as that drains the batteries
 conclusion  this would be a great gift for a cub scout or new boy scout as the price is really great and they are small  lightweight so that works
i was generous with  stars because they are no better than a  star rating
but for  bucks i cant really expect a whole loti think these are ok for the price but i would get the  or x instead
the size of these is just too big
the subcompact size is betterwith these i might as well carry full size xs
they will not fit in a fanny pack where the xs will and also fit in a large purse
the xs could be used at a concert but these are just too big to takebut the price is pretty good so  starsthis is a small lightweight binoculars
can fold and put in a shirt pocket
the optics however are not that great
an x magnification for this size lens means you dont see clearly and they could have used more stabilization especially given how light it is
picture keeps shaking especially hard to focus as you have to turn a dial while looking at this vibrating image
cant complain given the price but i wanted something that is easy for a little child to use
i am not sure if this fits the billthese work well enough and for the price i cannot complain too much
i do have issues getting to constantly show a clear picture
i bought these to help me sight my rifles red dot at the range
it work well enoughi got these for my cruise to alaska and they were fine
cant really beat them for the price
if you want to see something very very close  i would say buy something better
they were good for what i was going to use them forthis review is for the x clam version of the bushnell compacts
it has the company name in metal color on the side of the binocstubes
it seems amazon has merged this item with the older
x compacts with the company name in rubber relief
i believe there is a substantial difference between the two items especially in dimensionsi bought these binocs for usd and i do not think they are worth more
the current price for a factory demo version at the amazoncom is about usdprosvery small and lightweight
id say up to  smaller than most other x compact binocscomfortably wide field of view
does not give feeling of peeping through a holereasonably sharp in center part of image at distances less than mcorrect color renditionrobust and more expensive feel than the average compact binocsreasonably pricedpouch includedconsdespite the wide field of view it is only the absolute center of the image that has any useful sharpness to the image
in addition the glass gives an uneven image somewhat similar to looking through the bottom of a glass bottle
this is however not so bad that it renders the binocs useless
they work pretty well at shorter distances for objects centered in the imagethe focus wheel tend to be less responsive
when shifting the focus direction of the wheel there is a lag until the image responds to the turn of the wheel
this makes the binocs less useful for observing nonstationary objects such as birdsin conclusion id say they are pretty ok for the price i paid
i love the small size makes me bring them along in my bag to and from work every day
i would however not have anything against paying  times that money for the same binocs if the producer could put better glass in them i read somewhere that they have bk most midprice binocs have bak i dont know if that would make any improvement
however better glass would give a quite nice set of very compact binocs well worth a little more bucks
in fact there is a big jump in price and unfortunately often also in size between the ultracheap x binocs on the market usually usd until the next level above usually usdi ordered these binoculars to replace a pair that i had for years
i wasnt exactly sure of the power of the originals but they were close
the binoculars i received from amazon were indeed bushnell powerview but they dont look anything like the picture you see
i guess bushnell changed the style and kept the name and amazon kept the picture
i wont send them back because these certainly functional
but i really wanted what was in the picturei actually bought these binoculars for a justin timberlake concert my son and i were going to
having ok seats and not wanting to carry around a bulky high powered pair i purchased these binoculars
for the price they really really served its purpose
it folds nicely and fits into any pocket or since its lightweight you can easily put it in the pouch provided and wear it around your neckthis is an inexpensive fully usable pair for youth too
but even without abusing it the eye piece feel apart after about  months
unfortunately it wasnt easily fixable
hoping the replacement lasts longerside was quite small for the x and cool but the quality of the picture wasnt as good and crisp as i was expectingi give it a  stars out of  because i thought it could have been betterill try some other to see if it worst than this and if they worst ill boost this to  starsthe unit is very compact and it comes with a decent pouch
it is easy to fit in a purse or large pants pocket
the magnification is adequate for looking at elevated architectural features but i ended up also buying a pair of the  x  for a few bucks more
i found the  x  pair a better valueok for the money but nothing really special  but do not expect anything great from these but they are ok so that is what i have ranked themi have used the binoculars at a few concerts now
it worked very well at an indoor venue where i had pretty good seats
i could see adam levine perfectly
however at a large music festival it did not work well
i could hardly see the performer and it seemed to focus on people in the crowd rather than the performer
on the plus side it is small and fits in my purse
i would say that the x would be good for concerts where you have really good seats and performances where it is a small venue not a large music festival or if you are way in the backthese are total budget binoculars
focus is not user friendly
forget about it if you wear glasses like me
i usually close one eye and use them as monoculars to spy on birds from my couch
one day ill replace them or give the to my young nephewif you want a decent cheap pair of for kids these work well
if you are looking for a quality lowerprice binoculars i would spend a little more on a different pairif youre looking for a pair that you dont want to lose sleep over losing or having your kid break these are ithaving  vision i find its not easy keeping focus because i have to change both the focus and the diopter on one of the lenses to bring an image into clear focusi wanted a compact and lightweight binoculars and for what they provide this set got great reviews
in practice they are easy to use and they are useful but not a substitute for heavy and long distance binocularsworth  or so
these are just what you pay for
they are not a great bargain but neither are they cheap junk
for an every day carry or knock around in the car or jeep just perfect
when you lose them or your kid drops them in the lake no big deal just buy a new pairtwo suggestions  buy the x it is a lot easier to get past the limitations and the x is hard to keep in focus
also dont look through a good pair of binoculars or you will instantly be  poorer
i have german glass
you wont ever want to look through them without a large credit balance and an understanding spouse
i worked extensively with optics and lenses years ago and the more you learn and experience the more it costs you
and not just a little bit
to get that last bit of quality out of lenses cost  times as muchtrust me you are better off not knowing what you are missingi got these after redaing numerous reviews saying how small and convenient these are
well they are small not convenient
i wear both glasses and contacts
with contacts as in bare eyes i found the eye relief to be a huge problem in getting binocular vision as in both eyes
was mostly getting monocular vision and had to do a lot of adjustment every time to get binocular vision
so no small is not always bettermagnification is really good field of view is poor which i knew
optics are good fully coatedi wouldnt pay retail for these glad i got a marketplace item for the bushnell powerview x binoculars are decent for the sizeprice
for reference you can read a registration plate clearly from about  yards away
youre not going to be able to see craters on the moon but they do work well for a cheap little pair of binoculars
they are fully adjustable width wise and have the focus knob that is easy to use
sometimes i find it easier to use just one eye with the binocularspros compact light easy to carry great pricecons loose eye piece easily slips out of focus forcing user to adjust focus in two different places on the binoculars every time they view a subjective owned these binoculars for at least six months and here is my review
these are a halfway decent pair of binoculars but dont expect a whole lot
they are pretty small and compact
they also come with a nice case to store them
these binoculars can fit in the palm of your hand
i paid like  for mine
i wouldnt pay more than  for these
when i first started using them i was kinda impressed until i found out my digital camera had a better and clearer zoom
these would be ok if your at a sporting event but i wouldnt go bird watching or anything with these
depending on how much your trying to spend would determine if i recommend them
for kids they would be pretty goodthe first pair i ordered the right side had a great focus but the left side just couldnt get past fuzzy
again i dont think its the lenses but how they were installed
without taking it apart i couldnt tell youthe second pair after amazon so nicely replaced the first pair i can just get the right side in focus
but there is no more adjustment to it
left side works finethe reason im giving it such a low approval is that its case doesnt work well
its to small and you struggle each time to get them in or out
if your in a hurry or dont want to take your eyes off of something forget it while its in the caseit also doesnt have a sturdy neck cord to carry them around your neck
recommend replacing the string with something strongerjune  and i found a case for the xs its condor frag grenade pouch
for  bucks
it fits tight and leaves a gap on either side but the top and bottome are totally coveredsplicecondor tactical single frag grenade pouchgood qualityeasy to managecould be a bit lighternot a must have but a good tooli couldnt get this product to focus but this transaction is a testament to the amazing amazon return policy
they put the customer first
they paid for the return of the product and reimbursed my payment 
thanksi thought by taking the cap off and putting them up to the eyes it would be easy to use
neither myself or my wife could see out of them
it took quite a bit of adjusting to make the distance clear
maybe there are better models
this is definitely not the casei really cant tell if the result of double vision is that while they deliver it it felt or just that quality control is poor i really dont know but mine as other reported already came with double vision problems
i heard someone saying its got to be with the alignment of the glass inside and that high power binocular are more difficult to get this alignment done properly but its a waste of my time thank god not of money that because a product is bad i have to spend time on buying this pair of binocular and then send them back
hopefully if you buy them they are good then im pretty sure it will be awesome because i like the power they offer and how much light come through the lens
go ahead and try your luck hopefully even if they are good they last longthis an otherwise excellent binocular and i have the x version and am very happy
however the one x that i received had a somewhat very bad case of blurry lens for me at least but just the left one
so i returned it and got the full refund from amazon including shipping
it took some work to ship it back but it was really a simple and straightforward process which makes me confident buying from amazon again
i ended up buying the pentax x which is excellent but not perfect
the most important thing for me is clarity brightness and sharpness in both eyes of course
so the build is important durability and overall quality if very important but the most important thing is getting a clear sharp image
i believe this binocular can deliver but not my copy
i would like to try another copy but now i have the pentax which so much betteri got the  x  because i saw great reviews on the  x  and thought the extra magnification would be nice
they werent that bad but nothing to write home about
about worth  less than i paid
they arent heavy so that is a plus
the quick focus was nice as well as the rubber grip
would be good for bird watching if you are semiclose to the birds
you hardly get what you pay for here
i might have been expecting too much though
they were very solid and rigidi bought this to use in the fire service
primarily so i can be as far away from a hazmat scene as possible
the magnification is excellent for this purpose
the reason i did not rate it a  or  is the focus mechanism
focus and clarity are very important to me
there are two bars that adjust the two separate rear eye pieces im sure they have a real name near or far focus
the bars are very flexible and it causes the two separate eye pieces to have out of sync focus when they are pressed even slightly
i doubt the extra expense of using inflexible plastic or even metal would add a s much as  to the retail price
as for the glass the clarity is only slightly less than the quality i observed in a  pair of binoculars at the gun store
at this magnification it goes without saying  but i will anyway a mono pod or tripod is necessary to avoid a shaky image
fix the focus and ill give it a i was expecting a better visual field for the binoculars
they are good but not greatthe lens cover is poorly made
the soft store bag has no protection for any force
it not looks like bushnell product any morei bought this used
it worked  but i dont recommend this for mac
the phone company was more than patient and i got it to work only with their help
but a power interruption had me reinstalling it from square one
my internet problems went away when i upgraded to an entirely different system
i havent looked back sinceafter a few false starts i was able to get this router to work great
i am not sure how or why i had problems or how or why the problems went away
i have used it both on dsl and now cable
it works better on cable
i actually have a win  win  win nt and an imac all hooked up to it
the documentation that was included is sketchy at best and the online help is not worth looking up
the hold time for technical support gave me enough time to fix it myself so i guess support did worki bought this for use with my new slingbox and it works perfectly
the only thing is that when i set up the sling box there was a ip address problem where the router did not have the correct setting but it was quickly solved by reviewing all the places where the router needed to check and match ip addresses
moreover it does hide your computer from intruders
however the downside is that it lasted only one year and i had to get a new router
when it works it really works but when it dies its deadprobably a good product id read good things but it sure didnt work to hook up our  mac computers
went through a headache with tech support but in the end it just didnt support mac
returned it and got a dlink instead which worked great from the get go and hasnt given us any problems sincei just bought this router for my new cable internet hookup
it took me  hours to set up  let the software set this thing up for you dont use the quick set up directions any farther than hooking the cables up in the right spots
i had to reset this thing like  times before i got it to start
i hope that if i have any more problems theyll arise within a month so amazon can take this back
for now its good
im just using this as a firewall for now
if i hook it up to another computer ill let you know whether it works
if youre shopping still the reviews are definitely better for the netgear stuff but im keeping my fingers crossed because this was a cheap way for me to get a firewallversion  befsr v has been out for at least  months
if the information is wrong and this is really version  then its a good deal
otherwise find a version  elsewherethe setup was essentially plug and play
i never had to use the included cdrom and i now share my cable connection between two pcs  both running win xp but this unit emits a high frequency whine i dont know which components in it cause this but its quite loud
sounds more or less as a  rpm hard drive when it spins idleif you are trying to make a quiet pc  to use for music playback for example  you might be very disappointed
otherwise the unit is problem freei bought the linksys when my yearold netgear bought the farm i bought that one used so it was actually even older than that
i admit i was lured in by the hot bright blue casing and hightech style years
imagine a product manufactured in this era that lasts that longnow a month later the linksys is doing the same thing my netgear did after  years  intermittent connection
loading some sites but not others
i cant speak to the poor customer service issue from reading all the negative reviews here i can see i would just be setting myself up for all kinds of frustration i dont needback to shopping this time for another netgear
the moral of the story is if a product works stick with the brandedit  the problem actually was with the power cord which would randomly stop working i discovered
any interruption in power between a routermodemcomputer requires painstaking turning offon and waiting to reestablish the setup which didnt happen with the unnoticed power loss explaining my spotty connection
im now using the old netgear cord instead and havent had the problem again knock on woodthis router is absolutely amazing for almost everything except if you download many files  at the same time via napster or cutemx peertopeer exchanges
this router will crash frequently if you are doing that and you will have to reset it  no ifs ands or buts
it will generally crash if data transfers get very busy which is frustratinghowever this router has an impressive list of features like forwarding that allow you to do things like setup www server
 setup ftp server
 setup remote control softwarecombined with dynamic dns services you can host a fairly decent site on the web from your homei used to be a big linksys lover but my experience with several of their products both here and at work where im the it guy makes me seriously think that their quality is suspectmy experience at home is with the befsras far as featureset and stability its great
no problems and the functionality is excellent
im very happy in that regards which is why i gave this a  instead of a as far as quality goes though i have a different experiencei leave these on  hrs a day and have several computers hooked up to itmy first one died unexpectedly after  months
they wouldnt replace it out of warranty but my credit card company did reimburse me the credit card extended warranties do work
so i went an bought another one
 months later it started freezing up and required an unplugreplug
it started happening more and more
so i saw that there was a firmware upgrade i upgraded and it diedso its under warranty and they offer a great exchange policy i know because i had to use it with their wireless router at work  it too just died one day so i will exchange it for another onebut after seeing  of their products die unexpectedly i also purchased their vpn router at work and it stopped working after around  months i can honestly say that i am no longer on the linksys bandwagon hence my foray into netgearso my opinion is that this is a great product until it dieswanted to replace original router but found that the software version of this router did not have the qos option that i wantedi have had this router for just over a year and it has started dropping connections
chatted with customer service who seem to have no clue
but that aside when you are chatting they walk away never to return again
i wonder if their connections dropped too
i would not consider purchasing linksys products againi use this router to support my home network
it is connected to a speedstream  dsl ethernet modem on the wan side and  of my  computers are plugged into it
the uplink port is connected to a netgear ds hub to which my th computer and a netgear ps print server are connected
router performance is satisfactory at this time but i am only starting out with dsli buy linksys and netgear components which for the most part have performed well
there were some exceptions
i quickly realized that both companies have extremely poor technical support
both companies refuse to support operating systems other than windows they must have a contract with microsoft about that
 and putting in a support request of any sort will result in disappointmentso if you buy linksys or netgear components remember you are on your own
dont expect support
you will usually do better to thoroughly read the provided documentation then coldly analyze whether your network falls within the parameters specified by that documentation and what you want it to do
if you dont understand this or that networking issue then dig in and be prepared to learn about it  elsewhere on the internet  and to experiment until you get things right
search off usenet discussion groups for help
always be aware that the component you buy may not be able to do what you imagine it should be doing
always realize that networking components from these manufacturers are not going to work quotout of the boxquot in your particular network configuration because there is always going to be some software configuration you will have to do
the stuff you have to do will influence component performance very heavilyi dont buy these brands because of a superior quality perception
in fact im still feeling my way around networking hardware components and im not terribly skilled with the software side either
both linksys and netgear share a monopoly on the consumer networking hardware market
netgear and linksys products take up most of the shelf space at your friendly compusa storeid like to say one more thing about product support in general
im always amazed at how people will intially send a  or  line support request devoid of crucial details and then become upset that their problem hasnt been immediately fixed
a tech support professional probably sees this type of initial support request  of the time
he or she is forced to ask questions before enough information is accumulated in order to solve the real problem
it is not his or her fault that the customer did little more than say quoti have a problem with your router
fix itquot much more detail is needed for a technical solutionso if you put in a support request  do yourself and the support technician a huge favor
first carefully read the manual again to see if that helps
i promise that  of the time you will find the answer to the easier problems
if you dont take the time to carefully describe the problem and give a good background to it
even then do not expect stellar support from either linksys or netgear
but dont use this as your excuse to be a poor support customer
help yourself and help them by doing your homework and providing important detailsproduct rating support rating  just because there isnt a lower onebuying a linksys product is like purchasing something from frys electronics find what you want and pray it doesnt fail
if it does just burn it and buy something else because dealing with support is not worth the headachethe hardware is wonderful by the wayfirst the router works fantasticonce it is configured correctly
now that is the trick because the buyer has no control over the configuration
allow me to explaini have two laptops and a ps system
i recently upgraded from dial up access coughchokepuke to dsl yay
fast as hell
the company supplying the dsl did not sell multiport modems which is insane in todays technologically crazed society
anyway so i have dsl in place and im attempting to install this router so i can have dsl access for all of my toys
it should be as simple as a plug and play follow the instructions setupit iswas not
i had to call linksys tech support to walk me through a complicated online upgradeconfiguration of their router before i could even use it
this is crazy
whatever happened to follow the instructions and it works
i have installed many it systems through my years of work and have not had any issues setting up routers until nowto linksys credit their tech support was fantastic and they got me up and running in a short amount of time thank you
howevercome onwhy does it have to be this wayhappy holidayssmackathis router set up very quickly and i had three computers networked behind it within  minutes
i also set it up to route secure shell request from the internet to my one linux machine
all great huh
 days later all the lights on it were blinking including power and it was hot to touch
needless to say it didnt work at all and couldnt be reseti replaced it with another so i obviously still think its a good product for the price but i would not use this product where robustness and reliability are requiredi have a stack of these in my basement utility room next to the modem
they work great for about  months and then we start arguing about whose turn it is to reboot the routerthe only problem is i have tried a few other brands and get anywhere from  to  months out of the others
so i buy two of these at a time grin and bear it and always have one ready for when the one in use starts showing signs of giving up  like slow connections dropped connections etc
then we spend a few weeks unplugging it from power for  seconds and plugging it back in again to try to prolong its life
near the end i just swap it out so that the kids can do their homework if im not aroundwhile designed for a purpose this device isnt easy to use and it seemed to be aimed towards a certain community
it will continue to be a part of my collection because that purpose will soon be made availablethese phones are extremely comfortable i love sennheisers new quotbioneticquot design
however these headphones are not what i would excpect for the price
the only genre i was comfortable listening to on them was rock and beyond that i felt the sounds was muddled and not very open
they have a somewhat strange quotsemiopen airequot design which is not standard
if you can afford them the sennheiser hdsare outstanding however for something nearer this price range and usability i highly recomend the grado srsthey are less expensive and sound much betterwhile not being an audiophile i was looking for a pair of decent sounding headphones to wear at work for extended periods of time
i had a pair of koss tds that sounded acceptable but were uncomfortable to wear for over  minutes
these looked quite comfortable and were about what i was looking to spend
at first listen they seemed quite dull favoring the mid to low sections and not at all the bright responsive headphones that i was looking for
then i realized that i was driving them with my laptops internal card
at home it was a different story entirely
the highs suddenly came out and they responded like a decent pair of headphones
i would definitely recommend using these only with a properly driven output device or a headphone amp
also these seemed to bring out the worst in my mp files
all in all only medium performance on typical equipment
better equipment brings out better sound
i hear that the hds are better sounding on typical equipment for the same pricei have two hd headphones and have gotten quite addicted to their lovely rich and incredibly clear sound
they were getting a bit worn however and i have already replaced the cords on both of them
so i decided to try this headphone mainly because the amazoncom review said that the hd was supposed to replace the hdwell the hd definitely has a different sound compared to the hds
the sennheiser website shows a frequency response chart for this headphone that describes it best basically a  dip in the midrange frequencies
and thats what i hear  the highs are quite sharp the lows are definitely there but the middle frequencies just seem to be dulled
and so the sound that comes out of these headphones lacks the rich fullness and ringing clarity of the hds
with the highs and lows both registering fully the sound can be both more shrill and booming at the same time depending whats in the music that you are playing
muffled isnt quite the right word since the highs still come through but yes these headphones sound muffledanyway if you listen to the hd exclusively you can get used to the sound its not as bad as some of the reviews would make it
its only when i do a direct comparison with the hds that i kind of regret getting these headphones
definitely i like the hds sound better but then ive been listening to them exclusively for about ten years or so
finally there is a difference in the volume of the hd
its not horrible but on one computer i have to max out the volume just to get it loud enoughthese are great headphones and extremely comfortable
but to add real life into your music especially out of the confines of the clasical genre grab a pair of sennheiser hdsthe sound those headphones create is near perfection
they are often used as a reference for recording engineers and audiophiles
the extra price is very much worth it
these headphones are great for classical music but if you are primarily a rock listner you might want to check out the grado srs
i would also recommend going and auditioning this type of headphone before you buyid go for the jordana over the palm easily
first of all its got color  a lot faster than the palm color secondly it seems to be a lot more  useful more useful programs
the palm is good for an organizer and you  dont pay as much but the ce machines  seem more like a minicomputer  plus all have the option of flash cards at least to expand the  memorybut if you are going to get a ce machine i say wait and try to  find the compaq ipaq which is hard to find but it is far superior to the  jornada
i bought the jornada originally and many factors caused me to  return it
biggest one was the fact that it wasnt connecting to my pc
the  factors though that caused me to go try the compaq instead of getting  another jordana that worked jornada literally isnt viewable in  sunlight
im truly not exagerating here i thought maybe others were  they werent
i turned it on in sunlight and i thought it wasnt turning on  until i shaded it some and really looked hard jornada doesnt  respond as well to taps the touch screen is not as sensitive
not sure if  this is cause the compaq is faster or the screen is not as sensitive but  it got really annoying
id try to drag something and the slightest change  of pressure it would drop the thing
plus it felt i really had to hit it to  get it to respond
the compaq responds quite nicely to the stylus or even  my finger the jornada had to have something that could create a strong  pressure pointthere are many other reasons to go with the compaq big  noticeable difference in speed more memory all for the same price but  those were the two biggest things i personally enjoy about the compaq the  jornada didnt give me
oh and the ipaq i got came with a  dollar refund  if i also got the flash card reader so you may not be paying more cept for  tax or shipping to get the flash card reader which will read flash card  ii the jornadas doesnt
basically the jornada was nice when there  wasnt an alternative but i bet the compaq quickly phases it outthings that i would say the jornada has the advantage over compaq  case design though some have complained about the jornada being bigger i  really dont see this
it may have bene slightly thicker but it was less  wide and tall and seemed to fit in my purse better plus i didnt need a  case to protect it which adds on size
i liked the flip top and the fact  that it didnt look so toyish like the compaq but looks are superficial  and when it comes to performance the compaq beats the jornada hands down
too bad i couldnt stick the compaq into the jornadas case
the fact  i could tap to get the jornada on
this came with hps settings they have  their own special ones and i think is great
not sure if that would work  for compaq since they dont have a flip cover to keep it from accidently  being tapped
 the stylus
this is personal preference thoughthe  cassopia or whatever the casio one is for me didnt even come in play  its big bulky and having more colors isnt all that important to me
for  those that dont mind size maybe check this one out
i cant help you here  though cause i have never even had the chance to play with it didnt even  seen one store display that workedi call quotsoftware bloatquot  fifteen yards
theres too much unnecessary stuff squeezed into this box
thats obviously why it cant be the size of say the palm v i do not  in any way shape or form  need  all this silly mp and audio stuff on an electronic organizer
what am i  going to plug in my earbud during a meeting
how must pearl jam sound on a  jornada
i dont dare try
im taking the  back i will continue using  my  which i bought  months ago  thanks hp and i will buy a new one  when they can slim it down by losing all the audio silliness
give me an  electronic organizer with the outlook features the omniserve calculator  the word and excel viewers and maybe a simple game or twoyes
not a bad accessory especially considering its price
but it gets scratched and marked very easy
a kind of sacrificesurface that helps protect your jornada screen glass
six sheets will last three or four months i thinkbesides i totally agree with several users on the point that hp could have documented better this accessoryheres my assessment of things i like and dont like about the rio prossmall lightweight no skipping decent sound quality the above apply to pretty much any portable mp player wma support usb interface for fast transfer of songs future support for mb ibm  microdrive possible future aac advanced audio coding support low  pricecons rio audio manager software is extremely cumbersome to use  supplied earphones do not sound good and will have to be replaced you  cannot distinctly discern by touch what button youre pushing on the round  pad
youll end up stopping or pausing tracks when you want to skip to the  next track
only mb ram standard with no upgrades available at this time  larger than previous model rio  no belt clip no recording for fm  tunerthe rio  is your basic mp player
wma support is nice but  because of digital rights management the wma format is difficult to deal  with and im not going to convert all my mps to wma
someone should have  tested the rio s button pad for usability
you cant feel what button  youre pushing and because the rio s body is curvy its hard to  discern updownleftright without looking at it
you also have to use  your fingernail to push the tiny center button or youll accidentally press  on of the updownleftright buttons as wellas of right now i would  recommend the rio  over any other mp player currently available not so  much because its so good in itself but its good when you compare it to  the others
the things i most wish it had right now are memory packs and  better software
im not sure how much the memory pack upgrades will cost  but im hoping that a mb memory pack will not put it in the ballpark of a  rio  which will come with mb standard and have recording  supportthe rio  is cheap but if you get the rio  plan on  spending more money on headphones and a memory upgrade unless you want to  deal with the wma format
faceplates allow you to change the color of the  rio but the standard metallic blue is stylish enough for meill be sending this one back
it sounds great the backlighting is cool  and the usb connection is really fast
i loaded up about  songs at cd  quality in about a minutebut the headphones are insane  small and  irritating to put on and tinny sounding
the  mb is way too small and  the main play button is really poorly designed  sometimes i push the  right button other times i dont  its almost arbitrary
also the lack  of a belt clip was an extreme oversight  i dont want to have to hold  this thing while im on the treadmillwhen the  ships with  mb and  you replace the headphones with something normal id recommend this  player
for the mac its about the only optioni got this to span across my driveway to my snowmobile trailer after the snow plow guy massacred the last one i had
the last cord i have had for some years and do not know the manufacturer but it was orange and stayed very pliable  the same as room temp  in any ambient temps
this coleman cable does serve its purpose  it works as an extension cord  but when i had it running across the driveway for a few days last week in cold winter temps f i was unable to coil it very easily it was pretty much frozen stiff
hope that info helps someone other than the cold stiffness issue its a perfectly good cordpossessing the camera for more than half a year now i could express more objective opinion than the first delights of a newborn digital camera owner
i still consider the camera as a good buy for the money
the resolution is quite enough for me
actually i cant understand the present race for megapixels
in my opinion unless you are a professional photographer you never need more than x
however the picture quality is not adequate
it would be enough for x but for higher resolution you see a lack of contrast sharpness and saturation even for good light conditions
i guess that the optic is just poor
anyway if you need a camera not only for publishing pictures online or emailing them to friends and relatives youd better spend more money and buy something betteralso the battery life is too short
you should always switch off the batteries if not using the camera a day or more instead of removing them i insert an old postit plastic flag under the lid to open the circuit
the provided software is really ridiculous
fortunately all you actually need is just a twain driver to transfer images from the camera to your favourite software
you can specify this during installationi read a good many reviews before selecting the dlink nic card
i found the install easy and trouble free but the quality isnt what id expected
the rj connection is poor cable doesnt lock in and ive lost my  connection several times having to remove the card to get a proper  connection
this may well be a faulty card but i can only speak from my  experience with the one which thus far has not been greatbut after several months of owning it i am noticing some things i dont likeprospocket pc operating system is wonderful
it is just like windows and has everything windows has to offer in a little tiny version
i am a programmer and love the ability to connect to databases with this productmp
what else do i need to say about that
wonderfuldocument library a specially designated place tos tore ebooks was a wonderful ideascreen crisp and clean
perfect clarity much better than the sonysconsbattery life very short
i need to recharge fully every night and do a restore as the battery dies throughout the daysize very bulky
in todays marketplace i find it hard to believe this model cannot be more compact
warning this barely fits in the coach miniofficelack of accessories try to find a hardcase for this model
yikes
without it your ipaq will turn on on its own draining the battery even moresorry  i am a radio collector and wonder how one can be fully satisfied with this one
am reception is worst of all my recent purchase  sony sharp kaito sangean  all are miles better
while fm is ok am is sub standard  and having a mono headphone jack one ear reception is not making it better
recommended only of you are living in an area where your favorite stations are very strong
i give it i bought this at amazoncom after reading good reviews
the one i have is mono and not stereo and you use it with earbuds or rather only one earbud
you can also use with earbudson the beach you get much static and not great sound qualityit replaced a coby that had great sound but broke within a relatively short period of timethe good old  transistor radio
thats what you get here
for that its nicethe panasonic rfp is  tall  wide and  thick
fits in a jacket or jeans pocket
too tall for a tshirt pocket
its contoured nicely with no sharp corners
it runs on two aa batteries and i can get about  hours of constant use out of rayovac alkalinesassuming youre looking at the face of the radiothe left side has the on  off dial which is also the volume dial
under that is the audio jack which is monoaural only
this means that with headphones or earbuds youll only get sound out the left ear
if you want sound out of both ears buy a mm female mono to mm male stero adapter for three dollars
right above the volume dial is the wrist strap
its a simply nylon cord about  long
in the rear of the left side is the antenna
it folds out but doesnt swivel
it extends to  longthe right side has the tuning dial underneath that the am  fm band selector switch
the back of the radio has the battery compartment
the speaker built into the p is  in diameter and projects sound from the front
its not too tinny and is decent for the price
the product description lists two leds one for signal strength and one for battery life
i cant find the battery life led
its nowhere on the radio and nothing pops up when the radio is in use to indicate battery life
the signal strength led marked tuning on the front does work but is a little deceptive it lights up when you have a strong signal but it gives no indication of the clarity of that signal
so you could get a perfectly good signal but its not clear enough to make anything outthe fm on this radio is acceptable but the am is just garbage
in the basement on the porch in the backyard or in the car all get the same abysmal results on am
the am band maxes out at khz
the tuning dial is a little stiff making it easy to skip past the channel you wantas a whole the p is okay
i like the size and everything except the am is so bad it brings the rest of the good features down
for  the sony icfs mk or kaito ka are betteri guess its ok in a pinch
but i cant get radio station signals in most areas and get a lot of static if i dont play with the position
also dont expect to plug in your stereo headset and hear stereo youll only hear from one ear even if your on the fm diali went back and forth on this radio with the sony
based on the reviews i got this one
the battery life is super long
i use this for camping and have had it on many hours
ive even left it on over night to still have going in the morning and am still on the st set of batteries
the only complaint i have is sometimes the reception will start to get staticy for no reason
i have dialed it in and after a few minutes or a an hour or whatever it will start to go out
sometimes it will hold for hours and sometimes i cant keep it locked on for more than a few minutes
not sure if this is because im in the woods when i use it or not
its like that annoying radio that is in tune and as soon as you take your hand away it goes out
frustrating
but like i said not all the time and for  bucks what the heck
you decideupdate okay so after trying several other radios kaito k ccrane solar observer i feel like panasonic did not really step up with this product as much as it could have the reception on this product is not as good as it could have been
if you want something with a better reception get a portable sony the red ban on the dial is tilted sideways
i dont know if it is only my product but it gets pretty annoying after whileotherwise if you care about a decent fm radio and okay am radio then this a product for you
however given that sony icfs has much better reception and is cheaper then there is no reason to go with panasonic
unless of course you like the looks in that case panasonic might be the winnerso my first impression was  this radio looks quite nice
i like the size to sound quality compromise
the speaker is entire width of the radio
the size of the radio is large enough to give good sound and small enough to fit into back pocket and use it outside
the fm reception is good enough for the radio to be used with antenna retracted
the antenna is also screwed in so if you do break it you can simply attack a copper wire for replacement
and you wont be shipping the radio under warranty because shipping is more expansive than the radio itselfas for am reception it is also very good i pick up tons of stations in nyc and most of them clearly
there is a little red diode that indicates when you have maximum signal strength its quite useful
the battery life is like most small radios amazingquality control seems good
there is no loose parts no dents and no scratches
the only downside is the red station indicator
its not mounter perpendicular to the analog dial
this is quite annoying because whenever i change stations it flops to the right a little bit
im not sure if this is quality control issue or by design there is only one string pulling it left or righti ordered this radio as as a backup for the sony icfsmk which i already own
i listen to the radio a lot often news and sports and hate having ear buds in my ears while i like the design of the panasonic alot better its smaller and looks more modern this radio does not have the reception that the sony icfsmk does
in fact stations i get with ease on the other radio were difficult to find on this one
also the am sound  quality is very muffled
the little wheel that pulls in the stations is difficult to turnif there werent a better alternative i imagine that this would be a good enough cheap little radio
if you are trying to decide between the two go for the sonyi have to remember i bought this for when the power goes out
i do use it almost everyday though
its my morning bathroom noise maker this is like something out of the s
was looking for something more stylish
but then i had to say to myself we are looking for something practical
practical it is stylish like i said like my grandmothers onsee bathing suit
it gets the job donei wanted a small radio with a speaker having given up on wearing headphones carefully read the reviews and got the sony smk and this panasonic rf p
both are what i remember as about  transister radios although both are probably printed circuits by now
the sony is much less directional than the panasonic when placed in an almost dead reception area of my office and brought in clear programs  miles from the transmitter while the panasonic had to be carefully placed to get a similar soundits a great basic recorder and works in that capacity very well
i had bought for converting my cassettes to mp format and for that it simply isnt up to the task
it only has a single output instead of separate channel rca jacks for left and right making anything i try and convert go from stereo to monotone
other than my haste in purchasing it is a solid unit for the priceeither no erase head or it doesnt workof course if i want to add parts to a recording perhaps that might be good if i was able to figure out the precise timingthere was virtually no static in the recording and great volume in the playback so in that regard it is much superior to some other cassette recorders i have
i am resigned to perhaps check if i can erase via the other recorders enough so that this one can then rerecord on some of those tapes later another flaw is the buttons are very quirky or flimsy  they tend to look like they are sticking in the down positioni am glad that it does not autoreverse because that on other recorders has destroyed some tapes by accident the low cost meant to me that it wasnt worth the hassle to return it even if i didnt want it
and since i need this noiseless feature so much i am putting up with iti am currently running it off ac
i havent tried off of batteries yet although that is allowable supposedlyi have had two radio shack playerswhich didnt  hold up unfortunately so i thought the panasonic would be better and i expected the same features ie
one called aux which i use to connect my radio with a cable to the tape recorder and can tape off programs
it did not come with that feature so it is not useful for my main purpose
it has a spot for a microphone but that was not provided
i didnt care about that anywayi bought a set of these for someone that has problems wearing earbuds iem as well as staying away from my jvchafxb
these phones are perfect for the pc or laptop if youre looking for a quick and simple device to catch newsfeeds or watching tutorial videos
please note that these are not noisecanceling headphones but for the price with shipping you really cant go wrong and they are pretty comfortable around your earsabout the phonesworks well with computers but i wouldnt recommend tagging it along with your portable music device  such as an ipod
the reason being is that they do not do a very good job of suppressing or isolating sounds which means you can still hear ambient noise and people sitting around you can also hear them
the earcups are designed at an angle facing inwards from the front shaping your ears and out towards the rear this is good for people with flappy ears but not for me and probably the majority
to get the full sound id have to press and hold them in flat the xbs bass effect works well but all other frequencies quickly becomes muddled and surely one cant be doing this all along while wearing itin retrospect sound quality is decent from a scale of  to  being best id say  you can hear the bass but you wont feel it it is there only not as rich and tight
the trebles could be better if it werent for the mids being a bit too high which resulted to somewhat of an overall flat sounding deviceback to the design as i mentioned before the angledcup design could be a small problem to some people
it is certainly for me because this also reduces the overall volume decibel compared to my uberrich soundingjvc hafxbwhich at  volume level i get a fairly high sound decibel as apposed to  level with the panasonic
also i didnt like the angle plug this could be a plus or minus to some
the reason when its plugged in to my nano next to its charging socket the angleplug prohibits me to lay the nano down on a flat surface or id have to swivel the plug opposite but itll stick up in the air see my photos
in case youre asking it cant be swiveled to the sides because it is very tight with the charger plugged in if i try it will bend and damage the socket and phone jack plugsprosprice price and price under  bucksfree shippingdecent soundbass okay but not rich or tightconsear cup designangled plug may or my not be for othersflat soundingsound escapes even at decent volume levelsi wish i had a better rating
i guess it is a little unfair
the headphones themselves are amazing
the bass is really good with songs
but unlike someone elses comment which swayed my decision to purchase a little it is not a good size for even kids
i have a really small head and these do not fit me
plus i have tmj and somehow it squeezes my jaw and it hurts after a few minutes
ouch
so be aware when buying these that you are sure about the size
they extend quite a bit
so i think the issue is having a really small head
although i am not sure about the other extreme having a really big head
ha
i guess the same issue would arise
i have no idea
i wish my head were bigger and my jaw was not so messed up these are really great headphones otherwise
but from my experience alone i have to give a lower rating booo
loli bought both the panasonic and the jvc with the intention of keeping both if they were about the same
i already have the sennheiser pc ii which i use daily for skype  gotomeetingfirst thing that turned me off about the panny is it just doesnt feel right on my head
i even tried wearing it backward just to make sure but of course that didnt work
i could have kept it even though its sound is a little weak compared to the jvc but the fit just completely turned me offthe jvc is much louder like twice as loud and offer a much better fit even though the cups are a little smalli ended up returning the panasonic as it just doesnt feel right on my head
and will keep the jvc for my dj purpose since it fits easily in my u rack drawer and its loudnessthey sound decent with adequate bass and overall good sound
they dont cup my ears properly or tightly enough but sound ok despite that
definitely worth the money or up to the sound quality of these headphones is appreciably lower than that of my old sven headphones bought for 
nevertheless i agree with many reviewers that this is one of the best cheap headphones currently available at amazondoes the job i use it on my computer not good for quality sound for music and such blah blahi bought two of these headphones for my kids to use on a crosscountry car trip so i wouldnt be driven witless by sounds of whatever they were watching
its not a bad thing for parents to want to listen to their own music or the radio in the car but the rules of parenting these days can try to make you feel like youre terrible for not wanting a full immersion of childhood all over again
we checked out the volume on these and with the noise of the car they were not uncomfortably loud
they are a little big for younger kids but better to have than the earbuds i thinkthis is a good headset at a very reasonable price
not the most comfortable fit but still a good bargainthe title says it all
these are affordable and perfect for kids
if they are destroyed its not a big loss
but if you are really into music and want a set of headphones that reproduce a full range of frequencies these are not it
they produce very little bass and have limited high frequency responsei am quite unusual as i sleep with headphones and a radio
the original sony bass headphones were nice and flat and comfortable to wear at night on my ears
these headphones are bulky and the sound quality just isnt there
for me theyre okay but for someone else out there that just wants to listen to music and doesnt sleep with their headphones they would probably be okaybought these to replace an older pair that the ear pads had worn out
was somewhat disappointed after receiving them because when i attempted to use them in my samsung mp player the dongle would not transmit sound unless you played around with it
once it did start transmitting sound it was inconsistent and would have be readjusted
just my experience ymmvill admit to a hearing loss
however with all but dollar store quality headphones i can get all the noise i need
these dont produce sufficient volume pushing them close to the sound level of  items
when i do jack up the mp player to near its limits draining the battery these produce a respectful smooth sound way beyond their price
if you dont mind upping the volume by about  these are a solid deal
for me these wont replace any earbuds or headphones that i already hadfor what i needed ie
parts to fix another pair of headphones they worked fine
quality is ok sound is descent but you get what you pay forgood product but the cord is way too short if you plan to use it with a computer that sits more than a couple feet from you
it would be nice to have an adjustable volume control on the cord tooi purchased these because my wife wont wear ear buds and i wasnt willing to lay out big bucks for earphones that would be used on one vacation and then left in a drawer for years
the quality is fine but there is no noise blocking or cancellation so we had to turn up the volume to drown out background noise
if i planned on using headphones more often id buy a better pair but these suited our needsi guess you cant criticize sound quality too much on headphones that retail for 
for the record though these rphts are slightly below par compared to the similar headphones that came with my  panasonic slsx mp cd player sounding a bit less strong and detailed
also the foam padding flaked off quicker and i find the earbuds to be angled inward a few degrees too far falling short of a perfect fitso yes there is some degree of variance in basic headphones even of the same size and brand
undemanding ears should find them perfectly fine though and if they fit you better than me its easy to call them a good deali needed to provide multiple headseats for podcasting applications
this works well and the price is right
if i needed something rugged and durable this would not suffice  but for the purpose its finethese actually have a really nice sound to them out of  sets of headphones i got at the same time  koss jbuds they were pretty close to being the bestboth in sound and comfort
unfortunately the connection to my sansa clip isnt great
its the only set that has an l shaped plug and i dont know if that has anything to do with it but if i move around at all there is static or loss of volume or bothgot to use with the sandisk sansa clip
it was for my elderly aunt
good sound but hard to adjust to her head so it will stay in place
need a smaller one i guessbought these to use with my desk top computer to enable me to listen to youtube videos while the grandchildren are asleep
they are fine for this purpose
not really super quality sound reproduction but they suit my purposes well
i recommend them for such purposeused the koss porta pro for the last  months and was pleased until the wires frayed
looking for a replacement i came across the panasonic rpht and figured for  how can i lose
theyre ok  nonflexible headphones sit funny so i had to turn them around to use
uncomfortable after wearing for more then an hour
like the title says  spend  and you get  worth of headphonesits  head phones for i need them and they work fine for my daughters dvds player but they will probably break at first sign of strainits not badbass is quite strong for the most part
it lacks the brilliant highs im used to but i could use them as my main pair of headphones if i were forced toi needed a very inexpensive overear headphone set for my  year old to use at school computer lab
this works well for that
at five samoleans how can you go wrong
and the headband design is easy for him to put on and fits his head okay
but personally as an adult i would not want to use these for music
overall they sound quite poor especially on fine acoustic or classical music
though on lighter fare like pop music the bass is surprising strong and pleasant
im not sure how the bass can be so wonderful yet the overall fidelity sound like a tinny am radio
i could probably use these for tasks or as a study aid like for spoken language lessons audio books transcription listening to lecture recordings  i guess anything but good musicif you need something cheap and easy to take on and off and fine to throw in your bag and not worry about losing these are for you
if you want decent sound not reallytheyre lightweight and comfortable but their sound is a bit less crisp than the sony mdrlps which to be fair cost more
still these are decent generic computer headphones fine for listening to youtube videos and suchthey do the job but are nowhere near as good as the koss portapros i have used for years
guess i have been spoiled
just dont expect them to behave like the high priced spreadi cannot say that these are top of the line headphones but they werent advertised that way
they are inexpensive headphones that work and do what i expected out of them
im glad i purchased themi gave these a  star rating but only because of the low price otherwise a  or proslightweight but what headphones in this class arent
cheap  but what   top band and slider rails appear to be made of hdpe plastic which is more flexible wont become as brittle over time to reduce  of areas likely to break and yet the top band would be even more durable made of spring metal and then it could hold an adjustment for optimal tension to suit your head sizefair amount of bass for the cup size and price not especially boomy not out of control bass trying to make up for the shortcomings of a small driver and thinlight low volume plastic cupsfair cord length for portable use ought to be  shorter for that but the extra  might help if your source is in a bag rather than a pocket nearer your head plug doesnt stick up as far on portable players so they seem less bulky and theres less stress to the headphone jackfairly conservative design no silly colors or shapes for niche artistic styling that not everyone would like rather than the purpose of headphones
they dont look as cheap as some in the same price classfoam cushions are a little higher density than some letting them sit closer to your earsyou wont care much if you break them or if they are stolen except then you have no cans till you find a replacementconslightweight  they have that empty tin can sound accentuating upper midrange and they could have put a bit more plastic into the pieces that hold the cups only the adjustment sliders for more durabilityno strain relief on the wires where they exit the cups
if you coil your cord up for storage during portable use you will find this to be one of the early failure modesclunky size adjustment the notches in the hdpe rails are large and hdpe doesnt mold into distinct notches as well as other plasticspremolded angle on cups seems a little large compared to many cans if your ears dont stick out a lot you may find they dont sit as flush against your ears as many cans despite the slight amount of swivel present which results in loss of hearing much of the lower midrange and basswhile the bass is fairly controlled for this price  their marketing dept
fails with the feature xbs port because the bass is fairly poor relative to almost any even slightly larger cupped cans
small light and portable is good but if you can accept an ounce of weight and a few millimeters size increase there are huge bass improvements to be had on cans with only slightly larger cups and yet the price on those goes up some tooalthough they are inexpensive it would only cost a few cents more to make them more durable and improve the sound quality
this seems like a false economy to me my body and gear weigh dozens of pounds so why is shaving fractions of an ounce off their weight so important
it isnt this is just about saving a few cents in manufacturing cost at the expense of the aforementioned detailsoverallits tempting to pick a product based on the lower price but often you only get what you pay for
yes you could pay the same for inferior cans but dont let some of the more positive reviews fool you these dont sound good at all relative to cans costly only a few dollar more
they sound only slightly better than any  generic cans you can find anywheredespite all the pros i listed they just dont meet the core purpose of providing good audio
it is distracting how terrible they sound
to be fair i would write the same about any  cans ive ever heard but on most i didnt see so many positive reviews that misled me into hoping these were different when they arentfor a reference point many consider me an audiophile
my standards seem to be higher than average but im not an elite snob about certain makes and models
ive owned many a pair of cans and build some of my own audio gear and modify the rest
even so i am not trying to compare these against  cans let alone more costly pairs
they just dont sound good enough to use even if they were free unless youre only listening to audible books or similar voice
i would have returned them except that they are so inexpensive that it wasnt worth the botherone problem ive had with a lot of headphones is the wiring from the audio jack connection to the ear pieces seems to come loose
some headphones have been a little more durable than others
these seem about average in durability so far and the sound quality is okay though nothing remarkable
if youre an audiophile obviously youd want to look at other options
but for the average listener who wants an inexpensive pair of headphones these are okayscratchy uneven sound
plug does not fit snugly into a regulr mm jackthey are very lightweight and comfortable but uneven sound quality gives them starsi have been using these headphones for  months
they are comfortable and durable
i am using them in my sangean dt radio
the cord is about  feet long so you can put the radio in your pocket and still havde plenty of length remaining
the headphones are adjustable to fit various head sizes
i have worn them over a hat
the main disappointment is the sound level
the stereo quality is adequate but i have to turn up the volume on my radio to almost full to get a suitable listening level when outside to compensate for outside noise traffic etc
by comparison my sony earbuds give the same sound volume at  of the sound level on my radio
these headphone have a high impedence level  ohms
could this be the cause
im not an electronics expert but i have not seen this high of an impedence on other headphonesto conclude the headphones were very cheap
less than 
for the money they are a good buy
if you intend to use them for talk radio or listening to sports they will done fine
if you intend to listen to music then i would invest in better qualityand by pinch i mean your favorite headphones have bit the dust and you need a new pair to get you by until you can replace the ones that died
the problem isnt so much with the fit as it is with the static
yes i pushed the plug in all the way
it clicked
there was no silver showing anywhere
and yet there was still static problems everytime the plug was even slightly bumped
i knowyou get what you pay forand to be honest i didnt expect koss quality out of a pair of panasonic cheapiesbut i expected them to be better than they were
as to how to resolve the plug issue i have no ideai just know that the design currently used is not a good one
if you buy these i hope you have a better experience than i didi would not buy these again for my computer lab
they are easy to break uncomfortable to wear and just feel cheap
they were cheap so i cant complain but they just didnt hold up under the abuse of the students in my labi purchased  of these for my two children  and  for some small netbooks i have that they like to use to play games or for a portable dvd player when we travel in the car
they like the fit and feel of the headsets on their smaller heads vs the plug style headphones
one of the two has broken already after about  days
the issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which when pulled out from the netbook or dvd player it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connectioni ordered a replacement because the kids like them
the kids like them and the price is right
i have tried to get them to be more careful with the plugs but i dont think it is their hands pulling on them as much as the design
they are adequate and serve a good purpose for usi have the speck pixel skin for my iphone  i have to take it off before plugging this headphone in because i guess the jack is too big and the pixel skin only allows for thin jacks which is annoying i guess
i have plenty of other headphonesearbuds and only this pair of headphones seemed to have this issue
in terms of sound dont get your hopes up in blocking environment noise but the sound quality itself is goodthese headphones are uncomfortable for me
if you are looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones i find the koss kph much more comfortable with similar soundsound seems ok but the plastic loop is for a childs head i think
they push on my ears pretty hardthese headphones were low price and did the basic job okjust didnt last long
something failed and i have no idea whatjust know they turned into junk quite earlyyou know what youre getting into when you buy these
they get the job done and are really cheap albeit a bit dorkylooking
id suggest a decent pair of earbuds over these but they sound fine and keep outside noise where it belongsgood comfortable basic headphones but after using them for a month i would not recommend them for music
the audio quality is less than expected and does not have much range especially bassthese headphones are ok  the sound is decent but i keep feeling like theyre gonna fall off my head
so not so good for running for me
they do do fit into my iphone and a generic mp player
i dont get the sense that they are really sturdy
im gonna buy some over the ear phones as these on the ear earphones are just not working for megood for speech or other non music uses
plastc headband not very comfortable for extended use
low price makes this headset disposable and worth buying
probably good for kids usesthe quality of sound is acceptable considering the low price
however the headpiece that connects the two ear pieces does not adjust to a small enough size for me  and im not a small headed person
consequently it tends to slip off at the gym
if you wear a hat or have a lot of hair they will likely fit you fineall i can say is you get what you pay for and these headphones were especially cheap 
they reminded me of the ones that came with the old portable cd playersmy biggest complaint is that they dont fit snug on my head so the sound volume is very low
the earpiece is made of foam padding
if i press the ear cups to my ear the sound is ample and very clear
but i wouldnt want to hold my hands in that position for very longi plan to invest in a good full sized set of headphones to get the fit i want
i am not concerned too much about portability since i usually listen to music in my recliner
if i were into aerobics i would probably stick to ear buds
for my listening pleasure i would prefer padded ear cups that surround the ear and keep out noiselikesprice for  including sh you cant get better headphone than this
this is really a  headphonegood audio quality
see good for belowdislikesheadphone is a little uncomfortable to wear due to the rough edges on the crown
oem could smooth out the rough edgesneed to increase audio volume to compensate headphones lower than average volume outputgood forregular home tv talk show audio book news programmingbad forhigh quality music appreciation eg
classical acoustic jazzoutdoor activities uncomfortable to wear during workoutconclusioni could buy another pair given the high quality to price ratioafter a few years one of the speakers has gone out
but hey it was only  bucks
has lots of bassi paid  for these
as  headphones well these are actually pretty damn good
these things cant compete with better quality headphones such as my old sony mdrvs which are no longer available at reasonable prices sadly but they sound alright and are comfortableif you are looking for a cheap pair of headphones that dont go in your ear and you wont feel bad about when you or your kid inevitably breaks them this is a good buy
if you are looking for audiophile headphones why are you looking at  headphonesgot two pairs of these as cheap ones i dont care if break or get lost
better sound then buds and can put a little bass
a little
but more then buds will
worth having as sparesthese were christmas gifts for my daughters  and  i have little experience with these they worked when i got them and you cannot beat the pricethey work but the construction suggests that theyll fall apart in a few months
theyre sitting on a shelf in my closet because they arent big enough to comfortably fiti like the sound i get from these headphones
i just dont like how they squeeze my head while the speakers turn toward the back of my head
i want them to fit on my ears not turn outward toward the back of my head
the back of my head isnt listening to the music my ears are
ill have to look into modding these a bit
good sound bad design not comfortablethey are too light and dont really hold well on your ears but they are decent for the price and has a longer cable them mostcant have superhigh expectations given the price but theyre not as comfortable as id hoped or as other cheap sets have been
still they work and sound finei searched for folding headphones in electronics relevance
these were number two in the resultspanasonic rpht lightweight headphones with xbs portsurprise
if they are folded  most likely they are broken
mine do not fold
that was over  of what i needed these headphones for
i needed to be able to slip a small pair of headphones that fit on the head  over the ear inside of my tote bag for use with my ipod  iphonei pretty much have everything in the tote sans the kitchen sink at this time and i did need something small to fit inside of the totesooooo  for the price i paid less than a full lincoln i will be keep themit would cost more to return the headphones in postage than to keep themmaybe i can give them away to someone that needs a pair in a hurry  does not have time to stop at a store or just needs a pair of headphonesothers have given these headphones great ratings on sound
i cannot give a review about the soundthis review is not about the soundthis is about a pair of headphones that were purported to have a feature that they obviously do not havei will say that they feel very lightweight in the packaging look comfortable to wearthe style  color are nice
their appearance is attractive  fairly up to datethese headphones are not a pair i would be ashamed to be seen wearing in publicthey are nice lookingso if you are looking for a nice fairly stylish comfortable pair of earphones to buy for an exceptionally low price i can recommend thesefellow reviewers almost  gave them either a four  or five  stars so they have a high approval rate by other consumersmy main reasoning for writing the review was to spare another person from buying these headphones under the mistaken impression that they will fold downif that is an important feature in your purchase choice look for another pairi want to save someone the time and in the current economy the expense of a purchase that will not meet those needsamazon as always in my experience service  speed of shipping  packaging gets five stars for their end of the purchase  transactionhappy st patricks day to allthese are a great not to big or to small the only down side is i used them only a couple times and found that i had static in my ears when i moved aroundbroke like all the rest of my headphones break
i must have bought ten types of headphones
they all break inside the wiring somewhere if you own a socket  motherboard and only have a  compliant slotalthough it says  this will be the only option you have of the higherend video cards
however  sample antialiasing is the only real advantage of this card to your older d cards
as far as frame rates my tntnon ultra performs almost as well in ultima ascension but has screen tearing and other ugliness where as the voodoo  allows me to use lower res and x antialias and looks about  times better
turn down the clips and youve got a good game
as for quake iii their is choppiness and sound stuttering in heavy fightslike voyager elite which uses quake iii engine baldurs gate ii does not work any better than any other card ive chosen but thats probably my lowend amd k  mhz and lowsy  compliance only agp mother
allin all if you got a raw deal of a mother like i did get this card itll solve your problems you can play your old d fx and newer titles of  bit as well
it doesnt work on redguard thoughreview update 
this is writen after the discontinuation but hopefully voodoo  will be back on the market
still  starsi have put this thing to work
it heats up even with the twin fans
it is noisy and it should only be used in atx style cases
if you are planning on buying a new system dont even bother with this thing get a geforce its expensive but its well worth it
if however you are stuck with a  agplow voltage this is the only card in the known universe that will work on your system
their are no tnt ultras no geforce sexcept that one on this site that is over priced last years computer upgrades have been discontinued and abolished
makes me sick  an at case will need extra coolingodviously i have a slot exhaust fan and a frontal mini case fan on orderhopefully when i recieve these things my case will be able to use the voodoo and it will work for more than two friggn hours before blacking out
my baby at case is unusually large long so it might not work in yours measure it
like i said with the geforce ddrdvi  do not overclock the voodoo  it is hot
it is dangerous
and besides that it is already fast
in my opinion it is already overclocked and runs diablo ii satisfactorially on a lowend system
ultima also runs quite well at this time
as for elite forcequake iii heck my radeon  gts cannot run that game with my pc either
again you need a  agphigher voltage to video card
in the case of running a quake iii engine or a bgii infinity engine well
your  should work with the voodoo on other gamesi wear progressive bifocals and that might be the issue here
i cannot focus these well enough to see the birds in my yard really close from  to  feet away
my son however does like them and he doesnt wear glasses
i do better with my  zoom lens on my camera albeit its heavy
and its auto focusbushnell is the premier maker of binoculars
in this case these were advertised as having auto focusing  which are actually manual
in the end they were light weight and magnified as expectedi purchased these to go and watch my ers beat the brake off of the saints last year and they worked fine for thathowever im a big guy over lbs  and i played football so i think im above average in strength and after wearing for a few hours i definitely knew i had something on my neck and a couple hours after that my neck was hurting so if you are smaller than i am then you probably dont want to carry these around your neckit does work for the purpose i got it but then when i use the lens cover to prevent them from getting scratched it keeps coming off loose
not sure if i will come back to this product
thought bushnell was a quality product producing company hmmwhile this camera takes decent pics the battery life is inexcusable
my duracell lasted  days
the icons buttons and menus do not come naturally
leave it to canon to make you buy the essential rechargable battery separately
from now on i stay with sony
everything makes sense and the battery lasts foreveri tried the hp jornada  for a day or two and returned it in favor of keeping my rim blackberry   ive had every generation of ce device plus a number of palms latest is palm vx
ive found both to be much too big too difficult to communicate with and too pullyourinformationoriented for easy use and onbody transport especially when a wireless modem is added
the blackberry has a builtin qwerty keyboard and wireless modem and is about the size of a palm vx
the jornada similarly outfitted with an omnisky modem and targus keyboard approaches the weight of a small laptop occupies nearly as much space and costs nearly as much
the palm vx similarly outfitted is nearly as heavy large and costly
couple lightness and small size with the rims ability to automatically accept email pushed from isp pop or microsoft exchange servers and youve got a near ideal goanywhere communication tool
add goamericas web access service and you can even browse the interneti appreciate all of the nice features of the jornada but trying to build a laptop into a quot by quot case leads to too many compromises that for me outweigh the nicitiesi should note that the screen of the jornada flickered when the omnisky modem was transmitting or receiving
most likely due to the fact that the modem and the jornada share the power in each of their batteries with each other
that was the deal breaker that led me to return the jornada and the omnisky modemor those who shun manuals
i am a fairly computersavvy person but this handheld was difficult to use out of the box for me
the synchronization process failed numerous times initially
then i downloaded the windows xp update but that was not a fix
i had to reset all factory defaults ie
wipe out all stored data amp pgms and then resynch with the xp software on my pci still have problems with  memory management but i think this is a part of the toosteep learning curve on the  in addition the processor can be maddeningly slow for some tasks like opening a low resolution  megapixel photo file
this sluggishness is also apparent when multitasking like reading mail while running mps in the background often requiring a soft reboot reset
the good things are the price expandable storage i have a  card for music and  for pics sturdy build and excellent graphics
im not sorry i bought it i just wish i had more time to learn its intricaciesthough im glad there is a lowpriced competitor on the palm os there are i few things id consider before buying this
they are not deal breakers but for some users it may make a difference
does not work on win  nt without the serial cable   this is also true from macos  or below
no faceplate included
screen scratches are very apparent within weeks unless you buy a case
there are multiple reviews that describe broken glass and its overly fragile screen
the handsprings seem to use batteries at a much faster rate that palms
im not sure why
stylus is remarkably cheap and less usable
it makes a bizarre scraping noise
mg is fine at first
but if you are at all interested in going beyond the basic calender address books note pad functions then get the models with the extra memory
vindigo free zagat restaurant and updated movie listings and avantgo free newspapers and magazines in electronic formats will use the space and take your palm experience to a whole new level
if you live in a major city vindigo alone makes it worth owning a palm
the expandability doesnt seem to be worth much right now amd bys the time it is im sure youll have moved onto another model
ive poked around other reviews and have yet to find anyone who has gotten much value or use of additional modulesnet net
with the current palm discount i would seriously consider the iiixe for users that a want a more durable and usable unit b want the extra memory at a relatively low cost
if you have to buy an adaptor see reason  they end up costing the same
either way enjoy your pdai got a handspring because it was cool
it has the cardslot springboard which is a little limited in what has actually come out for it but its a good designthe deluxe model has mb and this was a good price for an mb palmpilot with an upgrade slot plus cool colorswith the nondeluxe model this is dropped to mb
its only purpose in life was to be a cheaper replacement for the palm iii and earlierthen i realized the problem
the os is in rom not flash
the os on these are palm v which is about a year old
there is no upgrade path to palm os 
to upgrade you have to buy a whole new oneeven if you could youd have to wait for handsprings versioni recommend the palmiiixe its the same thing minus the springboard module only really useful for a few things which are easily worked around
palm xe has mb and flash rom plus it comes with palm os  and is upgradable
if you need the cellphone or wireless option there are sleeves that fit over the pilot that do thisi have had my visor deluxe in blue for about    years
well i should say it is   years since i received my first visor
i am on my th
it is a joy to use
easy to input data grafiti is easy to use the layout is simple the included software is intuitive to use and the usb connection is so simple to set up even i could do itbut  the first one the case cracked along the back after about one month the second one the screen went bad after three weeks the third one the case cracked and now i am on the th and it has a cracked case
i am not at all rough on the unit
i keep it in a case place it in my desk draw at work and keep it out of harms way in general
i have never dropped one
the three with cracks all developed cracks in different placeshandsprings customer service has been fantastic and they have happily sent replacement units each time
but one must consider the durability of something that is designed to set in the palm of your handif i do by another pda soon i will purchse one with a metal case like the plam vx or the visor edgei have to say i come from the world of windows ce so the handspring visor deluxe was my first attempt at a palmos operated pda
my decision to buy it was mainly due to the following reasons its price
it was the cheapest selling pda where i found enough memory mb for most of my needs the fact that it had a usb cradle
equivalent palm pdas came with a serial cradle which take forever to synchronize the usb cradle being optional yes i have to admit thati thought it looked cool
however i became majorly dissapointed when i realized two things the palm os crashed at least  times on me over the course of only two months
with windows ce i never saw this happensecond and most important there is no sychronizing application neither the one that comes with the visor nor any other third party solution that does a very simple thing allow what i like to call a differential sychronization
what this is is the ability to synchronize only those events or contacts or emails etc
that have changed or are new
with any software for synchronizing your visio or any palm as a matter of fact to your outlook or any other emailcontactscalendaretc
program you use you have to wait until all the items you have in both sides synchronize as if it were the very first time youre doing itas you may realize this is very ineffective specially if youre on the run or have too many items to synchronizethis is mainly why i recently sold it and i am on my way back to getting a pocket pc formerly known as windows ce pda
only reco about pocket pcs stay away from casio they just dont know the meaning of customer servicei will try to drop a word or two about this in a review about their cassiopeia emoving to an area that doesnt have palm vii coverage i decided to buy a smaller amp lighter unit that had more ram and better battery life
maybe it isnt fair to compare the visor to a palm that cost twice as much but here are the issues that ive had with the visor during the first month difficulty installing usb driver on windows  blew up during install
took some searching on message boards and handsprings site to learn that i needed to download the latest version of the desktop which includes the driver
it also contained the clue i needed in order to remove the partially installed driver so that it would reinstall overall cheap feeling and little silver flecks are already falling off the logo the stylus is uncomfortably scratchy
i usually use a lamy or rotring but sometimes you just want to use the one that is included
the visor stylus is awfulsets my teeth on edge
i swapped points with a palm stylus but this means that you are no longer carrying around a reset pin which is a problem because it locks up regularly requiring resets at least once a week for me
once i have had to do a hard reset and reinstall everything from scratch
the palm needed resets sometimes too but not this often
fortunately my cybertool includes a stainless steel pin as does the swiss card and most victorinox knives with cork screwsget one to go with your retrofitted visor stylus
 sometimes you have to do a reset in order to get usb synch to workeven when the visor appears to be operating normally all my friends with palms are using ir to synch with wk but this is problematic with the visor
i did try irlink but still couldnt get it to work
visor tech report responded very quickly explaining that i should try the new desktop software from palm which does have an ir option although it does not support usb so it would be eitheror
i had actually tried this because it was what the palm owners are using but i couldnt get it to work
i dont want to give up usb also no little ribbon to help pull out the batteries
you have to dig around in there with a screwdriver or somethinghard to get out with your thumb nail the modules are kinda silly
a vibrator
hubba
a set of star trek books
ive never been able to finish an ebook on one of these little screens
the idea of the backup module isnt so bad and maybe ill need another  meg someday
i loved the wireless on my vii but the idea of a modem doesnt appeal to me because i always have my laptop
id buy the gps if it worked in europe
but it doesnt right now
maybe something cool will come out next yearso the thing works ok but if i had to do it again id probably buy a palm
there doesnt seem to be an advantage to the visor if you dont play with the modules
maybe id feel differently if id bought some color other than graphitei got a handspring because it was cool
it has the cardslot springboard which is a little limited in what has actually come out for it but its a good design
the deluxe model has mb and this was a good price for an mb palmpilot with an upgrade slot plus cool colorsthen i realized the problem
the os is in rom not flash
the os on these are palm v which is about a year old
there is no upgrade path to palm os 
to upgrade you have to buy a whole new oneeven if you could youd have to wait for handsprings versioni recommend the palmiiixe its the same thing minus the springboard module only really useful for a few things which are easily worked around
palm xe has mb and flash rom plus it comes with palm os  and is upgradable
if you need the cellphone or wireless option there are sleeves that fit over the pilot that do thisi have to say i come from the world of windows ce so the handspring visor deluxe was my first attempt at a palmos operated pda
my decision to buy it was mainly due to the following reasons   its price
it was the cheapest selling pda where i found enough memory mb for most of my needs

only reco about pocket pcs stay away from casioi will try to drop a word or two about this in a review about their cassiopeia ei use my with my hand spring palm pilot
it works ok but the photo quality is only fair
i only purchased it to expand my handspring visors capabilitiesi received my eyemodule last week and was really impressed with its small size and weight
i took a load of test pictures in seattle over the weekend but was not able to review them because the pc software that came  with the unit would not install on my pc
i kept on getting quotconduit  not foundquot errors part way through the install processi was  finally able to get through to eyemodule technical support this evening and  the support person had me uninstall all the palm desktop software from my  pc and soft reset the visor
after i reinstalled everything the conduit  worked and i was able to view my pictures on my pcmy what a  disappointment
even photos taken a few feet away were dark and indistinct  unless the subject was in bright sun
now i know the cameras limitations i  can use it effectively get as close as you can to subjects in bright light   then youll get photos just about good enough to emailthe eyemodule  is great for candid photogbraphy  no one thinks youre taking a snapshot  just fiddling with a handheld
if only the quality were betterthis was a quirky unit that required more effort to use than one would expect
more of a science project than an appliance
low resolutionfor all you tiny battery fans out there this is the product youve been waiting for
just dont drop it because it will roll off somewhere and youll never find it againbatteries came loose
from amazon i  expect that the picture is a true representation of the product to be delivered
first battery works but i dont know the expiration date of the second
also its not desirable to ship batteries loose without some sort of protection for the terminalsif you look at the picture the batteries are sealed under plastic
when i got these the batteries were scotch taped to the card
i dont have a clue if i got new or used batteries
next time i would order from some other vendorgood batteries and good price i have more tha  week with the batteries and they working good without any problemordered item expecting retail packaging as picturedreceive loose bulk itemsbatteries are new and unusedbatteries work perfectly just disappointed in packagingi purchased this case hoping it would serve double duty for me as a wallet and pda case
while this would be great for anyone who uses a purse or attache case it does not work for someone like me who wants a pocket sized pdathis case is well designed and serves its purpose well
as previously mentioned i no longer use mine simply because it adds too much bulkiness to the visor
i hope this helpsi like the way my visor snaps into and out of the case
the only drawback with this method is that it does not work with my quoteyemodulequot digital camera attached because the camera lens is over the top of the unit  where the leather cases clip fitseven with no papers in the cases  pockets it feels a little tight around my visor
id recommend a few  millimetres more space to be really confortable
the new leather smalls  classy thoughthe product does work as advertised however i had a difficult time installing the drivers during the setup process
im running windows me and noticed that the manufacture placed the drivers in the windows quotinfquot directory not the system directory which is generally the default
so after manually pointing to the proper directory the product installed without faultthe product was recognized as a quotgeneral purpose usb hubquot and created two new drive letters
this allows tremendous versatility
you can open and edit pictures directly on the quotsmart mediaquot memory card or simply copy them to your local hard driveoverall i would recommend this product to friends but gave it a  because the manufacture needs better support ie
faq pages and automated installationmy parents bought this camera and had me install the software and show them how to use it
the box for this camera states that it needs windows  not supported for windows 
the usb drivers that come with the software wont work on windows  tried it with on an hp pavillion computer
ended up buying a smartmedia card adapter that allows the card to be read from the floppy drive which works greatalso the camera is a little akward to hold its not in the shape of a normal camera
and the lens zoom button is not the easiest to use either it is on the back of the camera
the microphone for the avi recording is on the left side of the camera and its pretty easy to accidentally put your hand over it if holding the camera with both handsthe batteries also take a long time to recharge   hours
fortunately it came with two setsthe initial avi clips we made didnt look that good when  viewed in quicktime  but when they played in the windows media player it looked a lot better
i didnt have time to figure out whythis camera was chosen for the better low light sensitivity iso  and the x optical zoom
otherwise i would have told my parents to get the nikon s which i own iso  and only x optical zoom thoughive had the camera for a couple of years now
i sent it back to fuji when it was under warranty because it had a hard time recognizing the smartmedia card
they fixed it promptly
then i sent it to their repair company in california when it decided to turn itself off randomly
they fixed it and it worked for a while
now it is acting up againnow i love the results i get from the camera but i wish it would work when i want it to instead of when it wants toim about to send it in for repair under the warranty from the previous repair
if that doesnt work i think ill give upive been taking mm pictures for  years and this is my favorite camera so far
i shot a couple of hundred rolls of film with this and it really feels like an extension of my vision
the light metering is sophisticated and usually does a great job even in tricky situations the optical quality of the  canon lens is stunning and the frame is sturdy and durable
whats not to likewell theres the manual to begin with
there is no way you can access and understand all of the features that this camera has and there are a lot of features by reading the manual
they just do a poor job of explaining for example the three metering modes and the three autofocus modes
ive had mixed sucess with the eyecontrolled autofocus and find it a distraction now and poor luck with the depth of field mode if i could only get eyecontrolled depth of field to work reliably
depth of field preview
pretty basic my  year old slr had it the iies is not very functional
and for all the ballyhoo about the autofocus modes the predictive focus mode hunts around so much that your subject will be long gone before the camera locks on to it just try taking pictures of a puppycomparing this camera to the rebel i would wish for a combination of the two i would like the light weight and functionality of the rebel with the sturdyness and some of the flexability of the iie
for a beginner stick with the rebel and a good lens not the  youll be much happier
as for me i should be hunting up one of those magiclantern manuals for the iie and practicing with the eyecontrolled autofocusi would rate this camera  stars for what it can do but decided on  stars based on what it should do and doesnt or says it can do but doesnt do very wellthis was the first lens i bought for my first slr camera in  ahh filmi have since graduated to a  fl ii for this focal length range and i photograph professionally now
i couldnt have made it to where i am now without using this little guy but it honestly wasnt very good
it wasnt very sharp it has a variable aperture across the focal length range it produces washed out colors contrast is a little flat and the bokeh doesnt look nice
all that being said for less than one hundred dollars this is a good deal
the autofocus speed is loud and slow but youll find that this lens serves an important purpose it is a first lens
it will teach you how to compose hand hold without is and manual focus
those are all important skillsi know that there are better lenses that exist for a first lens but none of them are as affordable as this little lens
for the price this is a good deal
id also recommend it to someone who has child that wants to try photography and you dont want to be too concerned that the lens will be destroyed by accidentoh i should also mention that i won a competition with a photograph of a baseball with this lens in  it can perform so dont write it off
despite its shortcomings i think this is a lens that warrants consideration as an economy lens or as a backup lensat  ounces this is the lightest compact zoom lens in the ef linean excellent valuethe aspherical element makes it compact and helps obtain high contrast imagesat the mm length is a good first steplead free glass is usedgreat all purpose lens and cheap but if you can go for the mm or the mmthey will give you better performancelens accepts mm filters polorizer and uv highly suggestedspecs taken from canon cataloguethe only thing that i like about this lens is that it has been sealed at the bottom end of the lens
what i mean is that there is a piece of glass that covers the foot of the lens which prevents dirt and moisture from getting inside well dust anyway
the housing is really cheap plastic and the motor is painfully loud oh my this thing is loud
i would not try to use it in a setting where noise is an issue because this thing would wake the dead in a grave yard
it does take okay shots this would make a great lens for a child because they are cheap and if it gets broke your only out like  bucksno its not especially if you take into account its intended users
if you use a canon digital slr and are satisfied with the kit lens  then buying this lens can be the perfect next step for you
practically speaking you will be able to increase your zoom reach to the point where you can a photograph birds in moderately distant trees b be able to zoom in on the other side of a valley and frame something of your interest
those are just two examples
one thing you will not be able to do effectively with this lens however is to take sport shots with it
how so
consider some of the following weaknessat mm zoom range the highest aperture is limited to  you will have to use very slow shutter speed to snap fast action shots remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed
the lens sizeweight combination makes it hard to hold steady when attached to a camera like the rebel xtslow and often inaccurate auto focus i just dont understand why canon makes a usm version of this lens for  more but never includes it in the triple rebate programchromatic aberration is significant in high contrast lighting like in full sun if you do not know what chromatic aberration means search the term online or check out my review of the canon mm  on amazon but to summarize it would be a discoloration at the fringes of objects in your picturethose kinds of weakness will limit your ability to use this lens in all sorts of other situationscircumstances
as a practical rule to follow if the lighting is less than ideal this lens will give you a hard time
meaning it will be possible to use it but you may get too many blurry images because of shake from slow shutter speeds
as for what are ideal lighting conditions
that would be full sun with few or no clouds and with the light bathing your subjectobject from the front or the sideso is this lens that bad
not really as with many other lenses when the lens is coupled with a good camera it still out performs most point and shoot cameras
plus it provides results at par or slightly below the kit lens 
so if you are satisfied with your kit lens which provides you with a zoom range comparable to x zoom   why not add another lens that will expand your zoom range by another x 
nothing wrong with expanding your horizonps
two more points about using this lens first if youre confident you can handhold this lens at slow shutter speeds i know i cant then the low maximum aperture shouldnt be a major problem
second if youre fine shooting at high iso more like  or  then again the low maximum aperture shouldnt be a problem
the nice thing about photography is that you can do one thing in so many ways so dont be afraid to explore with this lensheres the deal i have an  mm efs af is canon lens which provides for a decent zoom
i would say its quality is better than this one from all the reviews ive readi was considering getting the  for the added zoom only but decided to run an experiment
i took a picture with my  lens with the best possible settings at mm
then  i cropped the picture to get the equivalent of what the  would have given me
even zooming in in the picturei got me pretty good results
i havent tried the  as such they have a pretty lousy return policy here but i can bet it will give me no better results
so i saved myself i bought this a few months ago and i already want to upgrade
im using it on a ti and i get decent results but like everyone says is would really help at those longer focal lengths
im going to start looking for the mm which looks great
this lens will get you started in telephoto photography and ive even made some decent photos with it but having to shoot at f all the time sucks
focus speed is decent but it has a very long way to go from infinity to  feet and it will hunt back and forth sometimes which makes me want to throw the lens off of a speeding train
i also think one reason for having a tele is to capture detail of something in a tight frame and at  to around  this lens does an okay job but at mm the detail gets lost even it you get good focus and are stopped down
bottom line get something elsegreat price but the pictures are a little soft
in bright light there is considerable chromatic aberration
this can be corrected in post production but if you take a lot of photos this can be very labor intensive
if money is not a huge issue then spring for a more expensive lens like the sigma mm f dc macro os hsm or the tamron sp af mm f di vc usd
the cost benefit of the time saved in post production is well worth iti bought this lens so i coulld take picture of performers up on stage or of people playing sports my problem with it was that unless you are using a tripod and a remote there was no way to operate this lens at its maximum focal poitn without blurryness on the picture caused by even slight movement of the camera such as pressing the shutter button i  would recommend people pay a little extra for the canon mm with is which prevents camera shake and makes shots that much easierfor the price who can resist
it offers the zoom you need at an affordable price
yes at mm the optics are a little iffy and image stabilization would be a plus but you get what you pay for
i got this lens new for  so im not one to complain about its optical performance
i get the zoom i need and im content
ill find ways to work out the handheld shakiness at mm by making sure i can have a fast shutter speed
obviously you cant correct its optical quality so what i recommend get the lens now if you need the zoom and sell it when youre ready to buy a better telephoto zoom
if you dont need the zoom now keep saving for a higher quality lensnot as sharp and definitely not fast for action autofocus shotsfor hobby only use on weekend this would be okay ive shot a lot of birds on this lens and they come out just okay just okay
the construction is just average barrel play on manual focus might be an issue for someif youll try to shot stunning vivid and fast shots you might be better off spending a little more and pick the more pro lensesthis lens is good for sunny days and for the newbie who just want to have a decent focal lenght lens
mm is really not badive bought a canon mm l is usm f lens big difference both in sharpness color and speed and also really big difference in price toobut eventually thats what hobbies are all about start small and grow if you have the money just skip this one and buy the real deal memories are priceless capture it the best way you canof course that are better lens than this onebut for the price its quite a nice lenswhoever is looking at this one is because wants a tele to take some snaps with your dsrlextreme photographers may not like these ones many adjectives might be said slow focus and f bulky etcbut i am pleased with when using it on outdoor pics if you are thinking about using it on indoor pictures better have a tripod and also use a high iso specially at mmthe usm on it play its role and i dont think it is slow as i have seen in some other reviews around herebut for the price i paid and with my rebel xt and again if you are looking for a good tele lens i would recomend it but be aware that is has its limitationses un lente complejo es econoacutemico la construccioacuten es solida los resultados son descentes con buena luz pero con poca luz es muy deficiente pues no es muy luminoso se debe tener muy buen pulso o utilizar un tripode
ultimamene lo estoy combinando con unos lentes macro que se colocan frente al lente son como lupas y he tenido resultados interesanteslo he usado en el rango de los mm a los  mm para retrato y da buenos resultados maacutes de mm ya no es bueno el resultadoolviden usarlo en esposiciones de  o  la falta de estabilizador se siente mucho y las fotos salen subesxpuestas ademaacutes no enfoca muy raacutepido
si esta pensando en un lente de este ranfgo creo que le vendriacutea mejor un  que viene con estabilizador de imaacutegen y esta por el mismo rango de precio y si tiene buen presupuesto les recomiendo el fijo  de la serie l de lo mejor de canonits light weight and easy to use
i wish the manual focus ring had marks especially for infinity
its pictur quality is nicefor the price this is an ok zoom lens
im left wanting an imagestabilized lens though because i have found it difficult to get consistently good results with this lens without the constant use of a tripod
i have years of slr photography experience and a very steady hand i can get clear shots at th of a second with a mm focal length
with this lens its difficult even at th of a second which is about an average exposure time for this lens in daylight at  iso
the lens is also slow to autofocus and somewhat inaccurate causing some photos to come out slightly blurry
if you really have to have a zoom lens now and cant afford an is lens this ones not a bad choice
but if you can wait save your money and get an is lens with faster focusing and better optics
youll be glad you didthis lens seems to not work well with my camera and i really dont know what the problem is as it does not take good pictures when i attach it to my camerathis was my first ef telephoto lens when i transitioned to dslr over five years ago
the first copy i got was part of my eos d kit and it was a dud
its af was broken
i exchanged it afterwards
i didnt use it a lot
the only time i used this lens extensively was in santa cruz shooting the monarch butterflies hanging off the trees
overall the picture quality coming out of this lens was not that bad
it s just soft and you do need a tripod as this lens is quite slow
it would definitely help with is
there are certainly more room for improvement
when canon introduced the efs mm i quickly replaced the efmm with that and it was a day and night difference
i dont know why canon still continues to produce it
although it is full frame compatible i dont think anyone wants to use it on a d or d
it just doesnt make sense
get the efs mm instead
its not that more expensive
you gain a ud glass element and is
picture quality is a lot better and you ll be a lot more happierthis lens is a popular entry level zoom
for the money you get a pretty big zoom range and ok quality in good light
for a little more you can get the ef  f
the  features ringtype usm which allows fulltime manual focusthat means you can adjust the focus manually without switching to manual mode
also the focus is quicker and quieter without rotating or extending the front element so the use of circular polarizers is easierif you can afford the extra money i would recommend the  as a budget telephoto zoom
if not this one is ok but not goodit is a good product but i should have kept saving money and buy the  mm telephoto for photographing college baseballpictures in low light conditions were not that good pictures at midrange were ok i could take better portraits with it than zoom shotsmy cousin dropped it oncerolled off the car seat the drop broke off the afmf button
i have still been able to use it though it has trouble auto focussingit was a good purchased for the price but the quality of the pictures are not that good
i took a few pictures at a baseball stadium and did not  came out with the quality i expectedthis is a good standard telephoto zoom with solid but average performance
this particular lens features canons micro ultra sonic motor therefore it does not have the same focusing performance of the standard usm designs
optically it is the same lens as the ef  iii and performs roughly the same
usually this lens retails for more than the nonusm design but id pay little more
an oddity on amazon has often had the price of this lens lower and thats a good dealas previously stated the lens is a solid performer
good lens speed but not as fast of focusing as the ef   additionally the front of the lens rotates which is not as nice when using filters such as polarizers
the plastic barrels are ok but zooming is a bit less smooth than desiredcanon also doesnt include much with the lens
a lens shade is very useful for outdoors photography and canon is very pricey on an accessory that most include
canons oneyear warranty is also poor compared to most othersfor a good alternative look at the tamron  promaster  ld lens which has closer focusing includes the shade and both offer longer warranties
however neither are as quiet as the canon lensesfor an upgrade look at the canon ef  usm which offers a smoother faster usm and no filter rotationthis lens has been around for a while
its good value for the money but theres better lens in the canon line that wont break your bank eitheryou want to move up to the lens with the same description except for one thing it will say usm
those are the motors that autofocus uses
theyre quieter and they work better
there are people that cite problems with autofocus
if youre buying this lens you are probably using it on a body that is more limited in controlling the afbut buy the other lens for about  morei was glad to get the replacement lense since my original one was stolen from my house
when i installed it onto the camera and placed it on auto focus option  the lense kept trying to focus going back and forth but never stops attempting to focus on anythingas far as lenses go im not an expert by any means
but i would say if you can afford  for a lens then these are pretty good
but i would recommend saving up or footing the bill for a more expensive one as you get good shots with this but i think they could be better
i have a ti and the shots i get from this are decent but i have a feeling could be a lot better with a higher quality lens
its good for the pricei tried it inside the building without a tripod and most pictures were useless because it doesnt have image stabilization
im planning to sell it on ebaythis is not the greatest lens in the world
i find its very soft at the mm lens length
it is slow f is the fastest at mm and f at the full telephotoi tried it in various situations for nature photography i was grabbing a shot of a rare bird while hiking
it was not a great photo
the softness was annoying though i got an acceptable enough shot for identification
is image stabilization would have helped in this application but this lens doesnt have that added feature
i put it on a very stableamazonbasics inch adjustable pistol grip head tripodwhich is not a hikers tripod but a very heavy lb beast of a tripod that is going nowhere when you set it up
i photographed the moon at mm using a remote shutter release
i didnt stop down the lens perhaps that would have been better but i was using a  second exposure and shakes happen even on tripods
the photo was sharp enough to see craters at the edge of sunlight on the surface but they werent razor sharp
the entire effect was soft admittedly we have pollution and it was a cloudy morning
you pretty much have to use a tripod with this lens unless its brilliant sun outside and even thenif you must have this length and it is a handy one for sports and even candid portraits then its a budget choice
but compared to my mm its a lot softer and just not quite the thingi tried this lens out when looking for a lowcost telephoto lens for my digital rebel xt sidebyside with the usm version the is version and several lseries lenses in similar focal lengths the latter being but a pipe dream and way out of my budget at the timein short if you want a lens with a long reach and have next to nothing to spend this might be the lens for you
id suggest spending the extra money on the usm version for the slightlyfaster focusingits really just a pittance more unlike the is lens although not appreciably sharper than this lensphotos are remarkably soft particularly toward the mm end
if you want this lens for nature and sports photography be prepared for a lot of work in photoshop to get something sharp enough to use and forget about professionalquality printsthe focus is very slow and the lens itself rather slow throughout its rangeand particularly at mm where youre going to be locked into f
this means longer exposure times andor requires better lighting which limits its usefulness for capturing action at any distancepersonally id save up a bit more or else rent a better lens if you immediately need something in this focal range
however if youre okay with the softnessperhaps youre only doing portraiture and want to put your camera halfway across the roomand can deal with the other limitations the lens is very affordableits a good zoom lens
yes it is slow and that is a problem when blowing up handheld shots
a tripod is a necessity if youre concerned with shake
on bright days though i havent had a problem with it
the usm is good for quieter operation though the focus can be slow in low contrast situationsmetal lens mount and a sturdy feel are also nice features on this lens
its a great choice compared to the cheaper version and for those of us who cant afford the more expensive faster or is modelsbought this lens with a digital rebel xt as part of a package
this lens looks formidable compared to the stock lens
if youre shooting in daylight you should be able to get some pretty good shots
the  crop factor on the digital rebel xt effectively turns this into a  mm equivalent
cant beat that for the priceunfortunately the rather small aperture of f at mm means this lens cant be used in low or maybe even lowmedium light
several pictures shot at mm in the evening came out very blurry  f just didnt let enough light in
earlier today in a dimly lit auditorium  w blub every ft or so i could not get a sharp properly exposed picture  it was either very sharp very dark or just enough light but too blurryim losing too many shots to low light
i suggest you look for a lens with a larger aperture  the ef m seems to fit this bill but costs  as well
but i mean 
what can i expect
the lens is a great value just remember that its a poor performer in low lightwell everyone needs one  and for many including myself this is the first step in the telephoto road
yes the value is there and for the casual photographer that just needs a telephoto this will work outwhat you will soon discover is that with a aperture of  you will get some blurred shots as the sun goes down or indoors
you will also find that the clarity and resolution at full zoom just isnt there upon close inspection
my brother and myself took the same photo several times
i was using a mm prime and he was using this lens  the difference was amazing
even i didnt think it could make that big of a difference going into a prime lens
the image was easily  times the clarity and resolution on cropped imagesnow dont fret for the average point and shoot crowd this will be a very nice step into the telephoto world but if you are like many you will be saving your change for the next lens after about  monthsmost experienced photogs wouldnt waste their time with this lens but for a newbie or someone on a limited budget it is fine
it is best in good lighting conditions but you may have to fiddle with the aperture and iso in low light
then it will be grainy anyway
and it wont really bring in the subject from very far away but no mm will
so dont expect stunning nature photos or nascar photos from the cheap seats
the images i posted are from  away from the subject at most cedar waxwings and they have some grain even at iso  but most people think they are decent enough
anyway it is a good way to get into a longer telephoto on the cheap
enjoy but understand its limitationson a tight budget when i purchased my drebel almost two years ago  this lens looked very attractive
since owning it for two years  it seems to go further and further to the back of my equipment bag  and not taken in my backpack at all unless the climate is too harsh for my more expensive lensesin fairness to the product  it is very good for what it cost and how it is designed
it makes no pretension to be anything other than an af f mmlt telephoto
the construction has remained solid  the zoom fairly stiff or tight when newsometimes makes funny noises from grit lodged in the nether regions of the lens barrel i am a defense contractor who travels to some pretty rotten climates
dust and dirt do not seem to be a serious problem with regular maintenance of brush and blower around the rotating parts of the lens barrelthings i enjoyed with this purchase light weight solid construction
acceptable optical quality in sunny outdoor use
accepts the same filters mm as my drebel kit lens
affordable for those on a tight budget
compatible with the drebel autofocus and auto exposure system
expendable if something bad happens in harsh climates

clears airport security without manual inspectionunsatisfactoryannoying qualities that quickly became evident f limited my use indoors or low light
plan to spend much time in photoshop to save your pictures
length of lens made it unusable with the drebel popup flash lens shadow
immediate purchase of a ex speedlight  see my review cured this problem
front focus rotating lens element limited my filter choices to uv haze filter only
annoyingly slow auto focus
tripod is almost manditory with lower shutter speeds see f  limits
the x magnification factor when seated to the drebel brings the focal length out to over mm making off tripod use risky use of a bge battery grip  see my review with this lens  lowers camera center of gravityextra counterweight makes lens use less stressfulgood price  fair optics  limited overall performance
limits for the serious photographer make one want to look elsewhere
sigma has superior product in this price category as well as the house brand at ritzwolf camera chainswhile the discriminating photographer who has the resources should look seriously at canons l series as ive done or is series as suggested by other experienced reviewersi am a dad that likes to take pictures of my kids
i feel that this could be a little better forgive me that i cannot put to technical terms what i find wrong with this
just does not work that great for me
good quality well made but seems lacking in the focus
i hope this makes some sense
happy that i bought here for  less than canon sells fori am satisfied because of the price
i was expecting a far greater zoom capability but its better than the lens that came with my t
i find no reason to get the more expensive versions with the is because i have steady hands
i would recommend iti really enjoy this lens
prop up a tripod and a remote shutter and i can get some amazing shots of the moon
i just wish i spent a little more to get the image stabilized one but alas i had no money at the time but really wanted to get some photosif you dont have surgeon steadyhands this lens will only work sometimes and a tripod or monopod are going to be needed
because it is not is image stabilizer it  becomes hard to take a still specially in low lightgo this along with my rebel xti  kit
not bad
great lens for action sports or wildlife
you can also create great depth with this one
wish the aperture would open up to  at least
i shot hockey for an assignment and really had a tough time i got my shots but i couldve gotten more with a larger ap
will upgrade on this in the next couple years
they make a  usm with is that i will replace this with eventually but for right now this is nice to have in my case just in
casei own several top quality canon l lenses so i am used to using the very best lensesthe instructions for this lens state do not focus in mf manual focusing when the focus mode is set to af auto focus
the top of the line canon lenses allow you to tweak the focus manually after the auto focus has done the best it canthe auto focus is slower than that of l lensesi captured a shot of the moon and the color aberrations on the on the edges of the moon were quite visible when the images where viewed at this is not a professional quality lens which costs  more than this lensthe lens at  mm f is  stops slower than the f lens meaning the exposure time must be  times longer than the f l lensthis is not a lens to shoot weddings in a dark church where flash is not permitted
this is not a lens to capture car racesused outdoors in sunlight this lens is quite acceptable
do you want to take a photo of your child at bat in a day baseball gamethis lens will meet your needs at  less than an l quality lensif you didnt understand what i mentioned about color aberration and you dont use manual focus tweaking and you dont want to freeze frame fast motion and you dont have a creative effect in mind that requires the lens open more than f this lens is a very cost effective lensas a final note while i own other canon lenses that cost about  times as much as this lens i am keeping this lens with a complete understanding of the limits of when i may use the lens effectivelyit is a great value for the moneyi should start off stating that i am a newbie at slr photography but with the basic rules underneath my belt of focal length and shutter speeds figured out i decided i could graduate to this lens
this is my first external lens purchase for my rebel ti slr outside of the mm stock usm is lens
i had read all the reviews for this lens on here first and decided to take a chance with this lens
i did not see anyone mentioning using this for aircraft or aviation photography but since this was the least expensive lens i took the gamblethe lens fit my slr fine and was simple to figure out
my first test subjects proved to be impressive and i think make a good case for this lenses strong point
the pictures were of common household goods such as ceiling fans my dog etc
it is good to know that this lens will function well enough for those purposes but i noticed that it would hesitate and not accurately focus
it would hunt for the focus for a few moments and only rectified by changing the zoom on the lens
i wasnt too concerned here as i specifically bought this lens for aviation photography
i was not concerned with the lack of is as i keep the shutter speed fast for the majority of the shots
after shooting a few hundred pictures today at the local regional airport i came home to discover only  somewhat usable photos
almost all photos were either too soft too blurry or too out of focus
granted i did use the auto focus feature on the lens exclusively but the lens was taking soft photos throughout the various shutter speeds focal lengths etc
i did intentionally vary shutter speeds and fstops but all action shots were blurry including ones in the action shot setting on my rebel
again even with the college class i took on photography im not a pro and i very well may have changed a setting however with so few usable shots from today im certain i did everything textbook
i dont know if stopping it down would have yield any better results but after doing all the tricks i could think of in the field i was confident that i would have had at least a set of good picturesi must state this i was aware that the quality might not have been all there due to previous reviews but as with im sure most of us i cannot justify to my wife buying an l series mm lens or better now and unfortunately after todays follies i do not think she will let me ever take that stepbottom line this lens would be great for closeup still life flowers portraits macroattachments etc but not good with anything of movement or at distances regardless of settings
also af is garbagethis is arguably canons weakest telephoto lens that they produce
you are better off spending a little more money and getting the canon efs   they are both entry level zoom lenses but the  gives you much better image quality plus image stabilizationhowever i have some complaints about the flash output
the build quality isnt the issue
if you test the flash out you will almost be blinded by the bright light
but for some reason the flash doesnt seem to ever die
this means after  rolls of film the flash dims to the point where it starts to make the pix under exposed to the point of being not fixable
so every  exposures replace all  aa batteries
the old batteries will still be usable in lower power electronics so dont toss them outjust brought a ex nd hand
had some test shots with my canon digital rebel xti
after you turn on the camera and the ex mounted on it it does show the ettl indicator
as per my camera documentation mine is a typea camera
i followed all the steps in the ex manual as well as my xti manual
looks like the best results are with either av aperture priority or tv shutter priority
i think setting the aperture as wide as you can in av mode and letting the camera choose the best shutter speed works best for me
i have tested with iso  may be i am missing something but the performance of the speedlite does not seem to be any better than the inbuilt flash
i struggled a lot trying to make the speedlite work in auto mode no luck it just wont sync with the shutter
may be i need to test more settings and see what i am missingupdate found it best fit if used as fill flashthese are nice optics
so canon why not include dust lens covers
come onbuyers plan on purchasing pairs of screw on uv filters to protect the coated optices and lens capsrecent purchase of these
either the eyecups will hopefully soften up or i will get callouses on the bridge of my nose
super stiff and too large a diameter eyecups
come on canon dont you listen to the feedback of all the people complaining about the eyecups on thesethe image stabilization is nice makes a big difference too bad i am also focusing on the pain from the eyecupsi went into this purchase knowing the eyecups and eyerelief issues were there so i am hoping to figure someway to improve on this
i did find some websites that show different ways to improvereplace these eyecups nothing too easy though since it appears that the eyecups are mounted quasipermanently to the binocularsthis lens is cheap and very light
admittedly i wasnt very impressed at first but with addition of a sigma uv filter my pictures at mm are now clearer and a truer reflection of the subject
at  the pictures tend to be a bit soft but its noticeable unless you do some serious cropping
with this lens i also prefer to shoot with auto zoom instead of manual zoomi should have taken measurements of my camera before bying this item
i havea small sony cybershot
i was able to clean the lens with this but only withthe tip at an extreme angle wiping with the edge of the little round disk
itdid the trick but this device is not for pocket size cameras
its for largerlenses only
the brush however is very handy
i keep it in the pouch withmy camera when travelingi admit i havent played around with this too much so far but from what ive seen its a little weak
the idea was to put this in my car because i drive around a lot on the interstate and sometimes music just gets boring when you drive as much as i do
i realize the antenna that comes with these is nothing to brag about but ive picked up basically nothing but static from nearby transmissions by the time i squelch out the alternator whine in my car
maybe the truckers around here are just shy the weather stations work fine however
im not going to give it an absolutely horrible rating because hey its a handheld cb
they arent exactly known for being awesome
but for this price and brand name i guess i expected a little better
maybe i just have bad luck with cbs because i used to have an ancient handmedown midland mounted in my truck with an  foot antenna and it didnt quite live up to my expectations eitherthis thing probably works much better if youre not in a car im considering buying a small magnetmounted external antenna and seeing if that helpsworks fine but range is very limited
during an emergency i am not sure how good this will work in the woodsit is a ok unit
i do not know about putting another outside ant on it as it is only going too be used to go  wheeling with the rules say one must have a radio range is short about a mile which works for the need
i have a  in my jeep this one was a gift to my wheeling partner so not to have to mount anything
so it works i can say thatif you dont have an external antenna you will only hear others that are close by
i use this for  wheeling my jeep  there is usually about  of us in a group back to back and i can only converse with those closest to me
i leave it on channel  on the hwy again can only hear those close by usually right behind me or right in frontwhat is nice about this unit is that it can use batteries or you can plug it into your cigarette lighter cord does come with it but is hidden in the package so be sure to find it before discarding the packaging
ive had mine since  and use it yralso be careful of it falling over on the talk button
thankfully we werent talking about anyone when it happened to usmy targus stowaway keyboard for visor deluxe seemed to have died over the weekend after eighteen months
actually it was an internal conflict within the visor
i had added a jumper wire inside the visor so i could charge from my hot synch
cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle  my stowaway keyboard worked just like before after making this modification
then i downloaded targus lastest version of the driver for the keyboard
a couple of days later the keyboard was completely nonresponsive
i have removed the jumper now
i later found the real problem was that my visor was in its final stages of life
the keyboard does have a nasty habit of ceasing to communicate with my pda
by experimentation i learned that a soft reset followed by a warm reset got it going again
the keyboard works well when it works but too often it does not
again this is probably more of a problem with the visor than the keyboardi think i ended up selling this camera on ebay for parts
the button on top broke and i think it had some type of error
overall it was a great little camera that fit right into your pocketi purchased this brother ptouch tape for an older ptouch labeler and the tape jammed
for some reason the older printer works better with  tape though it is rated for the  width tooi used another new tape in this same label printer and it broke
i contacted brother to ask about a replacement and never heard from themi was expecting this tape to be as sharp and precise as the black on white tape
that is not the case
although it is ok it is not wonderful the edges look a bit fuzzy not nearly as sharp as the other tapes i used
the black on clear is wonderful but not the white on clear
somewhat disappointingi had previous given this product one star because of a completely worthless warranty service
eventually after much hounding the warranty department finally came through and replaced the broken pc cord that came with the flash
so ive moved it up to three starswith that in mind the flash itself is a four or five star item
it does just what i want a not too expensive dumb flash i can use for off camera flash work
a few adjustable manual power settings manual zoom and tilt provide about all the variables really needed for off camera flash work
sure itd be great if it would tilt more than  degrees or swivel as well but these things are more important for on camera work
there could be more manual power settings too but three is good enough for most workso if you want to get a cheap apparently reliable so far flash for off camera strobe work it is hard to go wrong with this flash
be warned though you may need to be very persistent with the warranty department if you have a problemi used these film to test my newly acquired vintage camera and i was satisfied for the result
the color is okay as the fuji films are noted for superb colorit was a  pack with a rollnot as it was featured on the pici just hope that rolls of film are in good conditionvery grainy on outdoor shotsgood quality indoors
good colors on indoor
colors ran outdoorsi would recommend for indoori used this product before and it was ok but on the last purchase i had a bad experience with the film it came out in weird colors
i like fuji i think that was a rare case of failed quality controlused this camera in a snorkeling escapade where the sun was really really bright
the photos were taken approximately from depths ranging from above water feet deep
all of the photos lack really good sharpness clarity and are somewhat fuzzy
if you can remember the mm camera taking days you will understand exactly what to expectthese photos represent that cheaper rolls of  speed film that one could buy for their mm cameras back then
if you recall the absence of crispness detail and suchthen you know exactly what i am talking about
for that is how all of my photos turned outslightly below average photos
if you were going to take a bunch of photos i would suggest buying a cheaper compact digital camera and one of the waterproof pouches that allow for taking of pictures underwater
a digital camera that does not have the telescopic lens would be ideal in these type bagsby the time you purchase  of these cameras and have the pictures developed at  per you have already spent enough money to purchase a small compact digital camerachriseastern nci believe the camera takes  shots
we got money shots of the boys feeding nurse sharks
follow the directions and you can have good quality photos
no pictures below  feet of water
no full sun pictures
there is no stress in giving a  yearold a  camera
it is a little hard to wind the film knobi used this at the beach with one of my friends during the summer
taking photos were easy and with the camera in the case we were able to take pictures without worrying about the film not to mention toss the camera around or chase after it after getting buffeted by the waves the camera floatswhen developing the photos they came out slightly blurry even the ones on the ground and the colors seemed pale and washed out
while i havent used film cameras in a while im still positive that the color quality is much higher than what we achievedthen again you get what you pay for and its not many digital cameras that you can take into an ocean and walk back out of it with your photos
for the price we paid were just glad we still have the memoriescamera is a bit bigger than most disposables because of the plastic outercase
avoid any lotion getting on the lens area because it will become foggy instantly
pictures are grainy for sure but ok if there is enough light on the underwater reef and fish
colors are more bright than kodak camerai used it snorkeling in hawaii
even on sunny days in crystal clear water they came out mostly graygreen and crude rather than sharpdetailed so i stopped using it for fish turtles coral etc
there were usually two or three photos in each batch of  that didnt turn out at all
i had three different developers so that wasnt the problemlongs and walmart definitely did the best job of developing from these cameras
longs sells the cameras for about  each tooit did a fine job on easy pictures of people and many landscape shots that werent taken when the light was too bright or too dim like twilight sunset or indoor pictures
under less than ideal lighting they often came out very crude and grainy with no contrastits fine as a temporary cheap camera or for the kids but youll probably want a digital camera above water so you can verify and redo your valuable vacation pictures under all lighting conditionsbought these for our hawaii trip they worked fine but after buying these developing the film etc it probably wouldve been cheaper and more convenient to spend an extra  for a cheap waterproof digital camera
at least that way we couldve taken more shots and figured out if some shots didnt come out
now im out all that money and if we go on vacation again ill plan to spend money on a waterproof digital camera but i could have bought that last time and still had itive always been happy with kodaks underwater disposable cameras
now that theyre winding down ive heard their quality has suffered and decided to give fuji a shotthis took pictures quickly was easy to operate and came with a little rubber wrist band
very convenientits also very affordable eliminating some of the anxiety of using a digital cameraminus  stars for picture quality
everything came out grainy w a blueish tint
just not a nice way to preserve memoriesi have a kodak digital underwater camcorder which also takes pictures albeit slowly
it has its own issues but the picture quality is outrageously better and ill stick with it on future tripsoverall this is quick and convenient
picture quality is below average and developing photos is twice the cost of the camera
look at waterproof digital cameras if theyre in your budgeti bought this for my husband to use while snorkeling on our honeymoon cruise
he enjoyed having it to play with and i dont regret the purchasejust keep in mind that you get what you pay for
this isnt a professional wellcrafted waterproof machine its a disposable camera in a protective shell
it works just fine but the picture quality is just average
we were on st john and the water was crystal clear but it looks murkier in these photos
again thats perfectly acceptable for the price but have realistic expectations or youll be disappointedif you only need to carry around your digital slr camera with one lens and no accessories this bag will do but you still have to be careful cause it doesnt provide any protection against fallingafter reading the reviews i thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is
it really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards
i would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens but the conical shape prevents thatyou can certainly fit a d d d plus the mm vr lens into this  it has about the right length a little to spare for filters
however its quite a bit wider and taller than is necessary
its really quite a big bag for an slr holster
i cant see what the extra space is for unless you have an older generation dslr with a bigger body
the camera is reasonably located inside so it shouldnt flop around too much but if youre looking for something snug and neat this isnt itif you have a shorter lens like the kit lenses then go for the lowepro topload zoom mini but with the  lens the mini is about half an inch too shallow  otherwise it would be ideal and much much smaller than the zoom tripod worked well and seemed sturdy
however after six months about  uses an internal plastic part broke on a leg clamp
now it is nonfunctionaloff to the company website after two layers of companys deep velbon and hakubausa i find a service page
email using the provided link
bounces mailbox full
try to call were sorry we are unable to take your call
hmmmm
this one may be heading to the dumpster after just five usesi found this case somewhat diasappointing
its a useful size and organizes cds well but its not very substanital has no padding and only a thin fabric shell
it is essentially a bag with  plastic cd organizers in itwhat id hoped for was something similar with some padding or the nice heavy material case logic uses in its envelopes books and other cd cases
this is not up to par with other products from this companythat said it was surprisingly difficult to find a portable cd organizer which stores cds in their cases
that it does
so if thats what you need and you cant find a suitable substitue this will work  just dont expect it to be the same quality as their other products or you will be disappointed as i wasthese hold the cables but they are a pain to roll and unrollonce rolled up the want to keep that formso you have to keep trying to stretch them out from the rolled up form when you try to use them againthey work but the strip only has the second side of velcro on the end so you have to wrap the entire thing around the cords before it secures
when the cords arent all that thick then the tie is loose and doesnt really hold the wires all that well
i should have just spent the money on a roll of tapeunlike other velcro sleeves these do not have the option of attaching to the cable which makes it inconvenient if you want to use it in a situation where you want to take it off and on frequentlythe picture and description of the product come up short
there is a use for theses just not for me
regular velcro ties are more functional than these
colors fancy smancy and no big deal for my needsthese color coded tags help identify the connection to and from a device if you use many pieces of equipment
a bag of six is just enough for the basic home user
it uses velcro fasteners
length can be cut it fit
no place to write any names or purpose
color identification onlyit doesnt fit my existing cases but i will find a way to use it either a binder or a hole puncher may be the solutionthe noise reduction in these headphones is good and they dont drain the battery fast
as long as the phones are fitted tight to your ear the noise reduction works pretty well
if you travel a lot like i do youd want a stronger headband than these have
the folding function is good and theyre compact when folded up and put in the included carrying bag
but when you travel a lot like i do the folding parts of the phones wear out pretty quick
the function still works well but im trying to figure out a way to reinforce the headband so it clamps better to my ear
its a bummer theres not a better midlevel more durable folding noise reduction headphones that are at a midlevel pricepointi recently purchased this model after comparing to the koss unit
what clinched the purchase for me was actually going to panasonics site and checking out the specifications
this is the headphone they sell with their portable dvd units
i bought this set of headphones to go with my new laptop which also has a dvd player and i thought they would be useful for that taskthe effect of the noise cancellation is very nice and something that isnt very easy to describe
the best term i can come up for it is quotactive silencequot you can quothearquot something in that the quotsomethingquot you hear is different than the ambient noise but its just dead quiet
very useful when youre working around computersthe sound quality and the construction of the unit are my two beefsfirst the headphones do hiss a bit
there is an audible background hiss just having them plugged in
this does go away pretty well when the noise cancelling is turned on howeveri have had to create an equalizer setting for them because their range seems a little odd
the low range on them is about right but the mids are weak and the highs are too strong
so its necessary to turn the highs down turn the mids up and the mediumlow range down
this is easy enough if youre using a computer with an equalizer that supports presets
it might not be so easy with say a discman or something similarsecond somebody reviewed this unit and said that they quotpinchquot a little and that the ear muffle is shaped incorrectly for human ears
this is mostly correct
because the unit folds in half there is a constant tension against your ears which the pads on the phones do not really protect you from
i noticed that taking my glasses off eased this pain in my ear
however not having my glasses on makes using the computer futile
they get real uncomfortable after about two hours of usewould i buy them again
well maybe if the price was dropped  and i had a chance to try out the koss unit
otherwise i think the only real reason to purchase them is so you can wow your friends and tell them they have noise cancelling
hardly worth  for thati picked these up as possible replacements for the panasonic rphts which apparently have been dropped from the line
like the s theyre true foldaway headphoneslight compact comfortable convenient to carry and wear
unlike the s they use a twosided rather than a singlesided cord connection and they require insertion of a battery which makes them marginally heavier
the sound is efficient or responsive and bright if not brilliant
but in sidebyside comparisons with my other headphones including panasonic rphts and sennheiser pxs the panasonic s are definitely wanting in terms of balance spaciousness and fullness
if you dont mind the cumbersome size and foot cord the panasonic rpht s are hard to beat for the price
otherwise the sennheiser pxs are the inescapable choicelittle overachievers that not only make the ride but hold their own against the more costly and conspicuous competitionthe camcorder box and spec says it is good for  megapixel photos
it is a lie
the image quality is like magnifying a  x  to  megapixel
the result is coarse pixelation of the photo i called the sony customer support and they told me if it looks good on the view finder then sonys job is done
what a lie
sony wake up and dont tell liesi have bought sony radios in the past and they were great on sound
this unit big as it is is not that good sounding
it sounds tinny because of the thin plastic speaker enclosers
i should have bought the xplod
i am happy with everything but the soundit is everything more than this camera at a lower price if you have a canon s
the caselogic bag is leatherette  has detachable straps and you can secure it to your belt
the only exception is that you can fit a compact flash case in it and nothing more
the caselogic because it is leather has a better feel and a more professional look to it for less
ive seen this samsonite and didnt pick it up becase i found something else that better fit my canon scompared to the overpriced lowepro brand this is a good camera bag
i would have given it  stars but i took away one star because the zipper sucks
one of the  zipper handles came off the track and is useless
real pain sometimes but at least the other works
i took away another star because its not that efficient with space
one or two more small dividers would be nice as well as larger side mesh pouches or straps to hold extra lenses waterbottle etc
the mesh pouches on it are useless
maybe put a lens cap in there
max height of bag can hold a nikon dslr wmm lens
when i have my mm on the body its a smidge too long but still fits
a padded neckshoulder part on the strap would be nice but then again this thing is only yes these are cheaply made as evidenced by the price
they are basically a toy but the people who complain that they dont work on cb radios and the like simply didnt read the description which states with boom microphone will make conversing on your midland family radio easier and more convenient
these are only for frs radios from midland but may work on other frs radios as long as they have the same plug arrangement
btw frs stands for family radio service as in motorola talkabouts and the like not cbs
remember if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
good headsets like this cost anywhere from about  upthese work great but the boom mic isnt well thought out
its just some wire in a plastic mold and feels like to much tension would snap it
if you can get past the issues of the boom mic it works great
clear sound coming through and broadcastingplease note the vox function of the headset is ment to work in tandem with the vox function of your cb if your cb doesnt have a vox function do not use it
keep the device set on push to talk and youll have no problems
the product warns you of this with a flyer but you dont see that until youve purshaced it already
my cb doesnt have a vox function and the push to talk mode is quite functionalif the boom of this device was better designed id likely give this a  but its a huge annoyancethis is a solid well built unit that i have no problems using or hearing
the only problem i have is that there is no volume control for the microphone which seems to be an exception for most plantronics headsets ive seen
i have to really speak up to get callers to hear me even after adjusting the microphone boom to the position that gives the highest volumei started out with this camera but quickly switched to the dscp when that model arrivedthe dscp has nearly identical performance but improves very nicely on the dscs
first the p is a lot smaller
the compact size really helps to make it easier to use
second the p has a built in lens cover that opens or closes as you turn the camera on or off
and the p is the same price as the si would recommend that anyone looking at the s consider the p insteadi buy this mp player in december last year but  months later i discover some bugs i primaly use it in the car stereo it takes too much time to start playing mps the resume feature dont works all the time it skips some files in playing from time to time an error ocurs and it reset the play to the first song of the first album in the car is kind of dificult to operate it if you want a mp for the car i recomend you one with remote control besides the esp works fine even in rocky roadsthe exp  is cool because it can play mp files
its not so cool because it is expensive  has very poor earphones that are too large to fit in my ears does not take slight shakes very well takes an awefully long time to recover from shakes and has a very hard to read lcd screen
i think it should be fairly priced at just bought it a month ago
my original intention was to to carry along while im doing my walking exercise in the morning
 listen to my collection while commuting to my office it comes with a car kit  use it while im workingpros would read doublebyte character filenames and folders now this is big plus for me or for anyone that use it to listen to japaness chinese or korean music read mb cdr ive bought a lot of them sound quality is greatcons the resume function doesnt live up to what it means
in shuffer mode when you pause the player for longer enough that it automatically turns off it cannot resume to the last song that you listen to when you turn it back on
now you have to press quotplayquot gt quotmodequot to go back to shuffle mode and if a repeated song is played and you dont want to listen to again youll have to press quotgtgtquot to skip
since it is very rare that you would finish from song  to song  in any particular situation this is quite annoying
ive to reset the playlist several times a day no cache for the file list
everytime it stops long enough and you hit quotplayquot youll have to wait for  seconds for it to quotredirquot the whole cd it sometimes skips while im carrying it during my morning walking session
maybe its only a problem of my unit im not quite sure
im not jogging or running it can read cdrw media but sometimes it fails as for the majority of cddvd readers out therei guess well have to wait for the nd generation mpcd player for enhancement like support for id tag and more sophociated playlisti bought mine as a cheap alternative to a cd changer for my car
on the whole its a nice toy
i have several qualms with it howeverdriving on long trips it will randomly just shut off for no reason whatsoever
power isnt interrupted and there are no disc errors
it just turns offrandom play probably skips over a good  of the songs on a cd
that becomes very irritatingthe car power adapter doesnt fit in my cig lighter well its as if its too longthe skip protection is great however
once you get past the long load time the poor random and the unnecessary skips its a decent player  and a good deal for the priceas always i will concentrate on the cons of this itemi use in a car and i found that after i turn on the car i have to go through this sequence to put it in the right mode press play button wait  seconds or so for it to scan the cd press the mode button to select shuffle modeit has a resume feature where it remembers the last song when it was turned off
unfortunately it does not remember the shuffle mode
very annoyingalso there is no light on the lcd display
but i guess its ok because there isnt much to see on the segment digit display anyway looks like calculator displaybtw my unit came with a defective car cassette adapter
only the right channel has sound
i hope there is a repair center near me because i dont want to return the whole thingi have no other complain
overall i still prefer it over my cassette playermy wrists have been bothering me and i was told this was a good way to go
fairly easy to set up
the receiver is large and has poor range
i thought i could get much further away then two feet without seeing performance issues
it doesnt seem to matter where i place the receiver it just doesnt like my mouse getting too far away
i have a large hand and it would be nice if there was more area on the mouse for my palm to rest comfortably on
have been using it for several days and wrists seem to be less irritable
if i had to choose again i would go with the cheaper wired versionthe one piece of wisdom one should take away from the trackball issue is that every hand fits their gear differently
you probably wouldnt be reading this if you were completely satisfied with the mouse that came with your computer but logitechs incredibly popular trackman wheel work doesnt equally well for with all userswith the possibly exception of the kensington orbit trackball its hard to find a device that feels so custom molded to your hand
your thumb is in charge of cursor movement while two sensitive clickers combine seamlessly with a scrollwheel
it may take some accomodation until you feel completely at home with the trackman and lefties are left out of the equationcursor movement isnt equally easy for everyone
on my mac with updated drivers it took three or four scrolls to get from one part of the screen to the other and this quickly became exasperatng its probable that the windws implementation is more successful
equally problematical the thumbs positioning didnt provide the same level of sensitive movement as my fingers making navigation slowerlegitechs software is where the trackman is least satisfactory
the kensington software allows considerable flexibiity of use offering considerable accuracy
logitechs software frankly is only rudimentary with basic speed control as your only optionthe trackman is more perfectly fitted to the dimensions of the human hand than any major trackball ive yet tried and there are times when you may find an effortless cursor novememt
to offer this at such a reasonable price makes this doubly attractive to anyone who values good looks in an outout device
the device is so comfortale that a few users have been affected by stiffness if used for long periods you are sttrongly urged to stretch regularly in order to avoid tendon stiffnessall in all its an attractivelooking device that demands preuse with a comoyter
theres every chance that youll fall in love with the trackman but it may prove all but unusable with the wrong systemthis is generally an ok product but it seems to me logitech have gotten it backwards
the ball should be controlled using the moresensitive fingertips and the wheel controlled with the lesssensitive thumb
ive used a logitech marble ball controlled with the fingers and found it much easier to use  too bad i couldnt find a cordless version with a thumbcontrolled wheeli had this trackball for  years with an xp machine and no problemsbest trackball ever  not too big and glides well
when i got a vista machine it would automatically stop working after a few power downs
i have to keep the computer plugged into a surge protector and as long as the power stays on the mouse is fine
but if i power goes out from a storm then i have to unplug the trackball wireless module and either reinstall or hope it decides to work again
my computer just went into standby and the mouse was not working anymore again
i had to reinstall it again
ive checked my bios power settings and the vista power settings
there is not much else i can do
dont use this for vista is all i can say
it crashes all the time and doesnt like other usb devices except my keyboard  printer
new vista drivers dont help either
great for xpits an ok mouse
it would have been better had it been like the logitech revolution rechargable mouse and have a charger and not have to use batteries
the wireless node is a lil large but not too terribly large that its unusablehmmmm
for a product that works off of radio frequency i would expect that it wouldnt matter what direction i pointed the trackball but i found that with this product you have to point it in the general direction of the receiver
not as bad as a infrared remote such as a tv remote but less than what i expected
i am using it at a distance of about ft away from the receiver
if you are just using it as a regular desktop trackball it would probably work finethis model is slightly better than its predecessor and unfortunately also still better than its replacement having owned an old trackman marble ps as well as the wireless trackball m i can say that this is my favorite device of the three and i would definitely recommend this product over either of the othersin terms of sheer ergonomics the older trackman marble is slightly superior being that it puts slightly less strain on your wrist which is a key feature for anyone who is switching to a trackball from a mouse due to wrist strain as i was
unfortunately that device is less precise and requires more frequent cleaning of the ball sensors which is very impossible to do without unscrewing the bottom of the mouse
this and the later model can be easily cleaned simply popping the ball out via a hole underneath slightly more convenient in the later model which generally is not necessary to do as frequently as the older modelthe m in contrast is the most precise of the  and features some handy extra buttons which combined with its sleek design would make it an ideal product but for  fatal design flaws the first of which is that the case is too small to comfortably rest your palm on the surface causing the very kind of wrist strain that many were trying to avoid in switching to a trackball from a mouse
the second is related an arguably even worse the sensitivity and position of the right context button which is not easily able to be reconfigured to anything except a simple swap with the leftprimary button is such that you will accidentally be clicking the context button constantly simply by resting your hand on the only part of the device that you can
this makes the device unbelievably annoying and virtually unusable despite its improvementsso i have to recommend this device as the best in this series and definitely a decent product if youre looking to eliminate wrist strain but id definitely recommend the corded model unless you like swapping out batteries constantlyps
i recently discovered that what was actually causing my wrist strain was not the fact that i was using a mouse but the kind of mouse i was using
it seems that the newer kind of mice which allowforce you to rest your entire palm on the surface are actually the cause
therefore by switching back to an older logitech mouse a ps corded mouseman wingman gaming mouse httpamazoncomlogitechbuttonwingmangamingmousedpbzhrrefcmcrmrtitle  i was able to circumvent the need for a trackballthese work great for as long as they lastthe transmitter that plugs into the computer usb port always fails after   to  years of service
if they lasted longer i would have given it a five star ratingive had three of these things over the years because they are so comfortable and ergonomic
wish logitech would sell replacement transmitters so i didnt have to buy a complete new product every two yearsi have never cared for trackballs in the slightest and when working as an it tech found that whenever i discovered one in use it would always slow me down somewhat
i purchased this for my mom who had always used one and preferred it to a conventional mouse
but although it was a logitech and of the usual fine quality she ended up abandoning it and going back to a mouse
i can see the advantages of having a small desktop or a hand that just prefers that motion but there is no doubt many reasons why mice are standard issue and have been not trackballsi got this product and i was all excited about getting it
the convenience of being a distance away from the computer and being able to use the mouse was great
after a few months it began to drain the batteries very quickly within  days
i tried changing batteries rechargeable and alkaline both with same disappointing results
unfortunately i had to dispose of it
got a corded one instead and it works like a charmthis wireless mouse uses a usb sending unit that is quite large for what it does
i discovered the hard way that the little lines on the usb receiver mean that the pointy end of the device needs to be aimed at the trackball mouse
i had it mounted with velcro to the back of my computer and it wouldnt work at all
i moved it to the side and it wouldnt work until i aimed it at the place on my desk where the trackball was located
since then no problems
i dont think it has enough range so the new blue wireless trackball with the tiny usb dongle is going to be a big improvement
hopefully it has more range
i wish i had waited a couple of months to purchase a wireless trackball mousei had the original trackman wheel mouse with a cord and loved it
i regretted letting my motherinlaw have it the very second i agreed to iti purchased this one as a replacement once i realised i didnt like a normal mouse any more
plus i purchased a laptop and thought the cordless would be handythis model works excellent and is great for use at home with a desktop computer
unfortunately it doesnt mention in the description or photo that the receiver which plugs into the usb port is huge its almsost as big as the mouse itself
the size of the receiver and length of cord that comes with it is the same as having a mouse completely defeating most of the purpose of a cordless mouse
it is too bulky to carry around and setup on my laptop like i had hoped
the receiver is much larger than the ones that come on the other cordless mice i have seenif you like the trackman wheel i highly recomend this one it is top quality and functions flawlessly as long as you dont want to rely on portability
if you plan on carrying it with your laptop i would recomend a different cordless mouseproduct works ok but there is a small black speck on outer edge of field of view
probably just my bad luck
maybe should have returned it but will just live with iti own a meade etxec and it comes standard with the straight through finder
as most etx owners will testify it is utterly hopeless for anything astronomical
meade should be ashamed of putting this useless finder on their otherwise cool scopes
you can purchase the right angle finder as an extra which comes standard on the etxec and locating objects manually will be dramatically easier although not  suitable
its a relatively expensive purchase but will make your viewing time that much more enjoyable
check out mike weasners site for the best information on etxs and alternative finder scopes
recommended but check out alternatives alsoi was really confused i ordered a tadapter for my telescope a mead etx for my canon ti
what i got was the part that actually attaches to the telescope
not the tring i needed for my canon ti camera
this part does me no good without the specific tring adapter for the removablelens
the item shown looks like one piece not two and does not tell you that you need the other adapter piece to use it
make sure you do some research before you buy this item
because you need more than just one part to make it worki know i was really confused on what i would need to do this
but i figured it out so i thought that i would let you all know
first of all you need to get the correct tadapter for your telescope for the etxat  at the st for the etx and higher you need the  that is part that actually atteches to the telescope
then you need a tring that fits your specific mm slr removeablelens camera
you should be able to get a tring at any camera reseller store for around the only other thing that meade suggests is using a cableoperated shutter release cord
you should be able to get this on amazon through your camera manufacuar or an autorized camera reseller
i have not yet recieved my st adapatr and tring i will write a review after i try them outmy m is a nice reliable little unit
if you  are looking for something conveniently small to use for basic functions such as names and addresses appotintments and maybe the calculator  sure it is great
the screen on this series though is very small and coupled with its low memory capacity meg the m does have its limitations
yes you can run many other applications on it but again its small screen size depending on the application can be a problem
like all palms its hot sync capability runs flawlessly with a pc
the backlight on the m like many other palms in my humble opinion is pretty useless unless you are in the pitchblack
i havnt seen a backlight anywhere as efficient as the one on my trusty apple newton messagepads of a few years ago and the m is no different
all in all a capable little unit for running basic applications and the its small overall size and screen size can be a plus or minus depending on how you plan to use this pdathis palm is ok because it is not color and after time the digitizer breaks the part that makes it so you can use the touch screen feature if i were you i would get the m  it is color and not as old  it is very good for schoolfor many people who are currently jumping on to the pda bandwagon you really cant go wrong with this little device
depending on how you look at it when it comes to pdas generally what you pay for is what you get
this holds true for the m
it will do pretty much everything every other palm will do
the only difference is that you have only about mb of storage space compared to the mb most palm units will have now
also the other main difference is that instead of a cradle this unit has a plug in type of syncits a great gift to give someone considering how much you can get them these days
its a great entry level pdaas a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any pda
dont believe the pocketpc ads or even the palm ads
talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who arent on palms or microsofts payroll
unfortunately they will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to knowgood luck
overall again this is a good introductory palm for those who dont have any type of pda
again it really depend on your needs in a pda
if all you need is a place to write telephone numbers keep a calendar a to do list and maybe a few games this would be adequate
however if you need to view documents ebooks web clippings spreadsheets and even listen to music you might want to go another direction
also be prepared to part with a few more dollarsthe best thing that can be said about the palm m is that it looks spiffy and is the cheapest palm model on the market
however the cons far outweigh the pros for this modelfirst of all the quotslightly smallerquot screen is a pretty big problem when you consider that the noncolor palms are hard enough to read to begin with
the fractional loss of display space makes the m more difficult to read than any other palm out theresecond only having  megs of memory is a real drag
one of the best reasons to use palms instead of windows pdas is the huge sofware library available for the palm os
with only  megs you limit yourself needlesslyin short i would not buy a m
were i short of cash or if i really wanted the interchangeable faceplates i would spend the tiny extra amount and get the m with  megs of memory which puts it on par with all of the other palms on the market
however i think you get more bang for your budget with handsprings at the  to  range since you get a slightly faster processor and the expansion port as well as cool colors to choose fromthe m and m use the serial port of your computer for hotsync w your computer
if you do not have a serial port on your newer laptop or computer you will need a  dollar serialusb adapter and it may give some software instalation problems like i had
if you do buy the serialusb adapter and get it to work it still wont sync as fast a native usb interfaceusb is a fastereasiertoplugandplaylessharwareconflicts standard
the highend palms use usb only but these cheaper ones dont  but theres still hope in the under  fieldthe handspring visor is another lowend yet slightly more expensive palmbased pda than this m but it uses usb to syncronize has a bigger screen and a silly expansion portbefore you get the m or m because its the cheapest check out how nice the cheapest visor is and check if your computer has usb serial or both
the worst thing is to have a palm that you are unable to sync with your computer because you cant back it up or add new softwarein other reviews i have slammed this product the m and the m for what i consider to be their fatal flaw  a small screen
i returned my m a gift after a week of squintingthe dropping prices suggest that the marketplace has spoken loud and clear and i hope that palm soon remedies its problems at the lowend of the market with a fullsized screen in a basic unit for under two hundred smackersi cant emphasize that enough
with a monochrome screen to begin with and the builtin difficulty of pointing and clicking on a palm device size mattershowever i have to admit that at these firesale prices the m is becoming a steal for folks who have missed out on the pda revolution because of the costmake no mistake with a little patience this is a device that will change your life
after a transition period you will be able to toss away your rolodexes i used to have three and your paper calendarsid recommend buying a handspring visor deluxe or the new visor neo for folks who want a fullsized screen although they now cost a bit more
they also have an expansion slot for adding everything from memory to a cell phone to gps
you will also need mb the m model only comes with mb if you want to run some of the cooler downloadable programs for your palm
three free programs that i use all the time include mapopolis free maps from mapopoliscom streets are searchable vindigo a restaurant and city guide with movie reviews and showtimes at vindigocom and avantgo a news service where you can get the likes of the new york times the weather channel and cnn on your palmif you want to stay with palm but can spend a bit more consider the palm v although lacking in expansion slots it comes in asuperslim package with a rechargeable lithium battery and a fullsize screen
i also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy expandable new m but in that price range i think a pocketpc might make more sense

the other things that i consider to be major problems are the memory is much too low at  and the type is much too small if you have any tendancy toward farsightedness dealing with this screen would be a nightmare
the stylus does not have a reset pin and there isnt a replacement that has one really i have this so that my son can use it for school and i use a handspring visordeluxe
if this was my primary pda i would have a big problem with iti bought it for mounting the etrex vista garmin gps onto the bike rails but the rails turned out too thick and the mount didnt fit
had to buy the adapter to make it fitas stated in many other reviews the new battery back mount wont fit on micro sd garmins without altering it yourself
but the part that attaches to your bicycle works great
my garmin came with a screwon attachment so i didnt need the new back and everything worked out fineif you have the little screw on mount that should have come with garmin originally then this mount will work for you if not dont botherforget this device if youre looking for a mount for the etrex 
it does not work on those devicesi got this to work with my vista cx on my bike
it does work but only the bar clamp itself is needed for that model of gps
the vista cx comes with a fitting to use with the stock batterypack cover that is better than the one you get with this clamp
i was warned that the replacement battery cover that comes with this will not allow space for the sd card and since the gps is useless without it thats no good
also the stock cover is rubberized to keep water out which this one is not
dont use this battery cover use the one that comes with the cx
maybe other models require this battery cover and dont interfere with the memory cardsso the package costs more than it should for users with this gps
i got a second one directly from garmin for less since it only had the clamp
to be fair though this clamp puts the gps futher forward on the bar than the other one i got which keeps it out of the way of your knee when climbing out of the saddleive had this for   years now
it still snaps securely into place and holds the gps into the mounting clip
within the last  months it has sort of loosened up and is a little shaky when riding on rough pavement
it has never fallen out of the clip so i continue to use it
for the price however i did expect a little higher qualitywould probably work great but just a word of warning that it will not work with a etrex vista hcx even though it appears to be the proper shape
i found out the hard wayalthough the clamp holds really well and isnt an issue at all plus it really fits perfectly to my e trex the vibration from the bike causes the gps unit to reset or turn off rather easily
i know this isnt an issue with the product being reviewed however i think its a relevant note since i find it useless at this point and dont use my garmin for cycling any moreguess i should have read the fine print about needing that little plastic piece that came with the gps unit that screws onto the back of it oh well my bad
dont have that piece anymore gonna have to return it
however before i boxed it up i did have one thing to note
when the new cheap plastic gps back clips onto your handle bar mount its not a very good connection
it would be fine if youre road biking but if youre mountain biking i could imagine it would rattle around a lotif you have a newer garmin etrex gps with a microsd slot this bicycle mount will not work
you need to buy the garmin rail mount adapter instead
that product is cheaper and comes in  different sizes to fit skinny handlebars most mountain bikes and fat handlebars most road bikesgarmin rail mount adapter garmin large diameter rail mount adapter ive been using an etrex for hiking kayaking and biking pretty much since it came out and im still pretty much enamored of it
this adapter certainly makes it easy to use the etrex on your bike but i do have a few reservations about itthe adapter plate consists of a replacement for the battery compartment cover on the etrex and an adapter that clamps on to the handlebars with a screw
remove the stock cover slap on the replacement and its ready to clip on the bike
if you intend on only using the etrex on your bike this works pretty well
if you plan on using your etrex for more than one sport you may be changing covers back and forth regularly since the replacement cover doesnt fit easily in a shirt or pfd pocketwhile the regular battery compartment cover seals via a rubber coating over the entire cover the cover that comes with this adapter uses a skinny oring thats supposed to sit in a groove on the cover
the problem is that it pops out every time you remove the cover whether to change batteries or just to switch covers
its easy to drop the oring and its a bit of a fussy job to get it back in the groove
once sealed in it seems waterproof enoughsince my main use for my etrex is kayaking i finally decided to stick with the original cover and gave the adapter away to a friend
if you plan on using your etrex exclusively on a bike though this is definitely the way to gothe design is simple and effective a replacement for the battery cover clips securely into a handlebar mounted cradle
so far so good
the replacement battery cover like the original has a short metal post and crossbar pins to lock it onto the until
unfortunately the locking post on the replacement is oh so slightly too short visibly so with a straight edge laid across both covers and cannot be fully seated and therefore cannot be connected to the handlebar mount
i could probably force it but this would damage the plastic socket the post sits in
as an official garmin accessory i expected better tolerances
i returned my unit as defective which it was and will wait to see what the odds are of getting a working unit before reordering
i have the garmin etrexh which is exactly what i need for a simple handheld gps with long battery lifei also noticed that the original cover was made in taiwan which has excellent quality and the replacement was made in china which is improving
in addition the original cover has a thin rubber permanent gasket around the entire perimeter and the replacement gasket covered only about  of the perimeter
this would make the unit less waterproof while on my bike
this could also be a manufacturing defect and could even explain the short pin if the gasket is too thick on the portions it does coverthis carrying case is great for protecting your gps receiver a vista hcx in my case from scratches especially on the screen but it does have a problem that the plastic covering the screen is very reflective so i usually end up removing the carrying case under bright sunlight to be able to read the screen
i think this is a good product but having the need to remove it sometimes defeats its purpose
better go to a store and see it for yourself to see if its going to be a problem for youi bought this as a replacement for an older model of this item
this one is improved in terms of the design
the sides and bottom are stitched more squared off so it feels less bulky to hold
the one one was sort of roundish when the unit was inside which made it bulky
its still bulky compared to nothing but the construction is better on this model
they also improved the screen cover part
before the screen would be slightly obstructed by the cover but this model has a bigger area for the screenhowever some of the same problems persist
to me a snug fit is nice but its actually somewhat difficult to slide the unit into this
and repeated times going in and out can loosen the protective rubber sides of the actual garmin unit
this happened with my previous case and ive actually had to reglue the rubber on the unit
also the case comes very close to the small multidirectional button on the face of the unit
its harder to use this button with the case coming so close to it
the case should probably have a larger cutout area which leaves the button slightly more free to move
lastly i had to replace my old one because the stitching in the leather cover on the belt clip came undone
i did get a lot of use out of it and the product is inexpensive so its not that big a deal
but ill have to keep an eye on this for a similar problemoverall having this is better than nothing even if its not the greatest carrying caseedit  i just had to buy my rd one august  since owning the gps unit 
the problem is the stitching comes undone too easily on the clip with repeated clips and unclips to a strap on my backpack
the strap is woven nylon so its a typical material one would think this would clip to but after a year or so of clipping and unclipping to my bag the stitching breaks and it makes the thing darn near impossible to use
for the price its ok but its not great qualitythe case works well for the garmin etrex
but it is just a case  nothing particularly special
probably could have found another just as good for less money than the  this one costgarmin etrex case is a nice neoprene case providing a little protection for any etrex handheld gps but not a necessary case
it provides some protection for the screen but at the same time making the screen more difficult to read when the unit is wet
it does not provide its own tether relying on the tether attached to the etrex which must be threaded through a small hole in the case
but i still think it is worth getting just to give your etrex a little extra protectionit  fits but is far too snug
top flap pulls over but barely fits
tried to pull it a little farther and the seam began to teari bought this for my wifes gps and within the first day we quit using it
it adds unnecessary bulk and forget reading it with the sun overhead
i performs its intended purpose well but the glare and bulk just dont work for meit was clumsy and got in the way but i am not a hiker
the gps is so small that it fits in a pocket or is held by the lanyard just fine without this carrying case
the lanyard really got in the way when trying to stuff it into the carrying casevery good quality case that is wellworth the price
one minor problem with it is that the clear plastic window that one is supposed to view the gps screen through produces a lot of glare and scratches easily making it hard to see throughi purchased the carrying case which unfortunately slightly obscures the outer edges of the screen and generally makes the screen more difficult to read
other than that it get the job done keeping all the buttons easily accessiblefirst off this case should be included in the cost of the etrex  having to pay extra strikes me as wrongthat said this case is okay
i took it hiking with me and while it protected my etrex i dont trust the case to hold the unit safely
the velcro connects the top flap behind the etrex
the etrex fits in fairly snugly  almost too much so
i could see the etrex sliding out of the case on the trail and me hiking off leaving my costly unit behindwould i buy it again
yes if only to avoid the hassle of searching for a better caseill use the case but always carry it in my pocket  just to be safei dont really ever use it the gps is made of really good quality materialsit is crazy how overpriced this cable really is
it is crazy that i actually bought it
if you dont mind the price this cable is well made
i finally upgraded the firmware of my geko  with this cable
btw the bootleg version of this cable costs almost as much and probably costs more after you add the shipping cost
see what a crazy world we live inthis mouse is convenient but not as accurate as my oldfashioned mechanical ball mouse
sometimes it detects movement when my hand is not on the mouse strangethe price was the hook
but you might want to look at other newer modelsive found that optical mice are incredibly superior when compared to traditional ball mice
they effortlessly glide across your mousepad assuming that your surface isnt reflective or glossy at all then they tend to get a little confused
this mouse is a nice relatively inexpensive way to get that
as great as that seems the scroll wheel on logitech mice in general is pretty poor
its very choppy it sometimes goes several clicks before it decides to start scrolling and it often keeps going after youve stopped scrolling
it was very frustrating at first im now sadly used to itfirst i admit im a fan of microsoft mouses
but im not closedminded and do have in my possesion the logitech mouse pro traveler minimouse which i carry with my fujitsu notebooki got the wheel mouse optical blue as a gift from my exemployer as a pinkslip present
ok id rather keep the job but what the heck i dont decline freebiesthe wheel mouse is nice and stylish and is pure plugnplay on windows xp
you dont need to install the software although i imagine the logitech software gives you some customization functions
i never bother with customizing my mouses anyway just stick with the oneclick oneshortcutmenu and scrollupanddown basic functionsso the wheel mouse works very well on any surface just dont try it on glass since it wont pick up reflection right
its cool blue color turns heads at starbucks
but im not all happy with its ergonomics like many other logitech mouses including my prized mouse pro traveler your hand will get tired after about  minutes of use
of course your actual mileage can vary but the point is microsoft mouses are still more comfortable especially for people like me with large handsa simple mouse that is optical and slightly more money than its worth
there is nothing exceptional about this which makes it more compelling than the sevendollar generics at the computer store except perhaps for the logitech logo sticker
i am obsessed with the logitech logo sticker
its rubbery and im always picking at it for no apparent reason
the case of the mouse is made of that slippery matte finish and slips out of my hands probably because the mouse isnt for normal adult malesized handsif you can get it for seven bucks like the knockoffs go for it
definitely not worth twenty dollarsand whats with the very thin cablethe overall construction and quality seems good and i have the ifeel version so its a little bit heavier than other optical mice and the added weight seems better
however the scroll wheel is the  most glaring example of poor design and assembly ive seen in logitech products
the wheel is very notchy and requires way to much effort to use also the way in which the driver scrolls pages is inferior lots of jitters and unresponsive to my microsoft optical mouse and my razer boomslang mouse
i think ill be returning this oneoptical mice are great for the reasons everyone else is saying here
there are two annoyances with this product however
if your hands arent tiny the mouse will be too narrow
this is a problem because it is much more tiring and possibly painful to grip a narrow mouse over an extended period of time than it is to grip a wider one like the microsoft mice
the second annoyance is fairly trivialthe mouse emits a noisy clink that sounds a little cheap when you press the buttonsi got this mouse for a computer im building for my girlfriend i have both a cirque touchpad which is my absolute favorite pointing device and a microsoft intellimouse with optieye a discontinued optical mouse that is very nearly the same as their other optical mice
it is very comfortable and works greatif you ever experience any sorts of pain associated with mouse use i highly recommend using a touchpad instead
the benefits are that you dont have to grasp anything you can move the cursor with a very slight touch and you dont even have to beat the tips of your fingers up from constant clicking since the lightest of taps on the touchpad surface achieve the same result
in addition you can set a touchpad on or against your leg at the same angle that your hands naturally rest in at the side of your body rather than twisting them to the horizontal surface of a desk
the bottom line is that the tingle i was feeling in my hand wrist and lower arm from constant mouse use went completely away once i started using a touchpad
like an optical mouse there is never any cleaning or moving parts either which makes them much more reliable than other mice or trackballsthis is a nice mouse but i find it jerky when used a certain wood grained surface
i think my desk surface has a wood grain pattern that is difficult for the sensor to adapt to
but the microsoft optical mice work perfectly on this same desktop
other than that this is a good producti was given this as an unexpected amp thoughtful gift but after working with it a bit i dont think id chose the olympus again
one basic design flaw is that it doesnt stand up very well on its think rounded base
you can balance it but it will topple over at the slightest disturbance
i compared it with my friends panasonic rn which is substantially heavier but has a bigger better speaker amp is more stable
when i played my tape on her machine it seemed as if the microphones on both were comparablebut there arent a lot of cbers out there so it is hard to gauge the range and overall ability of the unit
but at this point it powers up and i get enough static and distant chatter to tell me it is reaching out and trying to do its job
cell phones have replaced cb radios and gone are the days when we all had a cb and loved chatting with friendly truckers
but im just whining i also miss my track tapesmaybe im doing something wrong but this thing makes a lot of noise but for some reason will not transmit
i had the antenna tuned and it worked then but now no one answers when i ask for a radio checkin daylight hard to read channel display
it does receive very well but cant push thru the garbage on it
better mic would do this radio a favor
unit came to me with no mounting screws mic clip and was missing screws that bolt it to mount
too cheap to try to get this problem rectified
used it one day and was told radio has low audio
practicly had to eat it to get out   mile
i will save some money and get a galaxy or another top brand
remember quality has gone down on all brands made in far east
hard to get an american company that still builds radios
also truck stops sell this for  or more and amazon charges lot lessthis radio was good when it worked
the speaker would work when it wanted to and the display stopped working in less than  days
the range was more than expected it could hear real well
returned the radio for a refund and decided to go with a more higher end radio galaxy dxi purchased an olympus camera for my parents that was only a  mgpix and then did some research and thought that the dc would be better
i have used both and the olympus by far has taken better pictures for half the price and almost have the pixels
my dc takes better indoor pictures without the flash even though the camera tells me to use flash
indoor quality is lacking compared to outdoor
the olympus also captures action shots better than the dc as well
everyone has rated this camera well
maybe there is something wrong with minethis probably depends a lot on your paint type but mine kind of comes unstuck sometimes
i think it might be when i am messing with the cords and give it a little tug on accident
it definitely isnt a very firm hold on my walls
it looks nice though and i painted it the same color as my wall so hides nicelythese held my wires together perfectly but as soon as i moved and had to take them off it was extremely hardnot to mention that i ripped off a chunks of paint along with some of the wall due to the adhesivethe kit has most of what is needed but i found that more elbows to go with the amount of tubing provided would be helpful
also this is not the wide sheilding so if you want to hide all your wires under one this is not the right kitit was nice to have this to hide the few wires i still had hanging around my wall mount tv and fireplace area
most of the cables were run through a special molding i built into the wall when it was rebuilt but some wires just cant do that for accessibility reasons
it keeps coming unstuck from the wall and has to be put back up not like daily but a stronger adhesive might be better
the only other negative about this product is that it would be nice to have more of the corner and angle pieces or at least  of each for bigger projects
otherwise it does indeed hide the wires well and i was able to paint mine to match a very bright wall i might add so it goes unnoticed until it comes unstuck from the wall
good for the price a little stronger adhesive would be niceits what is says it is
but i wish it were more
i also with the description made everything a little more cleari bought  sets of these to conceal   gauge speaker wires for a  foot run
they held the cables with a little room to spare and they look very clean on top of my baseboard trim
the elbows and connectors are also nice
my wife is hard to please and she was very impressed with the cleanliness of the installmy problem isthey arrived slightly warped
i tried to straighten them out before installing but perhaps i didnt do a good enough job
 week after install  i found about  of my run has unstuck from the wall
i wiped the walls prior to install  so there was no dirt or debris of any sort i held them firmly in place to ensure a tight seal and i was very careful to allow enough slack on both ends of the cable to avoid excessive tension in the cable run
perhaps i was unlucky with a few batches
they definitely didnt tear off  layers of drywall like many other reviews suggestpros excellent product with easy installationcons too pricey and geared towards a very limited consumer marketconclusionsmarter to pend less at a department store for broader molding needed for thicker and multiple wiringi was going to use this for running the hdmi and power cords from my projector across the ceiling
unfortunately it is too small for my awg hdmi and awg power cables to both fit
these are a little thicker than normal cords but i only needed the two of them to fitprossticks to basically any surfacesnaps tightdoes the job for up to  thin cableseasily cuttable for tight spacesthe fittings they include for angles are greatconsit will take the paint and top layer of your drywall off upon removali struggled to fit an hdmi and power cable from my ceiling mounted projector through thisnot reusable once removedlike lots of other customers i had not read the specs before my purchase and expected it to let me take instant snaps well i was wrongtheres that delay before the camera firesbut what sets me apart from many of the customers here is that i like using the mirror up function for pictures with a long telephoto lensthe delay that you get between the raising of the mirror and the firing of the camera is just not long enough especially if you are doing a vertical frameas you require about  seconds to have the camera really stablewell its not the infrared controllers fault its the camerasthis is like my th eyecup for my canon d mkii
the eyecup just slides off too easily and later you pick up your camera and it is gone
thinking about putting some rubber cement or something to hold it in place but not be permanentthis fits my ti fine but it is not exactly like the original
still recommend but a little diappointed that it was not an exact replica stars since this part should not have to exist
easy to bump off while carrying your camera which is waht happened to mineive been using this transmitter for over  years and it does a good job but it doesnt handle obstacles very well even indoor
i love the fact that it helps you focus even in extremely dark situations very handy even when you are not going to trigger a flash
ive use it with canon and metz flashes and they both work great with it you can graduate power between flashoverall its ok especially because you dont need receivers connected to the flash
i wouldnt recommend it if you take most of your pictures outdoorsee updated notes at bottom
first off awesome ideaunfortunately the idea wasnt perfectedgetting your camera off the flash has gotten much easier over the years  wireless triggers ettl cables hotshoeslaves pcsync cables you name itthe problem is getting that flash to carry ettl wirelessly
so far only a few transmitters do it and theyre all very expensive requiring not only a transmitter but also a receiver for each flash
thats where this little guy steps inthe ste pops in your hotshoe and wirelessly triggers your canon flashes with slaves
the first problem here is the canon part  unlike the other options which work with any brand of flash this one works with the canon system
if you only own canon flashes no problem
if you own a mix youve got a problem the canons dont come cheap
the next problem is that its line of sight based
this means it has to be able to see the other flashes
not so much of a problem indoors itll bounce off walls and generally hit the flash but outdoors youll have issues
sunlight especially causes signal loss and especially using multiple flashes its not something you want to have to rely on youll spend time either trying to correct it making sacrifices or not notice that half your flashes didnt fire which would be too lateif you already own a masterslave flash like some canon exiis try that on wireless mode to see how well it works outdoors that should give you an idea of what to expect from this
unfortunately with it being unreliable i just cant recommend it for anyone planning to use it outdoors
indoors you should be fine but is it the option you need or would a cheap transmitter or sync cable do the same job for younext problem is the battery  for some odd reason i cant understand they decided to use nonstandard batteries
no aa or v here weve got a cr here
have a bunch of these lying around
chances are you dont and  youll want spares for when you need to replace itone very cool thing about it is that it has focus assist  thats the little red pattern that the canon flashes use to help you focus in lowlight situations
if you dont need to use the flash you can still use this thing to help focus in darker locations without needing to mount a highflash on top
i know ive used my exii as a focusassist tool not using the flash output so having this much smaller option is very nice
the question is is it worth the asking price
for me i say no
for you maybe it isthere are much better options out there  if you just need wireless pick up a transmitterreceiver combo for th the price of this
if you need ettl spend x the price of this and get one of the new pocketwizards and a receiver  the extra range and not having to fight with getting a lineofsight is worth it in the long runupdate a rd party manufacturer yongnuo has since released their version of the ste transmitter
costing a bit less than the canon model its nearly identical but with some improvements including longer range autofocus assist beam and transmitter beam ability to swivel leftright runs of  aa batteries
while still not perfect the yongnuo version is a considerable improvement and one i can actually recommend if youre using ettli really like this transmitter dont get me wrong
but frankly i mostly do automotive shoots and it can get quite limiting namely because the ir sensors have to be facing each other which means that you have to move the flash positions to face the camera and transmitter each time you change your lighting set upit also means you can be creative and put a flash behind a car or wall as the signal wont reach behind obstacles of any kind
i would invest in a pocket wizard system which is much better which is what im saving up for now
but this is nevertheless a decent item to have if you have some canon flashes and want to experiment with wireless flash set upsi have not been able to use it yet as it needs a special battery cr it also arrived with no manual and no warranty card
i know i can download the manual and i can probably register online but why should the onus be on me
i hope it works as advertised
it is aggravating to get a new gadget that cannot be used immediatelywell i was very apprehensive about buying this item as it was overpriced typical canon salesi was very surprised with the unit make sure you buy a cr batterythe unit is very easy to control you set the flash to slave and attach the ste to the camera hot shoe and lock it into position switch the unit on and you are now ready to use the uniti wish i had bought one at the same time as my ex flash i have been using the canon oce off camera shoe cord for a while and have recently hacked it so i can extend the flash a distance of ftthe ste wireless transmitter frees you of the hassle of cables and it is great indoors with off camera flash per the strobist techniquesoutdoors might be a slight problem with distance and depending on how bright the day is when trying to use it radio poppers or the pocket wizards are probably the way to go but with the canon ste you do retain full ettlif you are requiring further distances and already have this product then radio poppers would compliment this however they are more expensive than pocket wizards but they do retain the full canon ettl systemi wish canon would come out with an updated model to this so that it would be a radio trigger and not opticalat least with pocket wizards and the correct cords you can trigger the camera remotely or the flash if need beif youre on a tight budget then go with pocket wizards straight away as the system is expandable they are more expensive than this unit but youre not limited to one brand of flash either a lot of photographers are using the vivitar hv brand of flashes with pocket wizards and are getting great resultshope this review helpsupdate i now own pocket wizard flex tts and canon dthe ste is no longer requiredim not impressed for several reasons the build quality is poor feels more like a toy compared with the flashes the thing didnt come with a battery and uses an obscure battery type there is no sealing or locking mechanism for the hot shoe youll put it on a  flash but not a  transmitter no second curtain control this is a big boooo to canon in general who has turned their back on pro strobists and advanced hobbyists alikenot sure im going to keep it rather than spend  on a  foot ebay oce cable that will maintain my rear curtain and doesnt need line of sightcome on canon get with the gamepros affordable way to have remote wireless triggering unbelievably efficient battery life very straightforward and easy to learn the controls very lightweightcons unsatisfactory range has to be within view of the slave light source any small obstructions between transmitter and receiver results in communication lossthis is a fun transmitter to fool around with when just starting out with wireless triggering and studio shooting
but unfortunately after just a few times of using it i outgrew its pretty meager capabilities
unless you shoot a lot in nightclubs or small events i highly recommend that you instead save up more money and invest in pocket wizardsthis a good looking bag and well made
beyond that it is a joke
in the discription it states that it will hold two bodies and six lens
this i would love to see
i was just able to house my d with a  attached
had to remove walls and lay the camera down
my  would not stand up and again it had to lay down
my flash unit has to be laid on top of the  the room that was left houses cf cards batteries and remote controlthere is no room what so ever for my  lens
the bag really should be higher in order to stand up long lensanother bag that doesnt do the jobso if you have one body and all short lens this may be the bag for youjust some examples to know what size of bag you are buyingit didnt fit my canon d with the battery grip and the mm attachedsame thing about my canon d with the battery gripbut finally will fit me canon dor  powershot cameravery high quality bag but it was purchased for a dslr
the camera and a normal lens leaves little to no room for much else
it would be great for a point and shoot camera
as far as delivery it was quick and painlessthis bag is pretty nice quality and the front clip is great love that it is metal not plastic but it is too small and just will not fit more than  lens comfortablyi ended up returning it for the slightly bigger amazon brand but i think the build quality on this bag is much better it just doesnt fit things as welli purchased this based on the description provided by canon
i noted the size and compared it to my previous case ive had for  years
the stated size was close to my old case
canon stated even on the tag attached to the bag that you can get two camera bodies and three or four lenses and a few other accessories
let me correct that i have a ti and two lenses in the main section with dividers
there is no more room for anything
interior padding takes up a lot of the dimensions
this is good but canon needs to be honest in what can fit
this bag is essentially the same size as the eg which has the side pouches for  not enough added features to justify the extra cost
but for one body and two lenses its not bad
quality is excellent
size is convenient for hiking or long walks
the waist strap is one feature that i thought would be good preventing the bag from flopping as you hike
the shoulder strap is not the most comfortable but ok for tall people the shoulder strap might be a little short
the padded section is sewn in place not adjustable
for the price its merits three starsjust big enough for a body with lens mm and shorter the charger extra cf cards and thats about it
a basic great grab and go bag that will not attract attention on the street much but gets the job done
still kinda smallish so get a full size bag to carry your whole set up
this has good padding to protect your stuff but it is kind of a tight fit
good for the guy on the go thoughas with virtually all canon products the quality of this bag is excellent
were i to rate it based upon this alone i would give it  stars
however i purchased it based upon the dimensions clearly listed on amazons site and when it arrived it is just as clearly listed on the tag as being a critical  inches smaller
hence the item i purchased to store in it doesnt fit
i would have sent it back but it turns out it will fit my digital slr with lens attached
yet even there my camera is the compact pentax istd and i only have that one lens
those alone will fill up the bag
as another reviewer noted there is no way that the amount of equipment that the description claims will fit in it actually would
its a case of buyer beware
great bagbut only for smaller itemsi bought this bag for my canon eos rebel ti and it barely fits the camera body and kit lens
the camera bag construction is nice and overall a nice bagthis bag is good only too smalli bought this to try out with my nikon digital slr camera and it still felt too bulky for my camera and lens  it just didnt work for methe bag seemed to be wellconstructed and had a nice easily accesible zipper pocketif youre looking for something small this might not be the best option if you arent as concerned about size its a great buygood product and solid build quality
looks very good
wanted to really keep it and tried hard to accomodate my canon eos d with efs mm f attached
if you take the lens apart from the body  you can store bothbut not attached
plus not enough room left to store accessories battery charger cables filters etc
didnt fancy taking off the lens everytimeso had to return it and got the canon deluxe eg backpack insteadi prefer my tamrac explorer  dslr bag  but to be fair i got this canon bag to hold a bunch a extras that id accumulated for my s is and in that capacity it functions quite wellthis is a great bag but the tag says you could put  camera bodies and  lenses
maybe one or the other
i used to store a rebel xsi with the kit lens and the mm zoom and it fit ok then i bought a mm f lens and managed to squeeze it in its such a small lens that it actually fits almost anywhere
after a while i got a mm lens and since i only put the lenses in the bag and i carry the camera inside my backpack without any protection as all that gear doesnt fit inside the bag as expectedthe bag is very good but its small
if it actually held all the stuff it was supposed to it certainly would get  starsfirst id like to say that this bag is well constructed and offers great protection to my camera and accessories
with that being said i must also say that im not a big fan of the bulky shape
when carrying this bag with the long shoulder strap which itself is very awkward and uncomfortable it feels huge
i guess this could be good for people who need to carry more accessories
i just find myself leaving the bag in the car when i take my camera out which kind of defeats the purpose
also the clasp closure gets twisted sideways and sticks and the zipper is not the easiest to access
opening and closing the case is a little difficultconclusion good quality too bulky for everyday use in my opinioni returned this camera bag shortly after i received it because it wasnt exactly what i was looking for
the product itself is perfectly fine and does as it describes
it may be a bit small but is not advertised to be a large camera bag
this bag is great for carrying and storing your camera and one or two lenses but that is about it
what i was looking for was a bag that would allow me to easily access my camera and i found that in a different camera bagthis bag is ok at best
its very bulky and difficult to use swapping lenses and stuff
the bag is super cheap though and a great starter
i would go with a better bag in the future once you get used to the camera
this one gets the job done but its definitely not a long term bagalso the straps it offeres are very useful
i strapped it to the back of a snowmobile when i went up north and it did a fine job
its exceptionally durableid recommend this more for the mirrorless smaller cameras than i would for a dslrfor the price i think its good
space is lacking if you have a dslr camera
material is good so case is well madethe picture makes it look bigger
pay attention to the y sizes
it worked for me but my camera barely fitits a good unit but the price is a bit rough to swallow even though its fairmy unit seems to work well  of the time but the other  it either fails to fire or its exposure driftsthe build feels weak specifically the corda note before you order this unit it requires an adapter ring to mount to your lens so make sure you get the right bought this flash for my canon digital rebel xt
had the same results asthe built in flash so i returned it
may work better with a differentcamerathis little flash is fine for what it does
i ordered it without really checking carefully and found it couldnt do bounce flash so i gave it to my son and ordered the ex ii which does have a moveable flash head so you can bounce
if bounce isnt an issue for you its a nice inexpensive little flashcant understand why it doesnt work with the canon d but does with many other canon cameras
there seems to be no wireless remotes for the d
it does work fine with the xti enjoy using the canon wireless remote control rc
the only drawback is that it is a lineofsight controller and it needs to be in front of the camera to operate properly
the canon radio control remote is more handy and can operate from behind the camera and for greater distances but the radio control remote cost moreworked fine until i dropped it
youd think it could survive a four foot dropcanon wireless remote control rc for digital rebelif you are going to use this to take your own picture make sure that you hold it discreetly other wise it is very obviuos that you are using a remotethis remote is great for self or family portraits

please note all use of this remote testing and use was on a canon digital rebel xti camera using the included mm kit lens and a canon mm  lens on a tripod in raw mode at iso  your results may varyoverviewi bought this remote to trip the shutter while taking photos of birds at my bird feeder without being next to the camera and to trip the shutter when shooting fireworks and taking astrophotography photos of the night sky moon and stars etc
having to be in front of the camera to take a photo is one of the biggest problems i have
i bought this so i could be behind the camera and away from the birds so i would not scare them
why didnt canon put a sensor on the back of the camera
or make this a radio controlled sensorselftimer mode to usethe other problem is having to put the camera in timer mode to use it
after you put the camera in timer mode and you are using the remote on immediate exposure mode it will indeed take the photo when you press the button
however if you are in the timer mode and you happen to be up next to the camera and see a bird at the feeder and press the cameras shutter button you will rudely find that the camera is in timer mode and will not take the photo for  seconds
you have to use the remote to get an immediate exposuresleep modealso if you wait too long to take the shot the camera will go back into sleep mode
guess what
you cant wake up the camera using the remote
you have to walk up to the camera scare all the birds away press the cameras shutter button to wake up the camera then the remote is active againuse a mirrori did find a round about way to take exposures of the birds from behind the camera by propping a mirror up in front of the camera and aimed back at the camera
the remote signal would bounce off the mirror and back and the camera and worklow light astrophotography etcanother problem is photography in low light conditions
the exposure is ok in bright light but when using the remote in the dark while the camera is on a tripod i have found the illumination from the remote is bright enough to affect the camera meter and therefore underexpose what you are taking a photo of when shooting astrophotography etc  therefore i am going to have to either return this wireless remote and purchase the wired remote or keep this remote for self portraits and also buy a wired remote
please note you cant see the light from the remote but the cameras meter must be able toself portraitsi thought this was were the little remote would shine but guess what
you have to point the stupid thing at the camera for it to work
you look a little weird in a self portrait holding this little remote in your hand and trying to point it at the camera without being conspicuous
i think its actually better to use the cameras built in timerlow light photography exposurei thought i could use this remote to trigger my photos when i use the mirror lockup function so the camera would not shake
guess what
the mirror lockup mode does not work when using the remote
when you trigger the camera using the remote it takes a photo normally with the exposure happening immediately after the mirror goes up causing the image to blur anyway updatei have a new canon d mark ii on order and i heard that it can use this remote
that probably means that the new d when it comes out will be able to use this remote
will let you know when i get the d mark ii if this is soi purchased this remote for my canon ti
it is an infrared remote which is the root cause of my two complaints about this remote
first thing i noticed when trying to use it that you had to be accurate when pointing it
you couldnt just aim it in the general direction of the camera
even though i thought i had it pointed at the camera there were many times when it didnt work and sometimes i almost had to aim it like a gun
sort of defeats the purpose of being in the picture if you are aiming a remote at the camera
it does have a two second delay option which allows you time to hide the remote once you fire it assuming your aim was accurate
to be fare i didnt check the battery to see if it had a full charge
i assumed it did because it was newthe other bad thing about this remote is you have to be in front of the camera to make it work
if you are using your camera on a tripod and want to use a remote to minimize shaking this remote is not for youi gave it three stars because it does work and if all you want it for is to get yourself in the picture then it will work for you
but i think there are less expensive options out there
im going to get a wireless remote that is not dependent on accuracy of aim and will also work regardless of where i am in relation to the camera as long as im within range which seems to be  for most wireless remotesi usually mount my camera on a tripod when shooting wildlife with a long lens
to further steady the shot i got this wireless remote so that my hands do not need to touch the camera and introduce some shakes
but the receiver of the d is on the front while i am usually behind the camera
this means shooting is a bit awkward as i would have to arch my arm over the camera or around the tripod before clicking the remotefor group shots that include me this remote is perfect
but for the purpose i got it for i guess the wired remote would be betterthis is an ok remote
we use it with my wifes rebel xti
it gets the job done eventually
it doesnt always take the shot when you want it to so youll end up with some interesting photos
its better than setting the timer and running to you spot thoughthis infrared switch requires no setup on supported cameras but is only usable at limited angles and unlike the shutter on the body does not reset the cameras countdown to standby modeon myrebel ti the only setup was switching the camera to selftimerremote shooting mode and setting a switch on the remote to either immediate or sec delayunfortunately the placement of the receiver and the size of my lenses makes it such that theres a very small arc within which the remote will trigger the shutter on the first try
id normally position the camera at some kind of angle rather than headon on a tripod mount so the lens further blocks the receiver on the camera making the usable angle even smaller
i usually ended up waving my hand around and having to press the button a halfdozen times per pose before finding an angle that worked
as such i cant effectively use the seconddelay mode since im not sure if a single button press has actually registeredworse than the limited angle is that the remote trigger wont act like the shutterrelease on the camera
that is the remote doesnt wake the camera from sleepmode and doesnt seem to reset the inactivity timer like using the shutterrelease does
i could turn off sleep mode while using the switch but thats something else to remember to do and to reset again later lest the battery drain off unnecessarily
since this remote is officially supported on this camerabody it seems an oversight and a major inconvenience to not have it at least be able to wake the camerathis remote switch is a good idea but its design limitations make it useful very few circumstances
ill keep this remote in my kit but will try out thewired remote switchwith an extension cable as an alternativei purchased this as a gift for christmas but i tried it out to make sure it worked correctly before wrapping it
i am not overly impressed although it works well in front of the camera not that great as a remote trigger to prevent shake on a tripod when you are behind the cameraneat little gadgetuse it when i need to sit on the floor photographing toddlers
do not like the fact that it has to be pointed directly in front and to the same side as the sensor
i have not been able to get mine to work from the side or from behind and not very far away at all
amazon was by far the best priced outlet and it was low cost enough to be considered a waistthe wireless remote works as described
my only issue is you can only use it from the front because of the cameras sensor placement
as a landscape photographer i spend the majority of my time behind the camera composing my image
therefore i have to move my hand awkwardly to the front
however if youre looking to be in photographs and youre no more than  feet its a good buyi bought this switch thinking it would trigger my camera in movie mode
it only works in picture mode
maybe i missed something in the description
it would be nice if it was about  feet longive used this switch and found that it does not always work
i havent figured out what caused it to miss but i usually keep firing until it trips the camera
its okay for the priceswitch is ok really wanted a wireless remote but this will do for now it comes in handy and helps to steady my shotcanon remote switch rs eworks as designed functional and light weight
provides good control for a wired device and is easy to carry aroundthe amazon product description says this switch works with canon eos cameras but it only works with some eos cameras
my canon d mark ii takes an entirely different remote switch
you need to go to the canon website and find out which remote switch your camera uses before ordering this switchthis switch is great for photos with high zoom or long exposuresjust pressing on the shutter can move the camera and make the image blurunfortunately it does not start or stop video recording in video mode with the sx and of course  there is no zoom controlthis camera really needs a remote for zoom control because just touching the control makes the camera shakei bought this to be able to take exposures at night that would make the camera shake if i tried to push the shutter by hand
it is a fairly simple device that plugs into a port on the camera side and acts as the shutter release button
it can also be locked into an open position for long timed shots or for continuous shootingthe problems i found were that it is made of inexpensive materials and it functions properly only with great care
i used it for the first time to take some photos of trains passing
i didnt need the lock downjust to be able to release the shutter and let go to be able to take the pictures i was trying to get
on several of the attempts the device locked open and went into continuous shot mode
even when pulled out of the forward lock mode and with the finger off the trigger it still stayed in that position
in all of the cases where this happened i had to shut off the camera and turn it back on to get the thing to work properlywhile i havent seen a better release device for my camera i have to believe there is one and am looking now
this will work for you but beware as it seems to develop a mind of its own at timesi bought the canon remote switch because of need
what i wanted was a wireless remote
why canon doesnt offer a wireless remote is puzzling and frustrating
i am a loyal canon customer but this was a stupid decision on their part
it works perfectly well and is nicely made but its not wireless so i will never be satisfiedwas looking for a remote switch for my canon t
this is what you would expect works fine
price was good
only complaint is that i wish the cord was just a little longer
however reading the specifications prior to buying i knew it was going to be shorterits almost useless with how short the cord is
works fine but cord is soooo short
if it was longer i would give  starsthe quality is good but the switch isnt in too good a position
if the release were on the end it would be easier to useim sure everybodys review mentions this aspect but the cord doesnt let you walk far enough away
ive used it for simple marketingstyle shots and i wish i could keep the remote in my hand while moving and adjusting productanother side note i have a ti so when i use the remote to focus all it will do is focus on the middle of the screen
thats fine if your subject is in the middle of your shot but i found myself constantly moving the focus point and standing next to the camera to take a photo
having the aperture wide open made this very necessaryother than that this product does what it says press lightly to focus press firmly to snap a shot hold and slide the button to keep the shutter openthe canon remote switch rs e does what its supposed to you push the button and it trips the shutteri wish the cord was longer
also it doesnt work when the plug is pushed in all the way
i found that i had to pull it back out a bit or it wouldnt connectthis is not as bad as some accessories but still  for plastic is badit does the job and works fine
cord is too short for my liking  ymmvwell the first part of the title for this product is true  for this is a rip offit is the size of a bic lighter and about a well made for this it gets three stars max
i have not used it yet but even if it works  for this
i was forworned by other reviewers but i was to gun shy to make my own their are many post on the www on how to do it your self and save some coin you can put towards one of their  lenso this is another one of those situations where canon rips you offso it goes you need a cable release if you use a tripodps chicks are never free everit seemed to work well initially but recently when i reached for it it had stopped functioning
it opened it up to see if there was a battery i could replace but found nonei wonder if there is a way to make it work
other than that it appeared like a nice handy accompaniment to my camera bagnot exactly but close
i was hoping the remote would also work with video but it doesnt
the cord is very short also
works good for stillsthis product does exactly what it says it does
it works great and has no issues
i do recommend buying an intervalometer instead for the same price and having more featuresbought one of these for myself but passed it on to another palm m buyer
the case opens only one way  palm on the right slots for credit cards on the left
this makes the machine much bulkier to carry and more importantly awkward to use if you tend to approach the palm from left as well as righton the other hand the new owner is absolutely thrilled with the quality of the leather and fascinated by the use of velcro to attach the palm to the case
moreover she works her palm on flat surfaces where the extra leather to the left is less bothersome than my approach of holding the palm in midair
conclusion
try looking at this case open before you buy to be sure it suits your styleever wonder what its made of
plasticwhat you want is a product that improves your productivity
whats a piece of colored plastic gonna doits very cool but the color maybe be annoying after a while
youre gonna use your palm for hours but the bright colors may cause stress
it also doesnt match with business suits or uniforms
and people will comment on the color of your palm instead of what the palm actually does
i often walk into a room then i open my palm and then people are looking at it but are they looking because its colorful or its a palm or maybe they never seen one
sometimes they come up to me and ask about it  i pretend i dont understand them and speak with a foreign accent
the only problem is that i went to school with it tsss teens todaytry to write with a colorful pen
if you look at it sometimes then ask yourself if it bothers your concentration
then if it doesnt you know what you gotta doits also a productivity item in some ways
if colors motivate you then purchase iton the box it says thirty canadian bucks but some places are selling them for forty
are canadians nuts

this isnt  the only device to see this problem my kodak camera does too  but it seems to be fixed with the os version  that just  came out
 backlight really only useful when its dark out not just dim  no os out of the box so you have to hit the website before  you can play with it
this also means demo models in stores  often wont be functional except for the running demo
 the sound recorder program is still in development but is  supposed to be out this spring
 the microsoft reader program is also still in development  but is also supposed to be available very soon   included reader for nonfranklin format is crappy use  mobireaderoverall conclusiondepsite some problems ive been pretty happy with my  for the week ive had it
i wouldnt buy the  since for the price difference you can get a m ram upgrade for the  from sandisk over the internet
i wouldnt pay franklins ram prices since you can get the sandisk mmc cards for less than half of that
i would also buy some rechargable batteries for itwell the latest version of the ebookman operating system has arrived v  and  i still lose memory when i change batteries
this means you cant take the ebookman with you on a long weekend or vacation unless you also bring the pc you use to download new material
so far franklins idea of technical support is to have a technician call me sympathize explain that the battery problem is in the operating system and then offer no information when a new operating system will be available or when the problem will be fixed
what a painif your dvd is in perfect condition this player does a fine job
however if your disk has even the smallest fingerprint smudge or scratch forget it
this player can also be quite noisy with lots of noise from the drive and the laser mechanism as it tries to keep upi used a palm iii before getting a palm vii and really the only difference is te wireless capability
this is obviously the big selling point but it falls short of being what it promisesthe wireless services arent full fledge
its a quotclippingquot service meaning it only sends you small snipets of a web page
thus you dont get access to full text articles only summaries
i can actually get more information using avantgo with my old palm  the only down side is that its not quotreal timequot the way it is with the wireless palm viiyou have to pay a monthly fee for the wireless service called palmnet which gets you a base amount of bytes for free
if you use up those quotbytesquot then youre charged per byte after that
so if you read the nyt download stock quotes and check the weather every hour than its going to be quite expensive to use the wireless service
heavy users of email may also want to invest in the keyboard attachment for palms as wellwhat the wireless service is great for is checking movie times weather forecasts sending a quick text message etcthe palm is still an excellent example of simplicity providing value and youll find it incredibly easy to use
i think the wireless service is a glimpse of what is to come but this version isnt worth the price yetif you can afford thewireless and realize that this is not going to replace your desktop for web surfing the palm viix is a good way to stay connected
and it fits in your pocketlike the other  palms the viix does what it claims and never complainsthere are two  catches though wireless applications are a very limited version of  the net
theres no builtin web browser that lets you go to any old web  page
so unless you install rd party programs youre limited to the   bundled destinations amazon askjeeves cbs marketwatch fidelity 
surprisingly there was no builtin wireless phone book the wireless  connection is slow and expensive
the bandwidth is under  baud and  theres a  second delay between clicking and getting a responseif  youre an information junkie stock quotes news email ebayis this  you
you will easily blow through the limited wireless planson the plus side i was always able  to connect to the wireless net in buildings in a car in a park where  cell coverage is spotty the device always did what i expected  stars
id give it  if the wireless service was cheaper and  fasterpatthese things are really narrow about  of an inch
i thought they would be more robust but they were cheapbought  zips at home depot for  more and they were much stronger
they were physically thicker and the head was much largerthese are ok  not gb they are monoprice brand
thin but i think theyll work
its hard to say which plastic is best until its exposed to the sun for a while
i dont like receiving a different brand than what was advertisedthe ties are somewhat thin and tend to break easily
the price was good but im little disappointed with the reliabilitythese cable ties are ok  they do seem to break fairly easily especially when cold
however if using them inside or with limited cold exposure you should be finewhen i bought these they were cheaper than the ones sold in my local home improvement store but now they cost more
they are great zip ties and do everything i need them tojust watch the pricehi  i recently ordered this because it says the origin was usa but when i got it big lettersmade in chinaaaaaaaaaaaathey are liars this limited capability hybrid is an affordable toy
it blends the popular izone polaroid instant camera with a very basic digital camera
well it does neither task well and no one is going to come to love this thing once the initial cuteness wears off
as an izone a fun little camera that prints instant postage stamp photos from pretty expensive polaroidonly film its no longer way overpriced though the film will keep setting you back
as a digital camera its way underfeatured
it lacks a zoom an expandable memory a decent resolution its not good enough to print even  x s and most woefully a usb connection to download the few pics the onboard memory can handle
you may think thats no big deal but it makes getting those pics onto your computer a slow painful and batteryconsuming process
if you want an izone buy one if you want a basic digital camera look at amazons great collection or the ones ive reviewed
if youre looking for a bargain on christmas gifts this just might fit the billthe tamrac web site recommends the  case for the canon gseries so i bought it for my g
at the time i did not pay attention to the front pocket which can carry  aa batteries
the g does not use aa batteries so this pocket just takes extra space
i sometime use it to carry my blackberry curve and it makes the case much bulkier
also if one has a strap attached to the camera the cases strap is redundanttamrac has since developed a new case specifically for the gg model 
for those of you who prefer a tight and compact fit the  may be a better option however it does not have an extra opening for the other end of the camera strapi finally bought the canon psc case and it was a perfect fit
it allows one to carry the camera horizontally by the strap or via the belt sleeve and be able to pull the camera out quickly when neededoverall a nice bag
fits my canon g perfectly
i will be wearing it on my belt though its pretty bulkyfront to back distance is same as the length of the g
i have a retro looking leather case like those used for s and s rangefinder cameras that i will use when i want to wear the camera with a neck strapi marked down this case because its shape isnt smooth as in the pictures
i bought two of these both tops are a bit wavy and both the opening lips and tops edges are a bit deformed by the neck strap being hooked on the d rings but forced inside the cases
this is a little nitpicking and it will not bother most people probably
but i was not expecting it and most carrying cases i see in stores though not this model dont have this problem
and it wouldnt bother me as much if it were a cheap import from china but its not priced or marketed as one
also the slight curvedin lip again caused by the way the strap is packed of the top opening tends to catch on the hot shoe of the camera when i try to put the camera in
tamrac should just put the strap in the bag without attaching it to the d rings imoi do most of my buying on the internet but this is the kind of thing id rather buy in a local store where i can see the actual item im buying
im tempted to return both of these but i was able to straighten them out a little after warming them with a hair dryer and i havent seen this model or a similar design at the local storesthis is a nice wellmade durable backpackit just arrived today and i immediately stuffed it with my nikon d slr with an mm lens attached and  additional lenses
it was a very tight squeeze getting this little bit of gear into the backpack
the bag is bulging at the sides making it a bit of a pain to zip up
if i had it to do over i would probably opt for something larger than this backpack but for what it is and the price itll do
the good thing about it is that the space constraints can be somewhat alleviated by purchasing attachable lens cases such as the mx and mxi originally purchased the standard nikon bag which by the way holds nothing and quickly found out that i needed something a bit larger and could carry more than just the camera
while i was a little disappointed with the bag at first i think it is just what i need at this point in photog life
the picture from the manufacturer is a bit misleading
bottom line it wont hold a lot of stuff but thats not to say its too small
here is a list of my pros and conspros scalability
the mas
and sas
attachments are where this bag excels at
while it wont hold everything at first it can definitely grow as you collection does
rain flap
this flap is not as cumbersome as some would have you believe
it can get in the way but that is why we have two hands and opposing thumbsjust move it over
configurable inside and out
you can move the dividers around to suit your needs and there are more straps on the outside to attach things than carter has peanuts
well cushioned which means your prized possessions are in good hands
well constructed
stitching is great and no signs of it going to wear out in the forseeable futurecons the pockets in the front flap are almost laughable
they wont hold much but thats not to say they cant hold what they were intended to pen cleaner maybe a notepad extra batteries a usb cable and some memory cards
super long shoulder straps
i have no idea who is expected to carry this thing but the straps could have been a bit shorter
btw they do adjustim just griping
all in all this is a good little bag that can grow as your collection does and is perfect for the photog that needs more than just a camera bagworks great for my nikon
i have two extra lenses a lensbaby muse and a macro lens
they all fit snug along with the external sb  flsh
i cannot imagine a telephoto lens fitting in the bag
this bag was brand new so i am sure it has to get worn in a bit but very durable and many places to fit accesories
i am glad i have this bag because everything i need will fit in herei really liked this bag when i first got it  it was exactly what i wanted a small backpack that i could carry my camera with its  lense and my extra  zoom lense as well as my cameras batteries and battery charger and extra dodads like memory chips and the likeand then i went on vacation and put the bag to the testwhat i determined was this even for such a small bag it was heavy with all my gear in it and ended up hurting my shoulders
i also found it really annoying that every time i wanted to put my camera away or take it out or switch lenses or get at anything else i had to take the bag off put the camera and bag down somewhere and switch everything around
it ended up being a big ordeal and not as easy as i wantedoverall though the bag is well made feels pretty heavy duty and has lots of good pockets and places to stuff things away
i did find the zippers to be a little sticky and hard to pull due to the heavy fabric flap covering it it seems like the flap was sewn down too tightlyi would have given this bag four stars except for the zipper issue and the fact that it didnt end up suiting my needsi bought this backpack for my new olympus e flash and three lenses mm mm and mm
it hardly holds just the camera and the mm and flash leaving no room for the other two lenses
i have jammed my other supplies such as lens cleaning kit filter kit battery charger etc
and i can hardly close the thing
i bought this style because i liked the way the interior is designed i just think i bought the wrong size for my needs
am going to try and return it and buy the larger version
other than the above the backpack is well put together with strong materials
it is small and light weight without any gear so would be better fit for a smaller slr with one or two small lensesi got this bag and it is small
i can fit my e  with one lens attached one extra lens battery charger usb cable extra battery lens hood and everthing is full and its tight
secondly on the back it is a small bag than a regular bagpack
when you have to take it out you will have difficulty but if you want to change the lens also you will need a place to put it cannot do it standing or need a help
a normal  inch tripod will hang on the back but it will be hanginggiven a choice i would not buy it againi have a rebel xt    and the  is lenses
this bag claims this should all fit
i didnt mention that i have lens hoods for the  and the  i can fit the camera and lenses but as soon as you add a flash exii  excellent flash or the lens hoods it goes from unnnghtight to a pool of extra items sitting on the floor that wont fit
its a cute little backpack assuming you arent serious even halfway serious about photography
if all you have is a kit lens and a  you might be ok but any more go for something larger
seriouslytamrac is a great company
this bag is well constructed visibly durable and nicely designed but it just isnt a good size
if you really do hope to fit in two dslrs with lenses attached of normal length youll be disappointed to find out theres hardly any room left to fit a long lens or a even two normal lenses
its just too cramped
although the pockets on the top front and sides of the bag are great and fit lots of things the main compartment is too small to fit two cameras and lenses comfortably
im returning mine and upgrading to the pro  which is a perfect size for two bodies and  or  lenses and a flashi looked long and hard before deciding on the tamrac pro   i received my bag a little over a month ago and until last night i was pretty much satisfied with itthe division system is a bit hard to get used to but you can rearrange it since the walls are velcro
it is important to point out that with the default configuration you will be stacking lenses
the lenses on the bottom row will be covered with a velcro pad and not easily accessible
i will point out that after coming to a setup i could work with i had a nice amount of velcro debris in the bottom that i ended up vacuuming out you will want to do the same so those buggers cant make it into your geari mentioned i was more or less satisfied until last night
a trident on one of the quick snap buckles broke off
im more careful than most with my gear so if the bag is already breaking down with light use im a bit worried about the long term implications here
tamrac has a  year warranty on their bags but the caveat is you must pay shipping each way and they quote at least a two week turn around
there are plenty of other snaps so ill hold off on getting it serviced for now
it is nice to know that if it degrades any further i can have it repaired or replaced for the cost of shipping both wayslike everyone else i did all the research and read the reviews
i wanted this style bag not a sling or a backpack or a holster just a traditional shoulder bag that could hold two rebel xts with the normal  lens attached
so it came down to the kata ws the kata sb the lowepro magnum aw the tamrac  and the tamrac   dimensions were all within  and prices on amazon varied from  for the tamrac  to  for the loweproso i decided to try the smallest of the group  the tamrac  and it will not confortably hold  rebel xts with their  lenses attached one has a lens hood
the front of the lenses will bump each other in the middle of the case
and it would have been very difficult to arrange and access all of my other stuf with the two cameras taking up so much of the top area of the caseaside from that it appeared to be a strong well made bag so i opted to spend another  and go for the tamrac  and im damn glad i did
camera lenses dont bump enough space for all my stuf and easy access to everything
check out my review under that product for more detailsi had a very old  tamrac bag and needed a new one for  cameras so i chose this one based on the online description onlylike many pockets size appropriate for most camerasdislike the quality of the  model is very far below the  model
especially disppointing the zippers that feel cheap and fragile the lowerlevel pockets are not easily accessible
from the picture i thought the lowerlevel pockets were accessible from the front of the bag but actually you need to remove the cameras from the top compartments and open up the velcrosealed lowerlevel pocket covers not very convenientthis is a nice camera bag and has a great deal of storage capabilities
you have the ability to store many things and it easily customized to accommodate a diverse array of lenscamera body collections
this is an undeniable fact but is it a socalled pro bag
i sure doesnt seem like it to mefirst of all it simply isnt convenient and in the field can be frustratingly difficult to get gear out in a hurry
for instance the shoulder straps interfere when you try to remove the locks that allow the top flap to be opened
using only the front straps seem like it would be a good option but not if you have any weight in the bagwhile the bag is probably great for dx bodies and kit lenses if fails when it comes to the larger fx bodies and professional level lenses
i use a d and a de for my work and i require my mm fg mm fg and a combination of either mm fg  mm fg or  fg or mm fg micro and unfortunately i cannot fit my entire combo in the bag at the same time
i work around this by keeping one of the bodies and lens out of the bag and only use the bag for lens changes and for other gear items
not perfect but a workable situation for sureeven though the bag does not hold nearly as much gear as i hoped nor does it allow the ease of access i had hoped it would it does a good job of keeping a huge amount of nonlenscamera items well organized and are all somewhat easily accessedif i wasnt so busy and really needed a bag for my work i probably would have sent this back and tried another option
however the time has passed and im trying to figure out a work around that will allow me to get the most out of this bagi intended to use this bag for a d dslr a   and  lens with hoods plus a ex flash and a small assortment of accessories
simply not enough space in this bag for these items
im returning the bag and ill shop for one slightly larger
if you carry fewer items this might be the right bag for youthe nomad juke box is by no means the perfect solution to mass storage of mps on a mobile unitthe downsides battery life its only four hours
so you can store hundreds of hours of music on the thing but only listen to four hours between charges kind of lame
the good thing is that creative does include two sets of rechargeable batteries
that makes up for the low battery life size this thing is heavy
it is as creative says the quotsize of a cd playerquot the size yes but not the weight
if youre thinking about going jogging or even walking really with this thing go buy something else
it s just too big the hard drive deal how creative could have stored  gigs on a portable player without a hard drive i dont know but the hard drive just doesnt work that well
therere the vibrations the heat it can get really hot copying stuff to it and the possibility of damage
i havent dropped the thing yet but i imagine that if i did it would not be goodthe upsides the space of course lots of music  the organization software is pretty decent i hate the soundjam software for mac thoughso in summary if you just need to have all your mps with you this thing is great as long as you can deal with the battery recharging
if youre looking to just play some mps on a jog run or in the car go get a rio or a nomad if you like creativetheyre both finewhile the media trumpets the triumph of the first mass storage mp player thier a little off the mark
the pjb a research project by compaq liscensed to hango of korea and marketed by remote solutions here in the states was the first true full function mass produced unitthe nomad beats it on price  its quotcuterquot looking depending on ones point of viewthe pj cleans the nomads clock when it comes to play time
 hrs versus nomads  these are real world numbers not manufacturer hype
the pj uses one large li battery as opposed to the  quotaaquot in the nomad
recharge time on the pj with its built in circuitry is on the order of  hrs
additional batteries are about  a pop
so it takes  batteries to equal the power of the pj
at  a set itll give you minutes of play time on anything other than nimh  for an external charger youve dropped another   plus time to charge
and dragging around those extra batteriessize wise the comparision of the nomad to a cd player is very accurate
so if you dont mind carrying that around great
the pj is about the size of   packs of cigarettes side to side
slips easily into the front pocket of ones jeans although it comes with a nice case that clips to ones belt
both units are well constructed personal experience has shown the pj to survive desk to floor plummets without a scratchbeyond that theyre pretty much apples to apples in comparision
both sport  gig drives
both carry good warrenties and excellent support
the nomad sports dsp effects i prefer to listen to the music as the artist had intended and has recording capability where youd use this is beyond me thoughthe pj doesnt have a backlite display but has a  line display versus the  on the nomadboth use usb interfacing and have about the same load rate
the pjs software package allows for ripping cds only direct to the unit without the option of saving on your pcs drive
you can load existing mps onto the unit thoughthe nomad will supposedly support useage as a removable stroage unit for other files types
the same benefit can be had with a zip disk or cd writersthe nomad will supposedly support future hard drive size increases
the pj is quotstockquot at  gigs although there is an unoffical upgrade path to  gigsalthough a little bit more the pj edges out the nomad in my opinion which is why i now own  unitsyou can transfer mp files into the nomad jukebox but not out of the jukebox
you can however delete them
why this decision was made is hard to understand but if youre thinking you can for example transfer mp files from your work computer to the nomad then take it home and transfer them on to your home computer think again the transfer is one way onlyive had a  gig nomad jukebox for about a year now
its been a lovehate relationship
the battery life is abysmalthe first unit i got from amazon wouldnt hold a charge long enough to boot the machine up and the one that amazon sent to replace it is only marginally better
think of the nomad as only quasiportable because battery life really sucks the problem is compounded by the units boottime battery life check
it will often fail this test when there is plenty of juice in the box
the supplied playcenter software stuttered and faltered on windows  making it tricky to download more than a few files at a time
and the creative website was amazingly little helpthey seem to have no clue on making playcenter useful to people
the ui of the player itself is quirky and gets sluggish when you start to fill up the hard disk but i cant really complain about itbut having said that the unit works well once you get your tunes in there and dont stray far from a power outlet
i keep it by my desk and hardly ever touch a cd anymorethere are people like myself who would deem a product like this a necessity rather than a luxury
i needed a place to store and backup my mps
the nomad jukebox can store mps like nothing else to date almost  gigs of spacethe problem is it cannot backup anything
once an mp is uploaded to the jukebox it cannot be downloaded
is this flaw problematic enough to return this otherwise evolutionary product and wait for something that can both upload and download mps
it was for memy friend recommended the nomad  gb jukebox and the i was bought by the great reviews on amazon and cnetcom
the rechargable batteries that come with the jukebox drain in less than a few hours
i returned my first nomad because i thought the battery drainage was not normal
my new nomad still requires frequent battery charges
the large pricetag and the quick battery drains warrants a  stars rankaside from the quick battery drains the nomad jukebox is a great piece of technology
if large storage space and superior antishock are your main concerns go for the nomad jukebox
if you want mobile music go for a more batteryefficient mp playerhave had this lens about  days
i have extensively tested it out
this is a well made lens with a nice feel to it
it has a wonderful review on photozone and by reviewers on amazon
it takes excellent pictures on both crop  full frame camera bodieshowever i found close focusing macro photography  literally impossible unless a tripod was used
a monopod improved focusing but it was still not tack sharp
i found the mm focal length actually mm on a  ti crop body to be difficult to hold steady without a monopod
the autofocus also gave me a lot of problems indoors
the lens focusing just seems to jam in low light situations
it gets stuck and the only way to release it is to point it long distance
this has happened on several occasions and really is very annoyinglike i said before this lens has great reviews on photozone and other professional photographic sites but it is just not working for me
my ef  f is lens  is slightly heavier but it took better indoor and outdoor pictures than this ef mm macro  i could not believe it when i compared the pictureswill test it out a little longer for macro purposes
if things do not improve i will be returning it to amazon as being defective due to autofocus jamming
just a real diappointment
it is possible that mine might be just a bad copy or maybe the autofocus technology is still lagging in this area of photographyupdate    after nearly  weeks of using this lens i decided to return it as i just could not tolerate the jamming on autofocus and lack of isit is however a well built and excellent lens for those who love spending hours doing macro work with a tripod and manual focusing
autofocus however needs to vastly be improved in this area of photographyi gave it a  because i find autofocus for macro shooting useless
i also find the fmm focal lens mm on  crop frame body very difficult to hold steady without isthis is a mediocre portrait lens and a not so easy to use macro
would get the is versionhalf of the pictures i took were out of focusthis lens is a nice tele for beginners
it takes fairly crisp images with proper light
there is no stabilization so low light situations even evenings or shaded areas will require a tripod
the lens is quite heavy but that is to be expected
the build quality is a tad suspect
there is actually several small specs of dust on the inside of the lensi bought this lens along with a mm zoom to get a wide coverage of focal lengths for as little money as possible
at the same time i wanted to maximize my sharpness at mm for bird and astronomy photography
if this is your goal then this is the perfect lens
it is significantly sharper than the mm lens at mm while still staying under 
if saving money is your absolute priority then go with the mmin the end i have become dissatisfied with the sharpness at mm
as stated in other reviews it really drops off after about mm
at full zoom i am finding the softness intruding on my pictures so i have started using it only as a mm zoomer
the x crop on my canon d makes up for this somewhat but its still a bit of a letdownanother aspect of this lens that i have found aggrivating is the tendancy for the lens to zoomunzoom itself if mounted vertically
the weight of the forward elements is suffient to actuate the zooming mechanism
sometimes this happens quickly and noticeably but ive had longexosure shots where the lens has slowly zoomed out during the exposure and ruined it weird effect but not what i was after
astrophotography in particular tends to see frequent use of the lens in a vertical position and this lens is really not the right choice if youre going to be aiming upthis is my third lens i already have the amazing f mm and the truely great mm is
comparing this lens to the  is this lens is very slow to focus has difficulty focusing in low light and the photos it takes are not nearly as sharp
on the other hand its a mm lens  itll take you quite close to a subject and the is means that you can handhold it in reletively decent light
two big drawbacks  the is doesnt work on tripod and it doesnt have a quotrealquot usm motor so you cant mix af and mf modes you have to choose between modes with a switch
if i had to do it over again id probably still get this lens since the next level up  is is four times more expensive and even the  is twice as expensive
if you intend to handhold shots the is is probably worth it over the nonis versioni shot a roll of a film with a newly purchased  is and returned it shortly afterwards
i was satisfied with the image quality although it could be sharper at the mm end however i found the performance of the lens to be unacceptable
the focusing speed is way too slow
for those of you who dont already know there are two kinds of usm motors
one of them is very fast and allows focus override one of them is very slow and does not allow for focus override
this lens has the latter
this lens flaunts the fact that it has a usm motor but believe me in terms of focusing speed you will not be able to detect any difference between this lens and the nonusm  lens
the fact that the lens is a slow dark f at mm doesnt help things either
the image stabilizer does work well but the focusing motor is just too slow
this is the first lens canon made with is and therefore contains the older usm motor as far as i know none of the other is lenses contain this type of motor
canon should really update this lens and put a better focusing motor in it
if they were to do that this would be a killer lensduring the event i shot using the  is usm i lost many good shots because the lens kept hunting instead of locking onto my subject
at one point i actually ended up throwing it into manual focus because it was just easier that way
unfortunately if you want a long telephoto zoom that focuses quickly you have to throw out a lot more money and buy something like the  is usm which contains the good usm motor or the  usm also containing the good focusing motorill close by saying that this lens will probably work well for you if you know youll always be shooting places where there is very sufficient light aka outside
otherwise id stay away from this lensto me the lens is okay
i do not love it
i use it for some sport action shots
it is something about the focusing that seems off
plus when it is focusing the noise is distractingthe trick with wk is to not use the bidirection utility
get the wk driver from the mfr website and install that
ignore the manuals statements obut ipxspx it works fine on only tcpip
after setting the devices ip address with the tcpip utility add your local printer and select the port that that you set up
the documentation was terrible but the unit functions very welli can verify what others have said here the linksys etherfast integrated ultrafast bit pc card  also known as model pcm v works well once installed but there can be major problems with installing the associated driver and technical support was not satifactory
the linksys pcm  wont work without the driver
the driver problemlinksys includes a floppy disk the one that goes into your a drive that is supposed to automatically install the driver
this worked fine on the first laptop computer i worked on operating system windows  but the disk would not work on a second laptop oswindows 
according to the included installation manual it should work with both windows  and  when i inserted the disk on the second computer all i got was a whirring sound and periodic noisesnothing was ever installedtech supportwhen calling sbc yahoo to make sure that this was not a compatibility problem actually in an earlier call to sbc they recommended the pcm they helpfully recommended that i call linksys tech supportunfortunately the linksys tech
support person seemed impatient and did not explain things clearly
she had me go through the floppy method  or  times after i had already explained that it didnt work
this was a waste of time tension was high
i can only hope that other tech support personnel have better trainingthe solutioni finally asked if there was some other way to install the driver without the obviously malfunctioning floppy
after being put on hold she returned and told me i could download the driver for free from the following websitethe download is easy
you select the product you want to download driver for pcm integrated and your operating system
i recommend downloading to your c drive it was easier for me to find it later
after downloading it i plugged the pcm  back into the laptop and when the installer instructions asked if it should look for the driver or if i wanted to tell it where to go i chose the latter and typed in the c drive as the location c
finally it worked and in the few days ive been trying out dsl ive had no problems with the product so farsummary and recommendationthe product itself works well but driver installation is buggy and at least in my one experience although others here have complained as well tech
support was inefficient and not consumerfriendly
later it occurred to me why wasnt i told sooner that i could simply download the driver
and what if i did not have a working dialup internet connectionwould i have had to wait for them to mail me another floppy
in contrast to the helpful and knowledgeable tech
support at sbc yahoo this was not a good experience
it would be best if you have a friend nearby who has changed from dialup to dsl to help you with installation or who can recommend a different companys product
and remember the url for the free linksys download   hopefully competition will increase in the future and buyers can choose a more reliable productthese speakers look sharp especially alongside a black flatscreen monitor
connecting the speakers is a breeze and only takes a couple of minutesthe sound is average and at least part of this can be attributed to the  drivers on the satellites being pointed down at the desk instead of out towards the listener
the satellites distort fairly easily as volume increases and they dont deliver much in the way of midrange
the bass is clean and strong at lowtomedium volume levels but the subwoofer struggles occasionally at higher volume and lower frequencies
these speakers do not fare well with classical or jazz but will suit most poprock listeners just finepeople claim to be audiophiles but the term is overused and usually not warranted
if you want to know how any speakers sound listen for yourself either in a store or preferably your room
if they sound good to you then great
if they dont then find something else and dont rely on the opinions of five reviewers when trying to choose the right speakersi had these atps but their tinny sound and lack of midrange led me to other speaker manufacturers
i ended up obtaining the klipsch promedia  speakers
while they are dramatically more expensive their sound is unparalleled for a  setup
if money is no object go with klipsch
otherwise the altec atps do an adequate job of filling a small room with decent sound at a reasonable pricealtec lansing in my opinion does not make very good speakers even though they are probably the longest lasting computer speaker manufacter
in many of their surround systems like their  and  systems they dont have many options and sound quality is crummy
the same goes for this rather stylish  system
these cost as much as the acs s which are  systems but they sound much betterbeing an audiophile i would not choose these speakers over a set of  yamahas or klipsch pro medias but if you have a tight budget and this is the best u can pack then by all means this might be your only choicethese flat panels are rather stylish but it does not mean that they have good quality
i found the bass either overpowering the weak satelites or i could barely hear the bass at allbecause these speakers do not have surround sound i do not recommend these speakers for gaming or dvd playing
dvds should use a system like klipsch pro media or any yamaha  system
same goes for games
this is mainly a budget music speaker system
not many people exactly want a speaker system for music that you can hear all of the different channels
although it would be nice its not what speakers focused on music is made forthese speakers are supposed to crank loud
they dont
they come almost to par with audio volume
i have to compliment lansing though because this model happens to be one of the best sounding speaker systems that will not get all distorted at midlevel soundif you crank these speakers they will kill you with all of the staticall in all i do not recommend these speakers unless you are on a tight budget and only want to listen to your mp collection without static at low volume levels
just be forwarned that these are not surround speakers meaning dvd and gaming is out of the question and they do not crank loud
if you crank them they will be distorted
i have to award them with  stars because they are a sleek stylish and affordable speaker system
but remember you  get what you pay forgreat product works ok it is pretty similar to the planet wave cables thats my opinion
buy one you wont be dissapointedand the title of the review pretty much says it alli actually think the standard wire i was using before was more easily hidden as this wire really is quite largethis wire is barely thinner than the  gauge wires i bought for a fraction of the price from monoprice  vs 
the speaker wires themselves are good quality and may work better under padded carpet as the bump will be spread across and less noticeable
unfortunately i bought these to run along the wall and its far too thick for that
youre better off going with a flat selfadhesive speaker wire if your intention is have it flat against the wall
however those cables are significantly more expensivehowever i give only  stars for value
for what this unit does it should cost  at the most
i have one which i found new for  and use it as a power center for powering up my home theater in sequence
it has a  volt tigger that works well with the tigger output from my outlaw audio prepro
it does a nominal job at cleaning up the power  the power stages of your components unless they were made before  should do more than an adequate job of cleaning the signal so that should never be the selling point of one of these unitsthis is a decent line conditioner
it filters out a lot of noise from my power including all of my appliances
the one thing it cant seem to filter out completely however is the dimmers on the torchier lamps
i can always hear when one of those darn things is on
otherwise its a decent unitplenty of good reviews here so i will not go into details on the product itself the only bad side of this product is that once it does its job its garbage i have now switched to panamax products for the one reason that they are usable after the product does its job and save all your equipment and if for some reason it does burn out they have a lifetime guaranty so in my humble opinion they are worth the extra cost and they are made in usa got to love thati own an iomega zip  drive and i used it for about a weeki thought it would be great to backup web sites and to transfer files between my computers at home but then i just found it easier to spend the money on a  port networking hub and a good cd writerzip drives are nowhere near as dependable as a cdr or rw and cds cost less money plus cds hold more informationi work at a printing company and do a lot of freelance web work so i get a lot of different types of media and i have to say that if everyone just bought a cd writer it would make life a lot easieri have been an avid pda user for some time and until recently used a palm v and palm m exclusively
after using a visor for two months i plan to continue using palms exclusivelymy reasonsfirst the visor is significantly larger than the palm v and even the palm m
as a result it is difficult to carry your visor with you without having a bag or a very large jacket pocket
trying to fit the visor into a pair of jeans is impossiblesecond the styling isnt nearly as inspired as that on the palms
the design is more square i realize the palm iiis and the viis are square too but im comparing to the v and the m than palms the buttons harder to push and the power button harder to usethird the expansion slot really isnt all its cut out to be
for me a pda is a pdaa replacement for my address book calendar to do list and note pad
it is not an mp player an camera a gps locater etcespecially if the additional functions never work as well as the quotreal thingquotplease buy a palm
theyre fantastici really wanted to wait before upgrading from vdx but since my vdx was acting strangely and i wanted the visorphone tooi bit the bulletim moderately satisfied but unenthusiasticpros  bright screen looks great indoors
nicer looking than vdxcons  color quality is soso
screen is barely readable outside or in any bright light
huge problem
i knew i would hate the lithium battery
i dobugs  i did my first sync to my home computer to lotus organizer
just as happened when i first bought a vdx it asked me on installation if i wanted to keep my lotus conduits
i said yes
it overwrote them all anyway necessitating a reinstall of easy sync
not such a big deal but annoying
more dangerous none of my notepad entries syncd and they were all wiped out
yes i had them backed up
wonder how many people wont
most of my calendar entries were wiped out too
not to mention a couple of hundred address book entries when my data was quotrestoredquot from backup foldersyikesmore bugs but not nec handsprings fault  i love jot one of the most useful addon programs
it does cause some conflicts with programs that required pen input to perform a function like bdicty translation and avantgo when using form submissionswith the upgrade to visor prism though the conflicts were more frequent
city datetime albums to go eyemodule and most anything that had graphical features caused fatal errors
i had to do two hard resets in the first  hours before i figured out that jot was causing the problems
and thank god for the backup modulesconclusion  on the whole my biggest complaint is the  visibility of the screen outdoors
i think the cons outweigh the advantages here
i had to buy
if i didnt i would note that is only a modest upgrade for a far higher price from vdx
i would have preferred to wait
if you cansee whats better next year
if you cant its a reasonably good product that is however overhypedfor less than  digicam this thing is awesome
i used amd k mhz mb ram usb connection for the cam and win  and it works really nice
but somehow you need to download the updates from their website jamonlinecom
the ccd is not very good you can see quite much color noisemy biggest complain is the cam use the battery power to transfer pictures and not the power from usb
as a result the battery needs to be replaced  too often less than  shotsdont think to use the x res as the x res is not excellent
what i do is take the pic using x and resize the image using photoshop to x
do a little trick and youll get a decent pic not very wellthe best part the memory is expandable to whatever you can afford using mmc usb connection win  support builtin flash durable body and not too expensivefor best result use accu rechargable battery instead of regular v or alkaline
believe me i spent  regular v the square one for less than  shots only  are decent
bring extra battery when travelling and transfering imagefor expandibility get sandisk mmc not viking
i got my self a viking mmc and doesnt work
read my review in viking mmc mbrecommended for children and very light userthis camera would be great for kids
its easy to use and does pretty much what it is described to do
for this price though dont expect miracles
im afraid youll have to pay much much more for a good digital camerai waited a long time to write this review ive had the camera for about  months now
first let me mention the serious problems this camera hasjamcam error with windows xp
as the others stated they were having problems with win and drivers winxp renders this camera almost useless
i have downloaded the drivers for winxp from the jamonline website and installed them perfectly still have serious problems just extracting the images via usb to my computer
after installing the xp drivers i was able to make  download set of pictures from jamcam twain source
after that i get an error
if you reinstall the drivers over same error
you must uninstall the drivers from the device manager not the uninstall program while the camera is connected otherwise it will not appear in the device list
then run the driver update which tells you it is uninstalling again then run the xp driver update a third time
then you can download one set of pictures and start all over again
this is very timeconsumingalso i dont know whether the camera is broken or it is windows xp but i am now losing several images with every download
if i take  pictures i may only get  back
i dont know where they go theyre simply not on the thumbnail bar
i have not checked to see if this happens on win or me so hopefully its windows xp
the only other workaround to the problem with xp usb drivers is to use the included serial cable com port the transfer rate is very slow on this also
the pictures take about  seconds each to load via serial connection
but it works however i still lose photos with this methodthe camera is slow
it takes about  seconds for the camera to think before its ready to take another shot and a bit longer if you need the flash
it is also definitely not a fastmotion camera you have to keep the camera steady and tell people to freeze or they will blur up badlythe camera is easily fooled into thinking the subject is well lit by ambient light avoid taking photos with a window in the background or light sourceit is possible to take decent pictures with this camera for a  x  camera the images are pretty decent most often
the flash does a good job but you will end up overexposing if you take pictures with a flash close upinternal memory is insufficient
you can take  pictures at hires with internal memory
dont even bother using the lower r setting to save space
you can pick up a cheap    mb mmc card along with the camera
mmc card memory prices keep getting lower
sandisk is the most popular but a little expensive i bought a delkin devices mb mmc for around 
dont believe the other review stating that mmc cards lose their memory they dont
but as i stated earlier i do lose photos for unknown reasonsbattery eater
this is no surprise all digital cameras eat batteries
it uses v batteries
get a nimh recharger andor a cheap universal wall outlet battery adapter with v connector to power it while transferring images to your pcnow for the positivefor the price this camera is definitely worth it
i suggest using another web site to compare prices there was a  rebate but i think that has since expired and i never got minebottom linethis is a great kids camera but also a capable camera for snapping photos for email etc
however x leaves a lot to be desired and i am going to move on to a  megapixel now because prices are lower now
if you do use it be sure to get extra memory and take  photos of whatever scenes you dont want to lose
a mb mmc card will give you space for  photos on the camera so you can snap away in  second intervals do not buy this camera if you use xpdo do some research for the cheapest price on the webi will update this review if i figure out anything on the winxp and lost photos problemwhat can i say
by the time you develop a disposable camera and get the film printed it costs nearly as much as a jamcam
i bought my jamcam to keep in my desk at work and snag the occasional sunset or broken fire hydrant with
its great for cheap snapshots
it comes with software that works acceptably
the usb interface is not the fastest ive encountered but it eventually transfers photos
i havent tried a memory card with it yet but might in the future
im glad i got mine
it was worth every penny of what i paid and i dont have to worry about wasted packaging or toxic chemicals going into the environment
i just transfer my photos to my computer and email them to friendsuse the search to check for the blue version of the jamcam  there is a link to drivers for xp and  and others therequick summary decent st camera if you can stand x
an mmc card is not needed but makes the camera much more useful
you cant use an mmc reader to read this card only the camera
the flash is too powerful at close rangestop by the blue versions reviews for lots moreive owned mine for over a year amp have been impressed with it in several ways
first is the new lowered price real digital cameras at such a nice price are quite a development
the applications this camera seems best suited to are emailing photos webpage posting or limited photo printing quot x quot max as in school papers or nonprofessional grade work reports
the resolution is up to these tasks but not much more
it has no zoom lens which limits its usefulness
it does have a good indoor flash and it has an expandable memory multimediacards generally harder to find amp a bit higher cost than other memory formats
the camera will download into the pc via usb forget about painfully slow serial port options but the only way to fly is to use a separate mmc card reader a little more  but no battery use and much better speed
all in all this is a great camera for younger students and beginners whose main interest is computerbased digital photographyi was looking for an inexpensive digital camera for posting to web based auctions
well this is about as inexpensive as it gets
yes the oem battery wont last a day but the good one i bought has lasted for  dozen pictures and downloads and is still going
if youre looking for something to use like a real camera buy something else
if you want to email pictures to friends or post pictures on an auction site this camera will work until you want to spend enough money for a real digital camerafor a sufficiently low price this is a pretty decent x camera especially with a cheap mmc card added
with the driver updates listed in other reviews it works tolerably with winxp as well though its much smoother going with winse
the flash works tolerably well at night though its rather overpowering if youre too close to the subject
its twain driver is also annoying as it apparently gives no way to download raw images all are preprocessed before downloadone suggestion made in another review though is completely offtrack an mmc card reader cannot be used with this camera
has the reviewer who suggested it ever actually used this camera
photos are saved to the card in an annoying proprietary format which means that it cannot be read other than with the camera
id strongly suggest use of a v battery eliminator for downloading or youll find yourself going through batteries at quite a clipanother shopping site also states clearly that mmc cards m in size do not work properly with this camera
theres a lot of misinformation present about this camera in the reviews and links here  caveat emptorim sure anyone with little cash and wanting okay headphones will be plenty satisfied with these but if you are looking for some real cans your going to have to take a jump into the s
anyways for anyone with some cash to spend and wants a pair of over the head headphones that are durable comfortable and with okay sound then the sony mdr is your set of headphonesthese headphone though by no means audiophile grade are overall a good buy
comfortwise these automatically contour ergonomically to even the largest of noggins
they gently press against your ear with plush cool padding  unlike many headphones i can wear these for hours without a hint of pain
in this respect theyre superior to  studio reference headphones ive used
soundwise they are merely what youd expect for the money though they do mute loud music quite well  handy for the public computer labs and road trips
if youre going to use headphones on a really regular basis id recommend spending a bit more but theyre fine for casual listeners and great for the money the nbl is ridiculously high priced but you will definitely want to buy one if you do any amount of photography with your digital elph swhen intuition fails there is no manual to fall back on
the included cd contains adequate instructions as long as you are working within sight of your desk top computer
i have however found casio customer service assistance by phone to be very good and available in a reasonable amount of timei responded to an offer for a  rebate for the casio if i subscribed to audiblecom services for a year
when combined with casios inadequate instructions the inclusion of audiblecom into the picture results in a process not unlike playing dungeons and dragons
for instance downloads from audiblecom to the microsoft reader included in the e cannot be deleted by simply clicking the ms readers delete function
you must go through an arcane deletion process using audibles socalled manager software
otherwise you must do a quothard resetquot which wipes out all the casios ram including settingsi love the casio e even with its lack of instructions but feel that the  audible rebate does not even come close to compensating for the labor puzzlement frustration and downright disgust involved in using their socalled servicei used to have an e which was the immediate predecessor and after almost two years of happy use of it i have to admit it worked beautifully for me until one day i could no longer get it to charge the batteryi tried buying a new battery but nothing it was something insideso i decided to call casio to see what they could do for me
either their customer service is terrible in general or they just didnt care about old windows cebased cassiopeia e users now that they had released their new line of pocket pcpowered pdasthe fact was that after looking for a painfully long time for repair center information i was finally able to talk to a person in order to find out about what would it entail to repair my pda
she said to me that it would cost me 
i asked her why if they didnt even know what the problem wasapparently thats the standard charge for repairing anything with them which as you may realize is a mjor turndown
i told myself quotfor  i can get myself one of those palmbased pdasquot
so i did and i ended up selling it because its not even half as good as windowspowered pdasbut i will not buy any more casio pdas until i hear a very good story about their service
for now i will get myself a compaq ipaci bought this intending to replace my palm v organizer and save me from buying a mp player
sadly i am returning it to amazoncom whose return policy is great by the wayi am going to make my statements in categories so that everyone can follow them more easily hardware excellent design and button layout scrolling wheel was well placed and very useful
i liked that the power and menu buttons fall right under my thumb it allowed for a very natural feel and easy operation
screen is very vibrant and pictures look great on it
the touchscreen aspect is very responsive and one can even imagine a tactile click when you tap it
size
a little clunky as far as demensions but its hardware features make up for that
one thing that makes it larger is the ability to swap out the liion battery you can get an external charger and spare battery from casio so the unit is larger to allow for this ability
speed
the unit itself includes a mhz processor so it is definately fast
the syncronization on the other hand seemed to be very slow  even with the usb cradle
it took  minutes to load one four minute mp if you are going to do a lot of mp stuff get a cf card reader and an additional card to transfer them with
now my major complaint and the thing that was enough to make me not keep this device
the software
it was fast but nearimpossible to close running programs
it came with btask but it is an annoying little window that floats around on the screen
the casio menu screen is abnoxious compared to just using the start menu
the activesync  software that came with the unit kept quotloosingquot my device and not being able to find it again until i restarted my computerif the software were better it would get  stars and id be keeping it
but i just cant get past how difficult the software is
it is very powerful but i like the useability of my palm v more than i like the quotcoolnessquot and difficulty of the ethis dvd player is a great entry level dvd player
it has all the stardard dvd features widescreen fast  forwardrewind slow forward play loop dolby stero d sound s video output digital stero output and regular  analog stero output and supports all the stuff you find dvds subtitles extras and such
the great thing about  this dvd player are two fold simple to use and it can keep up with the action
as strange as it sounds some dvd  players can not decode the information off a dvd fast enough when the action is fast on the screen
the result is  skipping and jumping
well with this player that does not occur
all action all the time is smoothoverall though i though this machine was not that great i mean it is not asthetically pleasing in the first place and ok it does skip and jump at times and the special features you could find on any midentry player oh and toshiba is known for selling bad hardwarei just read an article in electronic trader weekly forget about it dont get iti purchased this dvd player based on the quality of toshibas dvd mechanism
the player plays dvdrom and cdrom discs very well
quality is present and performance is nearly flawless
if these are the only requirements you have this unit is an excellent choicebut there are problems
i had hoped to be able to play my own cdr recordings
no dice
toshiba includes a disclaimer in the manual about pirated recordings and their choice not to support recordable discs at least in this model
so if you are creating legitimate recordings you are still out of luck
another problem in my opinion is the warranty
one year on parts  days on labor
sorry but if theres a problem i expect it to be corrected at no charge under warranty including labor
i am afraid this may be my last toshiba purchasei bought both the targus stowaway and the hp pocket keyboard for the hp jornada  what did i end up using all the time
the pocket keyboard
targus had a great idea when they first came out with this keyboard but the latest crop of pocket keyboards makes the stowaway look like a technological dinosaur
if you must have a fullsize keyboard buy the stowaway but realize that youre not going to be able to use it in many conditions ie on a bus or train with no flat hard surface to put the keyboard on
you can use the pocket keyboard virtually anywhere and it is about half the price
of course youll be typing with your thumbs instead of the rest of your digits but i found that the pocket keyboard was much more usefulthis is a good lens for all around shooting especially outside
it does well in bright light but blurs badly in low light
with a tripod it does ok but this would not be my recommendation for inside or low light shooting without a flash
however for an all around carry lens at a reasonable price this is greatthe zoom range makes it really nicethis is my walk around lens for a d quickly replacing the kits lens that came with it
for the price you are getting a good performer optically and focus speed is snappy
although i do find that most shots need some lite photoshop touches to bring out the detail
recommend using f to avoid softness in the lower f settingsi have had version  and sold it due to a soft right edge
purchased used the original version  with the flower designation and it is better
this lens is fine on the apc crop cameras ie rebelsdd models but corners and contrast are weak on the d
i compared this lens under different conditions to the tamron mm and tamron xr  and the tamrons have better resolution to the corners and superior contrast and detail
the best setting for this lens on the d is at mm
it focuses quick and accurate so its just an ok lensthe sound is great but the ear coverings keep falling out all the time
even just putting it in your ear and have it fall out
lame lame lamei have used three different inear headphones mx koss the plug and shure c
shure c is in a different price league and is noticeably better in sound and build quality
between mx and koss the plug httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbadqsrqidrefpdbbsfencodingutf i would much prefer the plug with the mod described on  with the mod the plug becomes a very comfortable sound isolating inear monitor
the sound quality especially the low end is much better represented than mx
the thin foam covers of the mx is another problem
they easily fall off and break
unless you are willing to pay for shure c go for the koss earbud with the easy modthese headphones are alright
they are better than the cheap ones that come with most electronics these days but they wont blow your socks off
then again you are probably getting what you pay for since these wont exactly break the bankbut is good for the price
has a wide range but does not emphasis the bass which i like
but for a good accurate sound it is a good set for the pricebut theyre okay
as a matter of fact im not what youd consider an audiophile
although i wasnt totally dissappointed with these i ended up getting the mdrjsound quality while the sound of these are better than some similar priced earbuds the sound is just okay
the mdrj from sony in my opinion has a fuller bass though not clear treble that the mxs have
i have to turn up the bass on my player all the way up to get the bass out of the mx and it distorts a lot at high volume
if you dislike the sound of these id highly recommend trying some fontopias or the hear from sonydurability these seem to be pretty durable
the plastic is pretty tough but i wouldnt be suprised if they cracked or somethingportability theyre earbuds
nuff saidcost for the sound i think these are a little overpriced and should be around the  range rather than the  range
the treble is clear but the bassthe headphones free with my  cassette player had more bassoverall get something else for a better sounding experienceeven the you get what you pay for posts might admit that the mx may be the best inexpensive earbud product out there
with a full high range a surprisingly rich middle and satisfactory lows the sound actually eclipses the ipod earbuds
in fact some feel getting these as a replacement is a nobrainer
at this price one shouldnt of course expect stereophile quality i love the trebly sound but i have to confess that the sound can get a bit fatiguing
also as noted elsewhere the cord is rather short and the buds tend to get dislodged rather easilyall in all the mx offers a superior value for a cheapie earbud but it wont convince you that your earbud upgrade path is done quite yetafter being impressed with the mxs i decided to give these a try
when i opened them up and tested them out though i was disappointed
while they have good range there is too much treble and not enough bass
they can even sound tinny at times
the only major difference i found between these and the mxs was the higher treble and the volume control on the cord
i guess for the price difference i expected more but these just arent worth the extra money
if youre looking for a pair of sennheiser buds id recommend going with the mxs
theyre inexpensive and have better sound than the mxs in my opinioni do have another complaint and it is that the cord is way too short
when i came across these at an audiovideo store they had them in the dark blue and also in white to match an ipod
i looked at the specs on the package and while they were the same as expected the cord length was listed differently
the blue ones were stated as one meter just over three feet and the white ones read   meters about four feet
i prefer a longer cord so i picked up the white pair mainly for that reason
however these specs were incorrectly listed the cord was actually only three feet
now i plan on returning these and i hope that mentioning the cord issue saves someone else the hassleif you need a spare set and dont mind the cord or treble these may be good but if you want more bass keep looking
there are better ones out therethese earphones are ok sonically
not worse than youd expect for 
the bass response is nominal but i can tell that they are capable of good bass if you have large ear canals   i dont  and get them deep enough into your ear canal
this is apparent when you put some pressure on them while theyre in your ears  the bass increases dramatically
unfortunately i cannot maintain that state
volume is very good and the volume control attenuator works nicely
the cord could be a little longer
overall you could do much worse
recommendednot the crisp clear sound i was expecting
sonys cheapo  walmart version sound clearer and more solid than these
overall acceptable i guessi had read a lot about these but when i finally got them i was a little disappointed as they were not that great
ended up replacing them with a pair of cxs for airplane trips and pxs for home use
the latter are way superior to anything i have used with my ipod ever
but i do like the casesince i crushed my stock ipod earbuds in the elliptical trainerat the gym i needed to get a replacement set
after researchingfor a quite a bit it seemed that these earphones provided thebest bang for the bucki am not an audiophile like anyone with an mp would be andconsidering my main use of the ipod is for the gym i am notexpecting a lot from this type of setup
that said the soundi got from these headphones far exceeded what i was getting fromthe stock appleshowever i almost wish i had the stocks back
why
well mostlybecause these headphones do not stay in my ear
the slightestof tugs on the cord or least bit of tussle tough not to do atthe gym knock the buds from my ear canal severely changing thesound
speaking of which the cord is too short
my final nitis with the volume control slider
i wish it were lower on thecord
it happens to fall right between my chest and some of theweight machines i do
so slight movements of my body in thewrong direction have a tendency to alter the volume levellove the sound hate the ergonomics very clear sound but like all the earbuds ive tried theyhave very little bass response they also are a little too largeto fit in my ear for long after  mins they become uncomfortablei have the same problem with the creative labs buds tooi dont really have an opinion about the sound quality of these ear buds
they were so uncomfortable that i tossed them in the box of misfit toys after an hour of very uncomfortabe listening
the ear piece is the same basic design as the default apple earbuds but they feel larger in the earthe sennheiser mx lightweight inear headphone blue with carrying case product is ok they sound decent but the case is a bit difficult to use however i can see how some people might want it to prevent the cable from getting tangled
the earbuds are not very comfortable foam pads compared to todays gel overmold pads in  sizes which provide more comfort a better fit thus giving a more isolated soundthis review is for the sennheiser mx stereo inear headphones blue when used with a dell laptop crystal wdm audio
i disagree with a lot of folks who have compared these decent earbuds with dissimilar products
i did a comparison with a pair of panasonic rphc earbuds my pal had and the sennheiser wonpros frequency response is excellent hzhz for a variety of music
there is no manipulation to the sound and you hear the original notes with the same treble and basscons bass could have been a little more improved
some distortion in lower frequency ranges but only noticeable in very clear and high bitrate audio files
higher frequencies tend to produce a slight hiss again mostly noted in high bitrate audio filesoverall good buds at a slight premium the coil is too tight
any more than ten feet or so and it will pull your headphones off
not going to get anywhere near  unless you tie it off to your neck and the stereo firstthe cord reminds me of our old s phone cords
they were designed to not tangle but they were heavy
remember those
well this cord is not as heavy but the result is simlar
my headphones are pulled toward the sound source by this cordthis is not something i would buy if your are expecting  useful feet of cord
perhaps you might see  feet at best
it is also not very heavy wire and insulation
you will be better off going to some place like radio shack and putting an eyeball to this kind of product
i use it for my guitar amp
and headphone useage and it works just ok with a noticable hum in my ears when not playing the shielding is nonexistant but i get past it and get my guitar practice sessions in without driving my wife nuttysound comes through but keep in mind that the ft is all stretched out not all coily like the pic so buy a little longi bought this specifically to use with my phone while sitting at my desk so i didnt have to carry the phone with me
it is great for sound but the sound quality that goes back via the microphone on my headset which is normally crystal clear is terrible
constantly had to adjust the connector in the hole so the sound would get better but it wouldnt stay that way for longgood if youre just using it to listen to music or something  never had trouble with that  but not for talkingdthis kit does not include a female  to  male adapter the reason i bought the thing
the product description mentioned that you could connect the headphone to you home electronics
but it turns out thats only if youre connecting a headphone with a plug to a system with a  connectorits alright the extension seems to be made niceley but so far its held up
the headphone adapters really are not as sturdy as i personally like them to be but hey in the end they do end up getting the job donethe cable worked good to tranfer all of my steam games to my new laptop from my old laptop but it was a complicated process  did not tranfer at near the speed it should have i only got mbsec
i realize that the slow transfer was probably my fault but the description for this cable should explain that it is for experienced users only
i had to watch several youtube videos before i could figure it out  i still could not get more than a mbsec transfer rate
this cable should have transfered at a mbsec or mbsec speed
again i will say this issue i had was probably not a fault of this cable but perhaps they should send some step by step instructions with it instead of making people search the web for instructionsi bought this back towards the end of december  and the cable worked beautifully for many months but i noticed last week that i had not been getting very much bass out of my speakers for a while
i thought it was my  speakers but it turns out that when i wiggle the cable around i can get it into a position that allows the bass to come through normally
i havent abused the cable at all but it may be the case that light use an occasional light tug to get the cable out of my laptop causes the cable to become increasingly faulty
im considering getting a new cable that works more consistentlythis is probably too long of a review for what i paid a little over  so for the price i guess this isnt too bad of a deal if the cable is handled extremely gently hypothetically speakingi need both hands to work with
hooking this up just provides a little piece of mind
the cord could be longer and the clip stronger but otherwise okayit is light weight at least but all velcro with a metal flat piece
the cord is wound tight so there is a lot of spring to it as well as being short
the worst wrist strap i have ever seen
i doubt if it would last very long in an every day use kind of setting
as far as tightening it is good but material ahh
i am used to the professional wrist straps either being metal braclet blue something or other with band tightening stupid clip or burgundy with stupid clip but stays
not some cheap flimsy thing that is short in length
computer guys must be rating this
i guess if you touch electronics and it still works after you are done then this strap will get a good rating
colors are decent but the length and material to me is no goodvery uncomfortable and not so easy to use as it sticks around your wrist all the time and the metal keeps pressing into your skini realized this wasnt necessary in building computers i just had to touch the computer case every few minutesalthough i would recommend this if you really want an antistatic wrist bandi am an independent contractor for computer repair and this strap works just fine
it seems to work backwards though or i just havent figured it out yetthe band is reasonably well made for the price and is suitable for moderate use
it could be just a few inches longer but is not bad
 inches not stretched  inches at a reasonable stretch
the stretching has a little tougher pull than i would prefer but is not bad
the wrist band is not elastic which some may prefer
it fastens by a metal loop and velcro strap which can be a little of a nuisance to put on
if they made the metal loop  inch wider to allow the strap to pass through it easier it would be better
the alligator clip can be removed leaving an elongated pin that can be inserted into the ground hole of an outlet
where the wire snaps to the wrist strap the snap attaches and detaches easily
the snap rotates freely without any hangups
the usual  megohm resistanceworks as advertised however a pain in the but with the cord
the better item is the cord free clean room itemsit does the job
my only complaint is that the velcroe strap isnt very big
could use a longer straplike the piece tool kit i bought this with this is a very flimsy piece of equipment
it does what it needs to but thats itwore it when messing with connectors on my computer
no directions
i hope i didnt break anything
seems legit on the websiteif you value your computer you will need one of these to protect against static
the motherboard cpu and ram especially are very sensitive to it
the only issue i had was the arm band was almost too small i had maybe  to  to spare on the velcro when i got it around my armi did everything that the instructions told me too and didnt shock my computer
but i also discharged all of the static electricity before touching anything inside my computerthis solution does work but you might as well get antistatic gloves and not the cheap ones
i have pulled the clip off the case several times while working in a computer
the cord just needs to be a couple inches longer
i have only worn this once while working on a server rack and the client was very impressed with our professionalism but dont fool yourself you will not impress someone who knows what they are actually talking about
these things are cheap and if your wrist is large then this will not be easy to put on
at least these belkin ones are not as terrible as others i have seenthree stars because you can use these if you are trying to impress someone but if you pay attention to what you are doing esd is not a problem
there are plenty of things you should buy when working on computer i should have bought the gloves when i bought thisits a cat e cable at a very competitive price
it works
but i really dislike the design of the snagless cable ends used here
ive worked with a lot of different cabling over the years and i really dislike this style
if you are going to plug the cable into two devices and leave them there youll be fine
but if you find yourself moving the plugs between devices or ports on the same device even a few times you will find this design to be a hasslecable does the job albeit it isnt the quality type
one can easily see the marks made on the cable if it got twistedbented otherwise its good for easypermanent usethe short cable ft is rarely enough to get from one shelf to another and still allow room for devices to move ie swivel tvs
too bad they dont make ft cablei wanted usb  cables but order these by mistake
i have no need for them but will put away in a box just in casethis product does clean fingerprints and stains succesfully but dont expect much from the very fragile plastic device since it starts cracking and getting loose very soon
not for removing heavy stains or scratchesin an effort to achieve better audio quality i went thru of these
it seems to clean okhowever the flimsy design breaks after a few spins and the fluid left a film on the discs
i went with the memorex version instead
lasts longer and better results tyvmit is a cord i plug it in to the wall and the device and i have power
no fires no shocks so thats a plustheres a box in the basement with extra cords of every variety
this is now in the box
cisco wires seem much like others to me
what differences should i look forvendor was good and shipped well
the product itself is no good
the wipes dry out fastthe cable is good quality but not what i thought it was
it is not an ethernet cable
i dont know what it is used for but it doesnt fit the female plug on my computer
the blister pack was very hard to openthe cable is a beast and probably overkill since the phone line that is running in my walls is significantly inferior to this cable
i had no trouble fitting each end in their respective outlets
it was easily removed as well i just wanted to see since other reviews said it was tight
it is still tightly coiled up even though ive stretched it about  feet from the jack to my modem
bottom line  it works but i couldnt tell you if it was an improvement over what it replacedthis cable is designed for single insertiononce plugged in it stays plugged inthere is something wrong with the release latch
i had to file the latch points down a bit and that allowed for better latch and release but i shouldnt have to do that
not at these pricesother than that the cable works well for my dsl modem
reduced the dropouts i was having
i plugged it right into the phone box outside the house then routed it into the garage where i put the modema cheaper cable may have worked just as well i just didnt want to haveta route that wire twice so i paid a tad extra for this onei thought this modem cable will work to connect my uverse gatewayrouter to the network outlet on the wall
no joy the gateway boxwouldnt lock up to the network signal
i used a regular phone linecable and it worked fine failed out of the box and the other two work just finethis is the second time a belkin cable has gone baddo yourself a favor and get a no name brand usb cable as i seem to have better luck with themhavent really used it because it comes totally different from the pic
its a clear cord and through my past experience when something is different out the box other things are not far behind
so i junk drawlerd it
itmore than likely the same cable that most people sell just with a belkin stamp on it
works as designedthis are good cables
i have not used them as yet gave them to a friend because ii used cables  i already had on handdidnt last a year but it was cheap so i got what i paid for
it did a good job of charging
faster than most lowpriced cablesmot sure how to review a usb port without a test lab but here goes it works and ive had no problems with ititem was as described
these work fine and are low cost
that is why i bought them in the first place
try to find these in a store it is almost impossiblei mean it had continuity on all connections it was  feet long it was a good price and worked so there isnt much more to sayunless i just need to ramble to fill up the minimum number of wordskinda bad that amazonia land requires a wiring to go with a ratingkinda encourages you to not write a review i mean i came to amazonia for convenience and they complicate it with a long review processyou not suppose i can run them outta disc spacenaaaaa i cantso what do you think about the drone stuff they are thinking aboutonly in certain markets i dont know if it will be worth the increase in prices we will all experienceamazonia is a publically held land righti am not sure if it is working  percent or not because i have it wired to my ps
i wanted to wire the ps because when on wireless i would have some buffering when watching something on one of the apps
my desktop is wired and worked with no buffering so i thought i would buy this to speed up the app on the ps
the first few weeks it seemed to be alot faster but lately there is some buffering which is strange
the cable might not be the fastest but seems to be oki wanted cheap and that is what i got
though it says white the cable is actually gray when laid up against a white trim in my man caveits a cable that works  for how long i dont know nothing to get excited about
its ok so farworks fine
inexpensive
but it is not snaglessit can snag easily if not carefulit has some protection from snagsi prefer the snagless boot type of cable with rubber boot to protect cable
linksys cable or cables sold by ultra spec on amazon is better choice
get snagless boot designa great price and it works but not what i was looking for and didnt know the difference
it will not work unless you have another vga cable to hook it up too
my badi cant say that improve my connection but it works fine like a regular cord but with better materials regardsthis is a well thought out little kit that is ideal for working with ultra small screws and parts used in computers and small motors and for working with intricate parts
the quality is good and the combination of tools is great
i would probably buy it againits an ok product and i cant complain
though i cant think of any useful application for the ic puller in any of my contemporary systems
i tossed this tool and used the space for an small knife this is good film if you have a camera that requires polaroid  film but when it comes down to numbers youre paying five bucks per shot which is a pretty penny
the film is good quality  or as good as you can get but then again i shouldnt complain
if i find myself whining about the quality ill just use my digital camerait is a decent cable it does what you pay for though its really hard the coating of the cablenothing extraordinaryafter about four  a half years it diedbut if youre considering a reader get a reader
i bought this for a friend who had no reader now she has to use her printer which is w a y too sloooooooooow
i recommend anything from sandisk the cards are still going after  photos  bazillions of transferred files and we never lost a filesee lexar reco
multi readerswriters are out in abundance now so look at them
make sure it writes to the card not just read ityou get what you pay for belkin cables may cost a few pennys more and they are worth that cost when you are making a long runive had this usb hub for about six months and it has worked flawlessly so far with one very notable flaw
devices which derive their power from usb like some webcams cameras and scanners will not work with this device
so far my webcam is the only thing that will not work with the hub
my mice yoke usb pedals joystick pdaphone cradle and anything else i have plugged in worked finethe ac power adapter is bulky and not really needed considering this box doesnt act like a good selfpowered usb hub anyway
i was able to disconnect power and it still works fine and free up some space on my power stripmeh
for the use i got out of this i might as well have bought one of the cheap generics
what i mean is that i would have expected a cheap noname hub to perform this well but it may well be that theyre even worsethis is the rd one of  these i have purchased the other  were years ago
this one for some reason has one plug slot that i cant get anything to plug into something is plugging the holes all seem to be difficult to get plugs into the firsrt time
i have never lost a electrical item plugged into the other two so am hopeful that it will at least work
living in south east louisiana we have lots of thunderstorms so anything sanative has to be on a  surge protector
these newer ones seem to be fabricated cheaper than the ones sold say  years agoso i like the anti static wrist band the double ended screwdriver has been useful the screw and parts case has come in handy already the tri pronged screw holder pickrupper has already proved invaluable i hope it holds up
dont think i will ever use the main screwdriver as i have better quality here already
kind of useless to have a bunch of standard size screw bits and screwdriver in an electronics repair case
definitley lacking in electronics gauged bits  actually ridiculously so  phillips  flatthats itan average tool set
covers most of the basics even though it does not have everything that one may need
it does include a few items that will rarely be used
seems to be cheaply made products
construction could have been better
gets the job done on a fairly basic leveli bought this kit because i didnt have the necessary general tools at home needed to work on computers
the tools themselves are of decent quality so this is a fair product for the price
however now that i have stacked up on tools i find myself using those instead of reaching for this case when working on computer hardware in general
if you need a small case that you can carry around with you then this would be better value but for home use the value is questionable if you have a decent general toolkitill start off by saying the tools were mostly great quality
they all felt solid and no doubt would be useful for small fixes round the house
however i predominately work with laptops and the screwdriver bits are just too big for most laptops
there were a lot of different torque sizes but only  phillips heads and  or  flat ones
the ones that were provided were solid and worked well but they were too large for laptop screws
it could have easily been fixed if they included smaller bits but they did not
thats really my only gripe but since that was the only reason i bought it i had to return it
no problem with quality and the price is cheap for what you get and i would have to blame myself if the kit wasnt marketed for computers but since it was i had to mark it down a tad
will probably head to best buy and get the dynex version i saw as its almost identical to this but includes smaller bits as well for around the same pricei really like this tool kit because it contains a basic assortment of tools
it has everything i need to tinker with and take apart computers and electronics
this kit lost two stars because of one problem the wire stripercutter does not cut well
they strip fine but dont seem to be sharp enough to cut well
three stars is a pass but wish i had paid less for this kit which such a major flawwhat could be simpler than securing your laptop with a cable lock
i bought this product and a year later was still trying to figure out how to get it to work
i am able to lock and unlock the unit easily by itself but it just would not lock when i inserted it into the slot on my laptop
the pin looks nonstandard when compared to some of the cable locks i have seen before and does not turn when inside the slotmonths later i finally cracked the case
i had to push  really push hard  so that the locking part would enter far enough into the laptop security slot
this would happen through a compression of the little piece of rubber that sits against the laptopat least i can use the cable now
phewits construction is fairly cheap and because its sizeweight the hub tips when placed at the back edge of my desk or tower computer
not a huge deal but pretty much all the usb hubs are the samethough im going to try the kensington that is weighted to prevent tipping has a spacesaving standing configuration has  ports in the back of the hub and one in the front a great ideai bought these to use when mowing the lawn
they have a good sound quality and reduce the ambient noise but they have no size adjustment at all
the band connecting the two ear phones is one size fits all  which typically means one size fits nobody and even though i flex this piece of metal as much as possible they are really tight on the head
as a  female i cant help but wonder how a larger male could tolerate them
i have to flex them quite often to prevent head pain and pressure below my ears but so far i am still surviving them
the cord is nice but really long
i will probably have them permanently bent soon but hopefully they will be still useful
why cant they come with some type of size adjustment
it seems odd to me
i understand the need to keep out ambient noise but pleasei bought this for work since i work in a very noisy environment
the passive noisecancelling is superb no batteries required
theyre pretty tight on your head and take a while to get used to and will be uncomfortable the first few times wearing them
they stay snug on your head though
sound quality was average not particularly great for music but good enoughi rate them only  stars because after a few months they wore out
the ear cushion is apparently filled with a liquid gel and the cushion became brittle and tore the oily gel leaked out
kosss warranty makes you pay for shipping and since i only paid  for them it wasnt worth it
these headphones may be  fine for occasional use but if you plan on using them every day like i did at a job they wont last and i would suggest getting something more durablei purchased this toolkit to take to work with me at a computer repair shop
there were tools there but i wanted to have my own personal seti will start off by saying that as others have said the soldering iron doesnt work
i plugged it in it heated up and started smoking
im suspecting it has something to do with the synthetic wire thats inside of it running the leads to the tip
the tip however was removable and is a great tip to use for another soldering iron that worksthe flashlight just doesnt cut it
it barely gives any light at all and is easy to fall apart
the part that holds the batterya pretty long slim metal rod and coil at the end can be used for reaching things in screw holessuch as wires in the way of laptop case screwsthe other tools however are great
the plastic grip on the interchangeable screwdriver is great
i havent tried the black carbon tools out yet because i really have no need for them
the exactocutter works great and is very very very sharp
the small screwdriverflathead with the belkin logo on it is an okay screwdriver as well except it lacks a good gripall in all its an okay deal for what i paid for
i was expecting more out of it though
 star taken away for the soldering iron and flashlight that didnt work and one star for not having better quality tools in it and the fact that the tools slip out so easilyi like the size of the kit and the selection of tools
it appears to have the basics to perform field maintenance on most consumer computers systems
the zippered case looks to be of good qualitythe only minor items for me are the nonmagnetic driver has a spring clip that holds in a tiny ball bearing the bearing locks the bits in place when in use
unfortunately if a person gets to playing with the spring clip in the wrong way the little bearing will fall out
you can either be careful or else replace this with a better designed driver
i already had a stanley driver of similar design
the stanley uses a metal collar rather than the spring clip so no chance of anything falling out of that
i replaced the original driver with my existing stanley
the flashlight is functional but reeks of a s kids toy
one of the kits positions was occupied by a cellophane wrapped two pack of aa batteries
i hope that did not count as two of the  parts
i replaced the battery packs position with a led aaa powered light that is smaller and of much better quality
the position that the old flashlight occupied was filled by my esd wrist strap and grounding strap connector
my humble biased opinion is that a computer service kit without simple esd connections is not a computer service kit
the last minor thing
the kit contains a soldering iron and solder wick but no solder
whats up with that
i can unsolder a wire but not reconnect it
minor stuff i do realize that lead solder is now considered a hazardous substance
ill add a little of my own solder into the kit and be happy with thati have been working in electronics construction repair and servicing since i was nineteen
i am now above fifty in age
if that means anything to anyone
would i recommend this to a fellow worker as a must buy front line kit
no
i will carry it in my car as a backup or in the event i have to perform some emergency field work
it is not something that i would agree to use every day on the job as is
this is my own opinion others will varykeni like having a full range of tools but the quality of the tools is undeniably low
next time i will splurge a little for a nicer setthe tools included make a decent basic computer toolkit
the tools are unlikely to break with heavy use but they will certainly rust eventually
ive been using these kits in various forms for years and all the pliers and bit drivers have ended up rustythe soldering iron is cheap
the flashlight is crapi would gladly pay another  for the kit if it contained a powerful led flashlight with a smaller footprint and a basic power driver instead of the manual ratchet driveri purchased this case for building a computer and it fulfilled my expectations
the kit included a nice socket and bit set as wells as some wrenches
i have used the multiple tools in other non computer related instances
so versatility is a definite plus of this kit set
my issue is with the overall quality of some of the items the flashlight lasted only a few hours with the batteries that came with the case
if they marketed this product as an antistatic kit it would have been nice to have a antistatic wrist wrap included as well
a good case however the fit and finish could have been improved upon in my opinionunfortunately lenovo has not yet seen fit to release a vistacompatible driver so the laptops keyboard and the numeric keypads number lock feature are in sync under vista
in other words if you want to type numbers on the numeric keypad why else would you buy it
using windows vista the portion of your laptops keyboard that substitutes for a numeric keypad will also type numbers
obviously for quick data entry it quickly becomes annoying to have to constantly toggle the num lock keytargus makes a similar keypad that does include a vista driver to avoid this annoying behavior so that you can input text on your laptop keyboard and numbers on your numeric keypad
it does not however have the standard key layout which is the feature i like most about this modelupdated sept  lenovo has released a vista driver for this keypad so it now works as it should
you can activate num lock on the keypad and still type properly on the laptop keyboardim not an audiophile in the sense that i have a  receiver and a  speaker setup but i like upper midgrade and lower highend sounding audio equipment
im always looking for budget audio equipment that delivers excellent sound comparative to more expensive stuff the koss proaa did not fit that bill for meif you read reviews very carefully many of them are basing the sound quality on the originals gel ear pads s vomit green color
but i read positive reviews on even the new ones supposedly so be warywithout a headphone amp the soundstage think stereo widening or feeling encompassed in sound is terrible
the bass is pathetic and the uppermid to high end is very weak
i even burned them in after two weeks of usage for about  days nonstop running frequency sweeps pink noise and white noise through them hoping that the sound would improve it didnt
my ultra cheapo sennheiser hds and koss kscs sound much better in every application i attemptedi tried two different sound cards sound blaster audigy nx razer ac and also directly into my sony  receiver
the sound stayed basically the same lifeless
no matter how i tweaked the eq or how loud i cranked it it still sounded lifelessthe only thing i can think of is that you need a headphone amp in order for these to sound any good at all
the impedance on these suckers is a whopping ohms
compare that to the hds ohms or even the hds at ohms
for all you average joes out there that means that you need way more juice to get these things to work well
i just wish someone said that before i bought themso basically these will sound terrible if you dont use a headphone amp
i just wish i had an amp to test these with a proper amount of juice
so if you dont want to use an amp look at the sennheisers or gradossummary buy a headphone amp or look elsewheremaybe i am exaggerating but these are fine headphones except the treble seems muted
these are also lacking in imaging somewhat in the midrange on an absolute scale
try the behringer  series headphones which sound better and are less expensiveive had two pair of proaas in the past ten years or so
my first pair belonged to my dad and were used by him for technical purposes
id been using them for music and i assumed that the proaas had the best cleanest most accurate sound
ive since learned that the best cleanest and most accurate sound probably doesnt exist and even if it does you wont get it with these headphonesdont get me wrong here
on my rating scale a  is pretty good think of it as one standard deviation above average
i definitely wouldnt call these cans bad but they are seriously flawed
they are very heavyuncomfortably so
wearing these headphones for an hour caused serious pain for my ears neck and scalp
two hours wearing them gave me a headache for the rest of the nightas for the sound i got the distinct impression that their sound reproduction quality and accuracy was excellent but the sound from any source for any kind of music felt intensely confined
these are the most closed headphones ive ever used
because they are so tightly sealed by such heavy material you will get some serious bouncing so dont expect a soundstage larger than the inside of your skull
the general effect is crowding claustrophobic and at high volume overwhelmingfor some kinds of music dense droning broad range of tonesmy examples are nadja and jesu these cans actually add to the effect
for other music lighter more empty spaceessentially anything made before  and most music made since the closed design of these headphones condenses and cheapens the sound collapsing some music into an unsubtle mono mushon the plus side these phones are amazingly wellbuilt
there is a lot of substantial metal involved and any plastic parts are made from the highest quality super strong typesno cheap brittle plastic here just dense and flexible
the coiled cord is a godsend and more or less indestructible
the only structural weakspots i could find are the holes where the wires enter each headphone
i once dropped my second pair far enough to actually loosen one of the wires resulting in the right channel cutting out intermittently but with the shockingly generous warranty plan offered by koss i mailed my pair in and received the same pair fixed in a few days
qualitywise these phones easily outstrip any model in the same price range and many models that are more geared for serious music listening my chintzy but liquid buttersounding grados come to mindoverall this reviews title says it all like a suit of armor these headphones are powerful but have limited uses
if you absolutely need noise attenuation without active cancellation no sound gets in or out of these headphones period
but if you really want to get lost in your music try an open designyou can get lost in the sound the proaas provide but youll be running around a pretty small block out of  but only because it may be right for some  but not for methe positive  the sound quality is very good
the most flat or uncolored of any ive tried
the product literature says something like why go from  hz to  khz when the human ear can only hear from  to   because if the curve drops off at the limits its already getting lower at the edges than it is in the middle
the extra db at the edges makes for better ability to hear all the way from edge to edge
so you hear the higher highs and lower lows you didnt know you were missing
i use headphones for music editing rather than casual listening and i need to hear it all
others have mentioned how ruggedly built they are
they should easily withstand years of use and could probably outlive the user
excellent sound isolation as well for listening in a noisy environment or for keeping others from being bothered by what you are listening tonow to the negative  i read the reviews but i thought all those that complained about the weight and pressure were just wimps
well i believe the warnings now
and for those with ears that dont lie flat against their heads well theres no more depth to the cushions on these than on any other pair  maybe a half inch off the head but once on the cushions compress down to about  and that puts the speaker grille right against the ear pressing on itive tried many headphones in my quest for the best  best for me  because they might be best for you
they certainly are great sounding  to me  just not comfortable enough
the headphones ive tried that are more comfortable for large ears dont always have the specs i need for critical listening
so do read all the reviews take them with a grain of salt as my grandma used to say even this one
i am critical but practicalthe comswitch  has been around for a long time and is a consistant performerif you can get it programmed
i use it to catch fax transmissions before they go to my avaya telephone system
programming the switch requires patience and time
the actual wiringhookup is simple as command communications states
programming is another matter
read the program manuel and write down or highlight the programming that you want
once programmed it should work as statedthe nd but important fact about the unit is that it seems to have low resistance to any type of surges
i have individual surge protection on both my ac power source and my bell lines for the phone system and the  i also have a wholehouse surge protector installed
i have two dead  units in my basement now
their power supplies seem ok the units just will not power upstill inspite of its faults the comswitch  is the best unit ive found to dateeven after following the instructions which came with the unit  those accompanying my fax machine it doesnt route the fax messages properlythis is a very useful soho headset amplifier
it allows you to switch between the telephone and your computers audio voip or messenger audio etc
using the same headsetit should be noted that you must use one of the professional plantronics telephone system headsets and not a pc headset or cordlesscellular headset
the plantronic headsets are very good but have different connectors than standard cordlesscellular headsetsonly problem is this unit has had a slight humming line noise when used with the telephone since it was new
since my phone wasnt on the official plantronics compatibility list i assumed that my low cost phone was probably to blamei just replaced my old phone with a two line att  soho phone that should be compatible  its not on plantronics compatibility list but there are so many phones out there i dont know how they could possibly check all phones on the market or even a fraction of them
after all its nearly impossible to look at the compatiblity list and try to buy a phone that meets your needs and is also on the list
the mx is supposed to have near universal compatibilitythis new phone has the same line hum as the old phone both are att phonesi sent for a replacement mx so well see if theres a problem with the amplifier or a compatiblity issue with both of my att phonesthe headset is crystal clear when used through the soundcard of the computer in all of the audio programs that i usei just bought an mx a few days ago
the good news it works
another good news it came with an ac power adaptop so i dont need to replace batteries anymorehere is what i dont like price
if you look at this device and at its price tag they dont seem to be a good fit
proprietary head speakers
the amplifier will work with pretty much any desk phone but it requires proprietary plantronics head speakers and they are way more expensive then competitors
you can feed one input from the phone and the other one from the computer
you can also let your phone party listen you computer music when you put your phone on mute
but you cant mix  signals
you cant talk over your computer signal and let the person on the phone listen to both
also you cant feed your phone signal into the computer
adding an ability to mix signal would allow you to recordreplay sound from the computerphoneoverall this amplifier does basic functionality ok it might meet your expectations but unlikely will exceedok first of all it was a good price and decent shippingonly after receiving it did i realize whyit is not an authentic apc battery but a third party knockoff
this is manufactured by abc batteries and not apcthe image on the site is an apc manufactured battery but that is not what you getvery misleading basically false advertising
does it make a difference yesmy last apc battery lasted  years in a smart ups the first and last time i ordered a knockoff brand it didnt last a year
be careful what you order from these guys because you dont know what youre gettingbattery works but wished the price was cheaper
same battery as what was in my unit so i bought thisi purchased two of these to do a house wiring install
they at first had some problems when spooling out the downspout that goes into the spool was broken and i had to fiddle with the cable to prevent it from kinking up for the first couple hundred feet
other than that no complaintsthis burner is rated for x writes and anybody whos up on cdrw drives knows that means it should be able to burn a full cd in about  minutes
however this drive typically takes  minutes to burn a cd
tried the support section of the iomega website but could not find an answer to this problem until i read the other reviews here at amazon that mention certain brand media is required to write at the full xwell if memorex cdrs isnt good enough for iomega then this drive shouldnt be good enough for you
my yamaha x performs great no matter what brand media you use so i would recommend you take a look at one of those insteadi think im really reaching here to give this drive three stars but it does workmore like a x with most media
id probably be more annoyed if it was slated to reside in my primary computerive had this monitor about a week
upon getting it and hooking it up i was very impressed with the brightness of the screen and the quality of images
although when using the web text particularly smaller text is very fuzzy and looks like it fadeshowever today i encountered a major problem
do not use the highlight feature
while exploring what my monitor could do i pressed the highlight button to highlight a portion of my screen and it seems to have blown out the backlight on the monitor
now everything is nowhere near as bright as it was when i purchased the monitor except for a few seconds after returning on the highlight feature
my ie pages now appear off white unlike the brillient white they were just earlier todayill be returning this to samsung for a replacementalthough i adjusted the refresh rate to hz still not goodwhen connected to my hometheater system via svideo it sent an unacceptably loud humbuzzhiss back thru the audio system when the lcd display was on
when i switched video inputs via the frontpanel the display would momentarily blank the noise would disappear and as soon as the display came back on it would start up again
i have no way of knowing if i had a defective unit or this was a designflawotherwise i found this unit fascinating and impressive
i ran it a lot using svideo from both directv satellite and from dvd
depending on the quality of the source it could produce amazing images with no scanlines
the cool thing about it is that it can upconvert i to p and make it look pretty decent
however mediocre source read cable tv and vhs will look poortoterrible because this unit mercilessly reveals flaws in the source material that a regular soft tv display conceals
also amusingly it occasionally revealed small blocky mpeg artifacts on some of the standard directv channels which i dont normally see its wellknown that they dynamically allocate bandwidth giving more to premium and sports channels
i would expect digital cable to fare worsei adjusted this unit using the video essentials dvd
the big plus was its absolutely unbelievable horizontal resolution
i saw fine resolution detail in verticalline test displays that i had never seen before this probably explains why it looks poor with lowquality source material
high res  i upconversion  poor source  bad picture especially when there is a lot of motion
the two big downsides were   it cannot do absolute blacks well at all and  the most damning is that the graytemperature is set very high making blacks and grays look distinctly bluish and there is no adjustment to compensate which i am aware of
these two problems will kill this unit off for most videophiles its a common design problem
note that my final settings for svideo were  brightness  contrast  sharpness  definitely
 color  strange but true and tint consider for future hdtv that this unit is not  and it does not have component video inputs present in the pricier mp modeli just received this filter and the first thing i noticed taking it out of the oversized shipping box was that the plastic case the filter came in was scuffed all over as if someone had rubbed it with sandpaper
i didnt think it was a problem as long as the filter was ok  unfortunately upon opening the unsealed case i noticed that the lens was very dusty on both sides and there was a big fat thumb print right in the middle of the lensi tried cleaning the filter with a lens cleaning cloth and it helped to remove the dust but i could not remove the thumb print completely
i cant see the print anymore with the naked eye but when i blow on it the steam makes it reappear until it evaporates
i decided that it was probably not going to affect the pictures much since i couldnt see the print when it was drythe performance of the lens is decent
i can see the picture change on my viewfinder as i rotate the filter
i do find that the rotating part is loose
if the camera shakes or moves too much the lens can rotate slightly on its own
i wish there was a little more resistance to it but most people will try their best to take shots with a steady hand so it shouldnt be a problem
the photos also come out a little darker than without the filter so i use it only in bright sunlighti decided to keep the filter since it wasnt too expensive
it was disappointing to receive a filter with the permanent thumbprint which could have come from the tiffen factory or from amazon sending me a used items as new
ive heard of others claiming to receive used items from amazon so i wouldnt be surprised
you may end up receiving a new one but its no guaranteethis polarizing filter seems a bit on the week sidewhen aiming it at lcd screens i can not get it to black them out completelydoes the job though not as dramatic of change as other cpls i have had
use it on my sigma  and with adapter on the canon fpolarizing effect works as advertised
it does cause significant vignetting when used on a tamron mm on an a
may work better for telephoto lensesit takes much more work with this polarizer in comparison to others ive used to beging to understand how to use it correctly
the biggest challenge is eliminating unnecessary vignetting that can not be eliminatedeven with painstaking effortsin the development process i use lightroom photoshop and a full suite of topaz products
the real challenge is the vignetting is tough to pick up through your view finder and in reviewing it on the camera monitor
despite all of that it is capable of toning down sundrenched objects and in bringing out brilliant colors
my best advice for the tiffen is to shoot wider then you normally would when using it and shoot more photos of the same subject and angle than you thought necessaryon my d the lens caps do fit this filter but they dont catch very much of the thread maybe  or  threads
this isnt a problem but if this filter was on my lens all the time i might not like the fact that it doesnt fit all the way to the bottomother than that this filter seems to be a good valuethe tiffen mm circular polarizer is affordable but i couldnt see that noticeable of a difference using it compared to some even cheaper polarizers ive used in the past
it also got stuck on my lens the first time i tried it
i struggled with a rubber band putting it in the freezer etc
for nearly an hour trying to get it off
i finally handed it over to my roommate so he could give it a try
i was terrified hed break it so i watched over him and coached him on how to hold it
luckily he got it off without incident
needless to say ive ordered some filter wrenches in case this happens againthere is not much you can say about a polarizing filer unless you have a problem with it
i have not detected any distortion or aberration due to using the filter and it rotates quite easily
it works for meit does prevent some flare but the main reason i use it is for protecting my lens
however it does let flare in so thats why im giving it  starsi am big fan of tiffen
the last circular polarizer i had was for mm diameter lens and worked great
it was the only filter i ever really needed and it put life in every outdoors picture for most part that i ever tookso i consider having a circular polarizer a must for any outdoors or nature shooterhaving a great faith in tiffen filters due to past experience i did not think twice before buying the mm versionsad to say that this particular filter is poorly designed
it is too think so it is difficult to find it to even rotate it
it doesnt seem to fit very well so difficult to rotatei could live with both of those characteristics
however if i am at  degrees from the sun i am used to getting great picture as that is perfect angle for circular polarizer to do its magicwith this particular filter it is difficult to say if it is having any effect at all
sometimes it appears it is having an effect but i am used to effect being strong and clear i had to over rotate them to reduce the impactso for passionate photographers i would recommend they try their luck elsewhere
this filter is bit cheaper but it is not worth spending whatever it coststhis is a good filter for the money and gives good results if youre not shooting toward an extremely light background
but it creates serious vignetting if you shoot toward a light background such as a tree against the sky or snowcapped peaks in the distance
the resulting dark vignette is so extreme that you cant eliminate it with photoshopyou can reduce it but its still visible and if you go farther you will start to create a light vignette at the corners of your imagebe aware to the fact that the lens may come cover with dusty film
it is advised to clean the lens before use or your shoots with be with no real contrast make shure you know your ambient lighting if not your photos may come out a little distorted in color  its very good for very bright sun lightgenerally tiffen makes good uv filters and other static ones
i found this circular one to not be very effective didnt notice much difference when rotating
i was at the  degree angle too the sun as suggested tooi paid  for this filter and i have also ordered several other of their filters
they get the job done but they arrive in terrible condition
they always come covered in dust and somtimes small smudges  not what you expect from a new product
however a compressed air to blow off the dust and  ethanol with lens paper cleans them up nicely
this item does not turn smoothly to adjust the polarizationthis is a nice quality polarizerive not gotten full use yet but i still need to check this out compared to another polarizeri like the quality of this polarizer because it is smooth is how it rotates and is solida great buy if you are looking for a polarizeryou should check out photographic reviews to see if how tiffen brand polarizers are what you are looking foreach brand may be lighter or darker in the image you get so look into that as part of your researchthis polarizing filter fits fine on the mm lenses of my sony alpha camera
however when i first removed the filter from the case it was very dirty
i dont expect to start out by having to clean a camera accessory before it can be used
im in doubt about this having been a factory sealed itemeveryone always says that you should use a cpl filter to really make your landscape photos pop
im not entirely sold on that though
thereve been a few shots with a lot of glare or a really bright sky where its helped  and theres been just as many shots where it seemed like it was helping only to cause the photo to look horrendous and unnatural once i loaded it onto my computerperhaps i just need to get better at learning when to use it and when not to but it seems that much of the benefit of this filter can be achieved by shooting in raw and doing a bit of creative curvebalancing in lightroomif you think this is the strongest nd filter you can get then it is wrong
do not buy this
this is only stop and there are  or  stop filters available
learn about nd filters before settling on onesignificant color shift and image degradation on my mm f
returned it and added another hoya filter to my collectionfirst off  this filter isnt horrible
if you have cheap glass or want a certain effect but if you have a premium lens  get a premium filter  it really does make a differencegreat filter
i have used this many times for a sunrise time lapse project and it really balanced out the exposure
i kept it attached to my mm most of the time and it didnt take long before the glass came loose inside of the ring
i dont think it effects the performance at all but it feels much cheaper when handling when you hearfeel the glass rattlinghavent used filters on my dslr but this one makes good results need to try more shots with waterfalls and streaming riverfits on lens and does its job
filter makes the picture a lot darker than anticipated
definitely have to crank up the iso for outside shotsexcellent for making creative photos explore and enjoy other times light photograph of a slightly differently
you will not regret itnot sure why i chose this one now that a variable filter is available but it will still likely get some use
i cant carry my camera bag as it isi paid  for this filter and i have also ordered several other of their filters
they get the job done but they arrive in terrible condition
this particular items case opened during shipping and this added a couple little scratches to it
they always come covered in dust and somtimes small smudges  not what you expect from a new product
however a compressed air to blow off the dust and  ethanol with lens paper cleans them up nicelyi bought this product last year to use in long exposure photography during daylight hours
my negative review of this product is not in relation to the amount of light it reduces it does that just fine and as advertised but more in the quality of images that can be taken with this filter over the lens
to put it bluntly it sucks
the clarity goes way down and the contrast goes way downon the plus side it does fit my mm lens perfectly and comes with a nice case with which to carry it in
that said the nice case it came with is where it will stay from now until the end of timeif you are after taking some nice long exposure shots in the day look elsewhere
if you are a soccer mom dslr owner then this is your nd filtergreat quality but i need more nd filters to make it useful so i bought a variable nd filter made by tiffen which serves me very wellthis is not blocking as much light as i had hoped
i want to be able to leave the shutter open for longer periods for moving water etc
i can hardly tell a difference with this
i am going to have to get a stronger filtertiffen filters are usually of the highest quality so i was quite unhappy when i received the filter that i was sent
the glass was not fabricated large enough and slips around in the framering
a close examination shows that the filter glass does not completely fill the inside opening of the framering
the price for this handy filter was really very good so i do hope and expect that the replacement will not have this defect as again tiffen is and has been a leader in lens filters and the others i own are quite perfecti was lead to believe this filter was multicoated probably from amazon giving me similar results in my search
its quite obviously not
for a casual photographer they probably wouldnt care but such filters will cause ghosting and reflective flaresstarted shooting right after received the lens tonight
tried to shoot at the light bulb and could see the flaring
took off the glass shooting the same object flare was gone
tried different light bulbs and results were same
too bad
so i guess it maybe same results with day time into the suni were paring with canon mm fmm
not sure if i want to keep it
for protection its the one but the flare really bothers menot a bad product at all but make sure you know what youre getting
i had one major concern about the design of this filter that i did not think would be such a big deal until i started using it
since this screws onto the front of your lens the center of the gradient is always fixed in the center
its nice that it rotates but can cause serious composition problems
even at wideangles i was finding myself cutting off important parts of my landscape shots so that the horizon was centered which is usually not the greatest way to compose a shot
eventually i got so tired of dealing with it that i put the filter away and never used it againthis works well for skys but it can cause vignetting especially if using it without any sky showingim using it on a nikon d with both an    and a    lensits possible there are secrets to using it that i dont know
i have only tried it on one shooting expedition
if i use it again and like it better ill update my review
and if anyone has any suggestions about how to use it ill be glad to hear themi bought this and used it on a new nikon d took a couple test shots with it installed on my lens and then took a couple more pics with it off when i compared the images i could not see any difference in the exposure on the pictures
couldnt even tell which ones had the filter on it
it was a bright sunny day here on the gulf and was not early morning or late evening so i will need to try some more test pics however my first impression is it just isnt dark enough to make a difference either that or the new nikon adjusted to give an almost identicle exposure even though my tast shots were done in aperature priority mode all at the same aperature
next time i will try it in full manual mode and lock in both aperature and shutter speed to make my test shots
if that helps then i will know manual setting will be the best way to go i will update this review after my next test photos i returned the d and am waiting for delivery of the d as soon as that gets here i will retry my test pics and update this reviewi thought this would be more useful than it is
its graduated but theres still a hard stop at the end of the graduation and not an imperceptible transition
that stop line is obvious in any shot without a continuous merger across the scene ie
the horizon
it makes this of limited use for anything beyond scenery shotsthe build quality is ok the rotating ring is loser than my hoya circular polarizer but its not a problem
the first time i put it on my lense it was so lock tight i thought id cross threaded it and had an ordeal getting it back offa graduated neutral density filter can be extremely useful when taking photographs
it can go a long way to improving photographs of a bright sky with a medium foreground
without this if you set your camera for a properly exposed sky the foreground will be too dark and if you expose for a properly exposed foreground the sky is all washed out with no detail
with a graduated neutral density filter like this one though you can rotate the dark part of your filter to cover the sky and leave the clear part on the foreground
when you set your exposure for the foreground the darker neutral density top part of the filter tones down the sky so it appears properly exposed too
its a fantastic addition to the filters you need for a lot of outdoor photography
the  rating of this filter means the darkest part of the filter reduces the amount of light transmission by two stops
it graduates from  to clearim not a photo lab or professional photographer so i didnt do a qualitative analysis of this particular filter against other graduated neutral density filters from manufacturers such as heliopan cokin nikon leica hoya or others so i cant say how it compares against other  graduated filters or against other graduated filters with higher or lower density
i can say however that im satisfied with the performance of this tiffen filter
its a glass filter which puts it a cut above plastic filters
it has a black aluminum frame which makes it sturdy and the black finish wont cast reflections or glare on the filter glass
its not multicoated
multicoated filters are recommended for digital photography because they eliminate problems with reflection and glare on the filter glass which can end up in the image and ruin the image
apparently this is much more likely to occur with digital images than with film or slides
i havent had any of those problems with this filter yet though
its easy to use and so far has produced clear nicely exposed images with my digicam for the recreational amateur photography i do
there are certainly higher priced graduated nd filters out there and if youre shooting professional photos with a highend dslr camera youll probably want to choose a higherend multicoated filter
for recreational amateur photography though this filter adequately meets my needsi had experienced with some other filters in the past so i had great expectations on this one
i found out that the density is somewhat mild and that because of this the results are barely noticeablei now wish i would have gone for the interchangeable filters with varying degrees of densitybiggest turn off to this product is that it has a tendency to get stuck on the lensi went for this as a cheap and convenient alternative to the square gnd filter that needs frame and all
the results have been disappointing as well
i hardly use it now as the situations where this is helpful is very lessif you are reasonably serious about gnd filters dont waste the  in this producthas anyone tried thisi have a problem with a video projector that is too bright for rear projection despite running it under theater mode and lowering the brightness as far as the epson s allows
im hoping that one of these filtersprobably the  versionwill cut the brightness down yet retain the colors while reducing the annoying light spot bleeding through the screen
i just have to figure out a way to hold the lens at the proper distance from the front of the projector so it doesnt interfere with the projected image
the larger filter size would be more flexible but the tradeoff is expense
i thought a  might work well but i have to check what my old mm lens will accept
might as well get something i could use with my film camera and i think i remember having a mm wide angle lensupdate still waiting for this item to ship but i did end up buying a mm size that will also fit my wide angle slr lensthis is an ok product
for the price it is ok but it does affect the clarity of my pics when i use it on my mm  primeit is usable but i would not rate this filter highly as it affects colors and clarity
it helps in cutting down the ambient in sunlightto summarize  for the price  it is ok could have been bettertiffen filters are good enough for general use but do not use the same quality of glass as the bw and other often more expensive filters nor do they have the multi coating of the surfaces to minimize flare and ghosting
that is fine for occasional use and for people on a budgetthis filter is an exception in that is priced at the same level as the bw filters with their schott glass and other higher quality coated filters
anytime you add a piece of glass in front of your lens there will be some degradation of image quality
you can minimize it by using multicoated filters and the best glass you can affordthe tiffen nd filters are not a good value at the current selling price as you can buy bw and other better quality filters in the same price rangeb  w mm  neutral density glass filter    xhoya mm x  neutral density multi coated glass filterfilters are a life long investment
they will never wear out and can be used over the years with many cameras and many lenses so it is not a place to try to economize
you can get double duty often by using a step up ring so that a mm filter can easily be used with a lens that takes a smaller size filter
the rings are not expensive and take up very little room in your camera bag
better to buy quality filters in the largest size you are likely to use for your lenses and then make use of the step down rings with your smaller lenses  though lens hoods may not work with these rings in place you can use a flag or your hand to take the place of the hoodadorama stepup adapter ring mm lens to mm filter sizei bought these just for playing aroundthey are worth the very low pricesomething to fool around with but dont expect a lotthe case they come in sucks badif you want to see if you should invest real money into a good set but are not sure if you should or not  buy these and consider it your practice close up filtersif all goes well dump these and get some good oneslots of distortion
much better off using macro rings
i am glad these were cheap  for some reason the mm wereh cheaper than the other sizes and i bought rings to step up or downearly on in my photography i thought these were cool so i purchased them
after playing around with them for about  minutes i really wasnt happy with what you could do with these
i guess if you did a lot of macro photography you may find these helpful
i decided to keep them around to see if ill find use for them but i have pulled them out since the day they arrivedi bought this primarily to protect my zoom lens for my canon xti slr
it threads on easily and offers fine protection
as far as being a haze filter i feel that my pictures often have too much of a blue cast to them and i have to color correct in post production
you get what you pay for so as a lens protector this does the jobive used this filter with mycanon ef mm f usm standard  medium telephoto lens for canon slr camerasand love it
however i recently bought one to protect the lens of my newcanon ef mm f wide angle lens for canon slr camerasand it didnt fit properly
the lens is so rounded that when you put this filter on the filter actually touches the lens
it creates a spot about mm in diameter in the middle of the lensfilter
i had to buy a more expensive filter that was thinner in order to work with the lensi bought this after reviewing a review site probably the reason why most people buy it
it does cut the glare but in terms of general purpose use i shoot a lot of outdoor event photography and i get tons of flare from this filter
if you shoot a lot of outdoor where direct light sources may be an issue get high quality multicoated filters
i will be returning this product as it does not fulfill my needsoverall this filter works ok in protecting my olympus mzuiko mm f pancake lens especially in controlled lighting
however it did actually introduce flare in some of my night shots against fluorescent or neon lighting which is very hard to correct in post processingi am adding a link in the comments to show you this effect
my lens without the filter works better for night photographylike i said if you just wanted something to cover and protect your lens this will do its job
however if i had to redo it all over again id go for something like bw especially if i had an l lensthis uv filter works well at protecting the front element of my lens
as is the case with most less expensive uv filters this filter is prone to light refraction depending on the angle you are shooting with the sun or lights
in those situations i tend to remove this filter for cleaner images tiffen has been in the filter business for as long as i can remember and they make a good product for the money
their typical filter has better quality glass than most camera store off brand filters
not nearly as good as a nikon or canon branded filter some of which are built by tiffen but to a better specification using better coatings
all that said if you are just looking for basic uv function or lens protection from the this filter it is just fine as long as you dont have an ultra wide angle zoom or ulta wide angle lens as this filter does vignette on my nikon mm lens
there is a newer filter made especially for ultra wide angle lenses that has a reduced ring sidewall thickness
it is naturally priced at double the price of this filter go figure huhthis came free when i purchasednikon mm fg afs dx lens for nikon digital slr camerasfrom amazon
it did not have the best reviews so i purchased asigma dg mm multicoated uv filterto go on the lens primarilyi have put this on the lens a few times to see what i thought and it definitely reflects light when its coming from a shallow angle more leading to more flares and ghosts
i plan to keep this as a backup for the sigma filter in case i break or horribly scratch that one itll work in a bindi would not recommend buying this filter  spend a few more dollars and get one that wont end up annoying you when you look at the picturesgood fit on my sony hdrsr and well packaged by manufacturer
polarization seems adequate but not impressively so
would be nice if it shipped with a lens cap to prevent accidental handling contact
decent filter for the pricei use it as a protector for the lens itself
it fits fine and takes a snapon cap securely
if i wanted more versatility i would order the filter pack which i have for other lensesits important to protect your lens from scratches and dust and such
it does that obviously wellbut when held up against light it leaves a horrible apparition
ruined some of my photos with this streak of cyan
but for a cheap filter this is your buy
for an actual filter i would spring more moneyi have a uv filter on each of my dslr lenses to protect them from dust and scratches
the tiffen one is ok but i prefer the hoya filter for the superior build and glassthis filter has a very thick lens and itlooks cheap compare to hoya standard coat filter
it can protect your lens but it will not reduce interal reflection
buy hoya standard coati bought mm and mm sizes of this filter
the primary reason i bought these filters was to protect my lenses
they do this job quite well
the mm filter fits mynikon mm fg afs dx vr nikkor zoom lensjust fine as does the mm lens on mynikon mm fg ed if afs vr nikkor zoom lens for nikon digital slr camerasthe botching however comes whenever i have this filter on my camera which is almost all the time and i try to shoot toward the sun which is occasionally
whenever the sun is in or nearly in the frame this filter produces an annoying greenish spot to appear on the image
i suppose i could continue to use this filter and i will for the time being until i get around to replacing it but i will have to photoshop those annoying greenish spots out of my images until then starsi ended up going to zurich with this new lens
the filter came with it
i noticed that i kept seeing orbs in the view  i finally had to remove the filter to get the shot orb free
it felt like there was a coating but i think it was just dirty  i mean it had something on it and i ended up needing to use a wet cleaner to get it cleaned
anyway i had some beautiful shots trashed because of the reflections coming off the filter when hit with night lighting
i have not yet tried at night with lights to see if i fix it  other than that i cant say much about a uv lensi have this on my mm
it does protect it and i feel safe from dust particles
biggest problem is that when i take photos with light source in the frame it shows some glare like windows do
it sometimes shows a upside down reflection of the closest light source
please check out the image of where the lady is taking the photo in the living room
you see the lamp upside down in a reflection
that is from the filterthe information section for this is a bit messed up and hard to read but youll see that other versions are available for this uv filterthis one is not a multicoated version at this price but does work to reduce the danger of damage to your camera lenshere is what they are trying to tell us about the various versions in the description areauv filter standard uv most popular protection filteruv mc  multi coated for extra flare protectionuv warm  combines uv with tiffens  warming filterhaze   absorbs  of uv lighthaze  absorbs  of uv lighthaze absorbs  of uv lighthaze absorbs  of uv lighthaze   absorbs almost all uv lightuv wide angle thin  uv filter for use with wide angle lensesi ordered two of these filters for new lenses i was ordering at the same time
when i began to attach the first filter i thought there was something wrong as it would not tighten at first
i discovered that the threads on the filter were minimal almost seemed worn
the second filter actually rattled
the glass is mounted in the filter so poorly that it actually rattles around in the holder
they both function but i feel the hoya filters is what i will stay with from now on
i have always purchased hoyas in the past and never had this type of issue beforei bought this product as a package deal with a nikon lens
obviously i wanted the protection filter to be immediately placed on the lens when it arrived
the lens arrived yesterday and god only knows when our postal service an oxymoron if i ever heard one may get around to delivering the filter that is if the postal person carrying it doesnt think it is too inconvenient to carry
and simply drops it in a trash bini am sure that many reading this will consider my evaluation to be too harsh
so be it but i think that any merchant who values his product and his own reputation so little as to make them depend upon our postal system doesnt care
for that reason i consider the  stars i have awarded to be excessively tolerant and generousthis is really no better than a generic filter or a piece of glass
it is not multicoated so you can expect flare
its too bad that tiffen even put their name on this
hoya has an inexpensive multicoated uvfilter that only costs slightly more than this so there is really no advantage to this when there are better affordable alternativesgot if for my mm lens to protect itthe fit isnt perfect but it will do its jobno flare on the photosi am comparing this with an multicoated uv filter that is twice the price and the difference is evident
this is not a bad filter by any means but if you have a good lens you owe it to yourself to get a better filter  youll see the differencethis little sucker came dirty from the factory after a deep cleaning about  mins of cleaning it was acceptableuv filters are great for protecting the end of your lens from bumps but from what i have read the uv filter was created for film cameras and is not needed on a digital camera
some will even say that they degrade the image qualityif you need a clear lens to protect your lens or to complete the water resistance of a lens then go ahead and get this filter
otherwise save your money for a polarizerthis filter lasted me a couple of years on my tokina sd mm fif dx lens before the filter inexplicably incurred a chip right inside the frame
not sure what caused it but i am sure it wasnt caused by mishandling that im aware of
i treat my camera gear very gentlythe filter itself is fine
but the package is horrible
it is not air tight and there is no plastic bag to protect the filterso you can image how much dusts can get on it during shipping and handling
actually i had to clean the dusts on the filter by myself before i could use iti just purchased  different sizes mm to mmtiffen mm uv protection filterto replace the old uv filters that ive had on my lenses for some time now
if you read some of the other reviews youll see that some users have experienced  some issues with these lenses
as they are not multicoated its likely you may experience some of the same issues under certain light conditions nothing however that you cant work aroundits much less expensive to put these filters on your lenses than having a lens destroyed by a scratch or pit on the front elementthey came shipped in a convenient and reasonably sturdy plastic cases for storage however two of the cases i received mm cases were cracked and broken
they had to have been shipped that way because they were shipped in a larger box and theres no way the degree of damage could have happened in shipment especially since the box nor any of the other cases were damagedthey filters were not scratched or cracked but the cases are no longer functionali bought this to use as protection for my new nikon  camera lens
i also bought a bw
this one was less than  the price and it seems to work ok
craig sthe only thing this filter is good for is protecting the lens from physical damage dust prints scratches water spots etc
some say that cheap tiffen filters degrade the quality of the images but i havent noticed any degradation
if you want a filter that will actually improve your images do not get this filter go with a circular polarizer or a neutral density filter instead
its better to crack this filter than crack your lensthe item is as described  it was promptly delivered and well packaged  i just dont love tiffen filters
this was handy thats allgreat for overall protection of your lenses  but not multicoated glass so pretty significant problem with ghosting and lens flare when shooting towards a lightif youre a pro youre not looking at this filter but those of us enthusiast and budding hobbyists may not know
this makes for a pretty good filter for protecting your lens but there is a slightly visible loss in light transmission when compared to the much more expensive filters from hoya and bw
for a quick cheap protection filter its pretty good but if you enjoy photgraphy more than the average person spend a bit more on better filters
ijust wanted to warn that this filter on my panasonic mm  lens causes a lot of flare
be aware
ill likely buy a nice bw filter soon to avoid this
with any bright light source there is a noticeable amount of flare
thank goodness with digital you see it before you take the photoive found this to actually hurt in terms of glare as its not coated
i still use it unless i see glare in my videos but in the end ive got to suggest you save up and get a coated filter for uv protection to correct this problemother than that the build quality is solid and it does not distort my images in any way
im using this on a panasonic agaci only gave it a  star rating because it protects my lens other than that it isnt that great
also after dropping it a few inches above the table the lens became very loose and rattles arounda good filter for what i use it fori put on my lens to keep the element from being exposedit works greatdoesnt interfere with the resulting photos protects the lensenough saidgreat price works fine seems sharp but i recently noticed it produces substantial glare when pointed towards bright objects such as a window on an overcast day
oh wellfor the price it was worth getting just to protect my new sigma lens used in various lighting with noe big issues
wish i could afford a better and higher quality lens buti am no progood price for a protective filter the only real issue ive had like many others is the lens flare
if you are shooting near towards a light source it seems to flare frequently but to me its worth having the protectionit does its job quite well
seems to be durable enough to survive a drop onto a hard sharp surface without damage
good product great price
try it if you need a quick replacementreceived filter and it worked fine
was leaving for trip and had to have it
however looked as if it had been usedthe price was very good for what i received
lens arrived on time and was packaged to prevent damage
lens had some white debris on it that was hard to remove it did come off with some elbow grease and a good microfiber clothok  the filter protect the lens but i did  a class where the teacher said that the lens company work put on coatings on the lens to make shoot better  and we put filter on the to protect them 
it ok if you what to protect from sand or dirt  but take some images with out  and check out the  differencethe main reason for purchasing this uv filter was to protect my lens from everyday use
it does the job well
i havent had any ghosts or lens flare issues that other reviewers have stated
if you are looking to protect your lens look no furtheri bought this thinking wow a uv filter for this cheap
awesome
well thats exactly what you get
a cheap uv filter
its build quality is good and doesnt rattle or anything but it has a terrible lens flare problem
this might be just my lens nikon mm vr but when pointed at the slightest light source even the moon it creates a horrible ray of lens flare all the way across the picture
when you take the filter off its gone or reduced significantly
on the other hand this is a cheap filter so you wont be sad if it cracks scratches chips or detonates
its your pickive had good luck with tiffen filters
the mm is one of their cheaper ones and the quality isnt great
the glass rattles in the frame but once i had screwed it onto the lens tightly i mean really tightly then the rattling stopped
its just for protection and ill probably scratch it soon and replace it so if youre like me its fine but if youre looking for something better pay moredespite the manufacturers claim to the contrary if you cant tell the difference when a shot is taken with and without it you will be fine
mostly these are used for protection since their visual effect is nil
tiffen seems to hit the sweet spot  expensive enough to work well but not so cheap as to distort
get one for each of your lensestheres no coating on these tiffen uv filters so you may get lensflare internal reflections etc
it does do a good job at protecting the front element thoughwhen taking mm pictures it was recommended that one of these be on every lens that you usei felt that it would be the same with dlsr so stocked up for my lenses only to find out from tour guides and instructors that the lenses of today have this filter built in
not only that but when used they can cause sun flair okay at times but only if youre wanting it
so they were all removed and are stashed away in my camera drawerthe filter was fine but amazon was selling it with the fujifilm fiepix hs camera which takes mm accessories not mm
i had to return itinitially the retaining ring that holds the glass in place was loose and had to be tightened
it was no problem doing that but it shouldnt have been that way
after two weeks of use the retaining ring loosened againif it does it again it gets a drop of super glue or locktite
other than that i have no complaintsthe filter itself worked just fine clearing out a lot of unwanted haze issues
however i had to replace this one after only a week as the metal frame bent when i was trying to attach a lens to it
i was not using a lot of force to make the attachment in fact the lens went on rather easily
however once i took it off the glass began to rattle in the metal frame and upon closer inspection i saw that the frame had split across a seam
i will use other tiffen filters as the quality to price ratio is very good
i just need to treat them with a little extra care as they may not be designed to have lenses attached to themok well bought these with the thought in mind that i could use them just to protect my lens when i didnt have another filter on
and they work great for that and they arent a bad filter for shooting outdoors but almost the second you move inside you will start getting light flare on your pictures
the only time i didnt get it inside was when i heed my flash
so if all you do is shoot outside maybe its ok but if you ever shoot inside buy a coated lens
you can buy decent coated uv filters for  its worth italright for the money but if youre looking for clarity look for something a little better
its not multicoated so obviously will experience some ghosting and other unwanted byproductsjust a simple protection filter works like it is suppose to how do you rate something that works
it works therethis lens works well and seems to be very good quality
just a note that i neglected to pay attention to whether it was multicoated or not
my next filter will be
it is especially significant on this uv protection filter that i got along with the circular polarizer as i seem to get much more in the way of reflection  sun flares than i think i should be getting
i just ordered a replacement that is multicoated
would have ordered a tiffen mc but couldnt find one onlinefor price is good quality  i try bw and didnt see difference except much higher price for bw
it is basically for dust and scratches protectiondoesnt really provide uv protection
it is more of a lens protector from damage and fingerprints
this filter does give a glare so i took it off and just attach it when im not using iti have used many tiffen filters but this one is of lesser quality than the others i have purchased
ive notice some marked discrepancies in my photos that are not there when i remove this
this is only related to this one tiffen filter and i supposed its because i opted for the cheaper version
i will look at acquiring the more expensive one soonit works with the olympus ep  kit lens pretty much the only mm uv filter i could find on amazon at a low price
the glass quality is ok but the build quality isnt great
the threading on the front isnt smooth and looking at the edges of the glass it doesnt look like its glued or cut perfectly
however this hasnt affect the image quality at alli bought this filter for my canon mm f ii camera lens
the price was right and i thought it would be a good way to protect the lens which this probably does well
and while i am shooting under normal lighting conditions flash or natural the filter stays out of the way but as soon as the lights go down this filter will ruin more photos than i can bear due to an abundance reflective artifacts
if you take a photo of christmas lights for example you will see the lights again in a faint green glow on the opposite side of the photo very annoyingbut thats about it
there is noticeable degrade in picture quality and there are green ghosts for every light source in the image
ehi figured they would be hit or miss for the price
they will make good lens protectors until i get some higher quality multicoated ones
i have on on a pentax dal mm lens and another on a pentax dal mm lens
both with same resultsi bought a few of these last month when i bought my nikon d and lenses actually i bought one but  came free with lens purchasesin terms of build quality and protection they are fine
the filters are made in the usa felt solid and were free from marks
tiffen is a wellknown company and ive found their products to be good generallyhowever after a month of use ive decided to upgrade to better filters
the major problem is that these lack antireflective coatings and will show flare from sunlight flashes and other light sources in your photos
the photography review site lenstip did a review of  uv filters and uncoated uv filters like the tiffen came in last place for light transmission about on par with plain window glass
ive also tried uncoated sunpak and rocketfish filters with similar resultsi decided to go with hoya and marumi multicoated filters based on the lenstip review which rated them much higher
they cost about twice as much as the tiffens but less than bw filters which are x or more
ill update my review once ive had a chance to test the new filters and compare them with the tiffensupdate i tested these against the marumi dhg and the marumi are much more flare resistant
i decided to replace my tiffens with marumi
in terms of image quality nothing beats a bare front element you can see loss of fine detail using any filter but i definitely recommend going with a coated filter over uncoated if you use onegood basic lens protector from tiffen
thou this is much better quality than the uv protection filter from optekaa cheap filter that protects your lens and not a whole lot more
the glares are more prominent than with most multicoated filters
if you can afford it go for a multicoated filter for your lens
hoyabw are worth the extra money paid
when youre willing to pay hundreds for your lenses why not add a fraction of the price to get a quality filteri own a couple of these filters for emergencies but mostly packed away in boxesi returned the tiffen uv filter after comparison with a calumet  mm multicoated uv filter i have
of the two uv filters the tiffen filter had considerably more glare and relection
i think i paid around  for the calumet filter only slightly more money for better quality
doesnt make sense to me to put a mediocre filter in front of a highquality lens in my humble opinionwhen it comes to a filter i guess you get what you pay for its hard to put screw on to the camera lensglad i got the filter for use on a panasonic camera
however when it arrived it had dust on it and i cleaned it with lens cleaner and a soft cloth
it is now covered with fine scratches in whatever coating was on the lens
its still usable i guess just not crystal clearas other reviewers have pointed out and posted pics about this filter gives ghosting sometimes
i got it free with a  lens
at mm with this on it was a terrible image
this worked great on my  though
its nice to have to protect the lens but thats pretty much it unless you have a wide lens
zoom lenses will hate you if you put this on
i dont have a nice filter to compare this to but i have another cheap one to compare it with that doesnt do the ghostingneewer
overall i think its an ok product for the pricethis filter does its job of protecting your lens
price is so cheap you cant really complain although it does cause some odd colored flaring of some sort from time to time a lens hood will help avoid this
if that kind of thing bothers you then you probably should go with a more expensive filter
if you dont really care about that or if you think that kind of thing looks cool like i do then by all means this will do the jobas other reviews have said this is a great filter for protecting your lense and uv filtering  but has lots of ghosting in images in certain situations
if youre looking for basic uv filtering and lense protection this is a good inexpensive choice
but i would recommend you spend abit more and get hoya uv multi coated filterhoya hmc haze uv  filter  uv   mmhoya super hmc haze uv  filter  uv   mmhoya mm hmc multicoated uv glass filter  auvci thought tiffen was a quality company but although the mm filter arrived packaged safely and securely the glass rattles every time its moved or touchedthe lens i want it on is for sneaky photos but theres no sneaking up with this rattletrap attached
it probably does everything else its supposed to but boy is it loud
never thought a filter could do thattiffen mm uv protection filterthe lens is good the only problem is when i try to take it off the camera it sometimes becomes difficult to removei bought a bunch of uv filters to keep my lenses safe but in truth the filters add light noise to many images and ive found that my lens hoods are almost as good at keeping my fingers off the lens as a filter with the additional benefit of shading the lens
my advice unless youre using filters for effect spend your money on a nice lens hood and leave the uv filters for the uninitiatedgood option to protect your lens from dirt salt spray and accidents
despite creating some points of light caused by reflection i recommendgood built quality greate price work fine by itself but it is too thick to stack with other filters without getting dark corners i got this filter to goon my canon  lens and it is ok but not the best filter i have ever used
it serves its purpose of protecting the lens and it doesnt seem to effect picture qualityi buy uv filters for all my lenses to protect the front of the lens from accidents and smudges
this filter was cheap compared to a lot of others out there costing  times as much
i have no basis of comparison but i assume the more expensive filters are cleanerclearer
seems like a shame to put a cheap filter on a fancy lensit defeats the purpose right
on the other hand my photos seem as sharp as i expect
im still mulling this over
i think it makes sense to purchase the inexpensive filters to start and ifwhen i get to the point that i notice or must have better clarity or sharpness ill shell out the  per filter for what purports to be a better quality filter
i have four lensesthats a lot of dough for filtersi can waiti have not used it as i use to be careful not to face the camera towards the direct sunlight
but its good to have one like thisnot an exciting product to rave about
works as expected to protect my lens
i didnt buy it because i thought it would actually help filter uv light and make the iq better
the iq seems fine to me even if this is a single element
i dont have any hoya doublets or others to compare to thoughim an amateur and maybe pros would be more discriminating
im using it on a canon mm is kit lens and it works as intended
threads fine
quality of build is fine
comes in a decent casethe tiffen lens filter is wellmade and protects the cameras lens but hardly any differencestill almost as much bluish tint when taking snow pictures
notice green bubbles when a bright light is overhead but this probably no fault of the filter but rather a reflection by the cameras lens
i dont know what is true here but i would recommend spending more for a multicoated lens filter or use the snow scene on the camera to handle the bluish casti dont recommend this filter unless you are willing to go the inexpensive way of protecting your camera from a potential lensshattering fall and maybe help reduce the risk of damage to the lens if you aim it directly at the sun pardon the suggestionfurthermore vertical bars appear in the viewfinder which could make almost everything in the photo look extremely dark
be glad you diditem was used for canon digital rebel xsi  mp digital slr camera with efs mm needed to take pictures with as little glare as possible unless you  chose to buy a camera worth thousandsbought for under  to put on my canon mm lens
fits snug
metal ring
the filter was dusty out of the package
there were slight splotches on the glass itself in some places as if the coating were coming off
ive not seen that on other filters from tiffen but the pictures i took so far have no inconsistencies that i can tell
i wasnt expecting much for a  filter just something to weather seal my lens and im not disappointed
for the price i cant complain it is what it isreceived the filter as a promo for buying a matching lens
id read the reviews  but thought it would provide reasonable protection for a price free that couldnt be beat
i should have taken the option to apply the purchase price to a better coated filter  but  not having seen the consequences before  how could you really know 
the filter is reasonably well constructed and i did not see any visible flaws in the glass itself
but as noted by others  when shooting just off axis against a bright point source internal reflections will pop up causing noticeable artifactsi shot a photo of an incandescent light one purchased before the bulb ban takes effect in my ceiling fan  at just a slight angle off axis
the reflection of the filament is clearly visible against the dark base of the fan motor
please note that while the image was not selectively retouched  it was downprocessed and center cropped from a much larger raw image
image was shot with a canon d using canons  is at mm f  sec iso  distance  meters
the image is posted as a user photo on the main product page
youll know it when you see it ceiling fan gives it awayconclusion this filter will protect your lens front element and the main reason i got one should decrease the amount of dust sucked into the canon  zoom lens
but  it wont be staying on my camera
while i am not a pro photographer  i just dont want to take the chance of having what might have been an otherwise perfect shot marred by an inadvertent reflection
nuff saidprovides good protection for your glass
you get what you pay for qualitywise
i always make sure to put a filter on my lens the moment i get it and the tiffen does its jobthere is no problem with the filter itself however when i received it it was dirty
i bought this filter new and it wasnt sealed properly and it was dirty
im not returning it i just cleaned it but they need to do a better job when packagingso it works just not what i was expecting out of it from the reviews of you know subtracting glare so i can take photos of water glass and other reflective objects
it does however prevent my camera lens from being crackedthis is a good filter
i have never had a bad tiffen filter by any means
made well glass is clean
people giving this filter  star because its not coated is not fair and just bad reviewing
its not coated so it wont perform as one
if you are on a budget and just need some protection it will suit you finenow its middle of the road hence the  stars
if you have an expensive lens then you are better off with a coated version from hoya sigma or bw
this list is from least cost to best quality
of course better quality is more money but again if you have spent some good money on your lens dont waste it with uncoated filtersthere seems to perpetually be some discussion regarding filters no filters expensive filters cheap filters on and on
well i personally believe in using filters and going with branded but cheapwell maybe not anymoreive personally used a mm tiffen uv protection filter for about  years
i recently purchased a efs  is usm and decided that instead of just buying another mm tiffen id invest in a bw mrc filter and see what all the hype is aboutthis review is not about the physical protective characteristics of the filter no review is done on the mrc coating of the bwthe two filters are physically very similar both are slim filters and both feel very nice in the hand
the bw has brass lettering the filter itself is made from brass while the tiffen is aluminum with enamel lettering
both are very well built
the bw is somewhat better labeled with labels that are less likely to get damaged located on the inside of the filter ring
the tiffen has slightly rougher knurling and i lighter than the bw but the feel of the bw is slightly betterwhen it comes to filters were most concerned about filter flare
i have noticed slightly better color depth on the bw but this is somewhat subjective and easily corrected in postprocessingif you choose to use a filter the bw is worth it
if youre not sure if you want to use a filter i personally will continue to use my bw
while i understand small scratches on my  are minor i value the resale value of my lens and i also work in the rain with sand and accidents happen  you will touch your lens one day
i would personally rather accidentally scratch my filter than my lensadditionally a common cause of scratching is cleaning your lens with a speck of sand under the cloth
this can happen to anyone and again id rather scratch the filter than the lensalso take a look at the images ive uploaded
i have also posted this review with the bwi returned this item because it did not work with the new canon  is stm lens that i purchasedit serves the purpose to protect the lens and i cant see any optical distortion so it is fine for methe tiffen glass looks fine
the glass in the metal ring however is loose and does not exude quality
not sure about reflections with this filter and whether it has any antireflection coatingsalso purchased a quantaray cp filter which i have been using and is great and a hoya neutral density filter that screams precisionthis filter looks good and i have not experienced a shift in color
however the build worries me
the lens is loose in the ring housing so there is a slight rattle when shaken
the lens turns a bit within the ring when cleaning
i had hoped for better coming from a reputable manufacturer like tiffen
otherwise the filter seems fine
i will updated this review if i have anything more to add as i use it morewhat can you say about a filter
what are your expectations  that it be threaded metal and clear glass
they got the threaded metal part perfect the clear glass part is a different story
the filter had a definite used appearance to it
there were finger prints on the glass the case was dirty the foam inside the case wasnt entirely in the casehaving worked in a camera store i know that things go in and out of their boxes so that people can try them for fit etc
usually they are restored to new condition before they are put awayafter a careful cleaning i felt comfortable installing it on my new  lens
it now meets my expectationsim not sure if its only the filter that i received but mine arrived with dust on both sides of the glass and the glass was not sitting tight in the ring its loose slightly movesbut it does the job now so i dont think that ill return itthis one is adequate to protect your lens that is about it
no antiglare coating though
if i had it to do over again i would probably pay the extra money for the nikon version for my  f lens
rjbdo not really need to screen uv with a digital camera but this has saved me having to clean the primary lense with resulting potential for damagei havent noticed much of a difference in my photos with the uv protection filter on or off
i guess mainly i use it as a lens protectori dont understand the difference on having this filter and not having it on at all so this is just because others simply recommend itit fits just as they offer into my canon ef mm lensi may have received a defective one but the glass is loose in between the metal ring holders
it still works and acts as a protector but it is annoying to have the clinking sound of glass if i tilt the filterthe main purpose i bought this lens filter to be honest was to protect my glass
and it does just that
for the price you cant beat it
now comparing this filter to the likes of bw or even some of the higherend hoya well its no where near as good
but ultimately it all depends on your budget and weighing the pros  cons
it does what its supposed to
reduces uv light and protects your actual lens from scratches or worse potential cracksshattered glass if you drop it not that this filter will save your lens from a  foot fall but you get what im sayingoverall im pleased with my purchase and once i upgrade to say some l type lens at that time ill invest in a bw
but for my kit lens this tiffen does the job just fine
and you cant beat the pricei recently purchased this filter as a lens guard
i tried taking a picture of our familys christmas tree
the picture was a mess of smally blurry light spots
im not sure on the exact number but it looked like about  to  blurry lights for each light that was actually on the tree
the ghost lights certainly ruined the picturethe other pictures i took with the lens all turned out fine no noticeable effects
my guess is that the filter only has problems with point light sources
if i could do it over again i would have spent an extra  to get a filter without this problemthere is a reason some filters cost  and others such as this item are less than 
that being said i suppose its about  as good as ones that costs much morepros doesnt rattle will take one for the team so your lens front wont have to can serve well enough until you buy a real filter its available on amazon primefew filters arecons really thick ring twice as thick as others vignetting due to this ring youll likely want better as soon as you can afford itfast service however the nikon lens that it was purchased for and marked for a mm filter it did not fit
didnt go to the trouble of returning it for i have other lenes if i need to replace their uv filter i will have oneso after a weekend at a racetrack in the desert i learned sand gets in everything
it was my second day out with a dslr and was about to just wipe the sand off the lens with my shirt and lucky for me someone stopped me
sand will scratch the glass
they then told me to buy some a couple uv filters for harsh conditions like this if it gets ruined it is only a few bucks vs couple hundred or more for a lensso i took his advice and bought these
now outdoors in bright sunlight taking pictures of animals and cars the pics come out good as far as i can tell
but in low light indoors with things like candles small lamps etc there is lots of ghosting and i guess what could be called hazeso if you need  cheap protection for a day outside when you are going to pass your camera around or have the elements flung at you
these work  ok at best
professional eyes will say they are not much better than a sheet of glass or so i have read in multiple uv filter comparisonsi have now read the articles about how dust grime even small pieces of tape on the front element is hardly noticeable in pictures to most people
so if the pictures need to be nice drop the protective filter concept and use your lens how it was ment to be usedbut when i am out taking k shots at a racetrack in the desert having dirt flung at me from dirt bikes or mud from dirt oval cars i will keep the filter on in daylight
if mud gets on the front it is a quick swap to another uv filter instead of cleaningi carry so yeah you get what you pay for they do protect but just think when it is really needed or notside note  i only have  lenses the mm kit lens that came with my d and a refurbished mm vr that i got for   i really do not need to worry so much about my glass
if i spend big money on a lens and want to protect it i will order the highest quality filters for it
why buy a nice lens if you are going to throw a low cost filter on the front
why not just use a cheap lens thenamazon sent me a defective one
the filter came a little scratched on the rim
returning it to amazon
i am great fan of bw
i thought i would try this since this is cheaper than bw
but looks like i will go back to my bwi bought this filter to protect my lens on my gf
the filter will provide great protection for your lens but photographs will be negatively affected with this filter
shooting into a light source at an angle will affect your pictures
this filter is priced really good but it i was looking for and hoping for something different
the filter also came very dirty with smudges and finger printshey mm uv protection filters are expensive
for a good one you will pay for a good filter what most people pay now for digital point and shoot cameras
when i first saw the prices for a nikon mm uv filter i almost fell over so i bought this
this lens absolutely fits the lens and for the most part is fine
however i later purchased the nikon mm uv lens and held them up to the light against each other and that is where you will see the difference
clearly you get what you pay for
the nikon uv filter was absolutely clear and didnt provide the ghosting that you might get in some shots with the tiffen
this uv protection does the job i have it and i am glad i have it as a back up but especially in photography you get what you pay forfilter is ok for use in protecting the camera lens
ordered a much higher quality uv haze filter from bh via amazon to replace the tiffen
of course the new filter was much more expensivenothing to say here  its a filter and a filter is a filter  it keeps the dust and fingerprints off the lens glass and protects from unwanted flying objects
its a filter ya know 
if you use one which many do not due to i q 
then its good for the pricethis filter came free with my lens purchase and so far has worked well
no problems with my pictures
the sharpness is great and there were no imperfections in the filter that would cause problems
i used it for taking photos of waterfalls and the beach and it worked well to protect the lens from spray
a good all around lens protectori bought this several years ago when i was new to photography and was treating every piece of equipment like a baby
i bought this because it was the cheapest uv filter money could buy and it served its purpose for a while
eventually though i came to the conclusion that cheap filters such as this only detract from your photography
sure it physically protects the lens but it adds artifacts additional glare etc
in the end i decided not to shoot with filters anymore
if you are into landscape photography i would recommend a polarizing filtertook a few photos with this and the uv protection offered was ok but not for landscape pictures
took pictures of red rock mountain in vegas and as my guru photo buddy told me this was not sufficient enoughoverall fitment and size is spot on
but for noobs to photography like me i wouldnt even have known it was the uv filter but the actual photographer mefor the price it is not bad
the glass actually moves within the ring when you shake it
none of my pricier filters do that
i have not taken any flash pictures with it to see if there are any reflectionspurchased these for my nikkor mm f and my nikkor mm f
they are priced well and do exactly what they are meant to do
worth the moneyi bought this for my nikon  telezoomi disappoint with its quality but then i realize this is budget and noncoated filter
however i will stick to  star thought its a budget filterit does good job to protect the front glass of my lens however i prefer to remove during shoot especially it is highly recommended when you shoot in direct sun or against lightthings that i like it screw on lens smooth there was no scratch noise when i apply first time nor gives me feeling of damaging lens thread build quality is nice and the filter thickness is acceptable tried mounting to other mm lens and did not find any vignetting the lens transparency is fairly acceptable as i test on bright and dark background comes is good quality plastic boxfinally i will suggest to go for nc quoted filter i will be buying one for myself soon and promise i will drop review here you get what you pay for if you want quality you may want to consider paying a bit morethere is clear reflection of the filter
i keep it only to protect the lens
do not hope to give any increase of the picture qualitydoes its job of protecting the lens isnt as nice as the hoya hmc but what do you want its half the pricei bought this clear glass filter to protect the lens
you should look into other type of filters for other purpose like polarized filteri liked the bw betterglass is not as clear as bwlooked cheap as it is price but if you just want to protect the lense and have another lense in the same focal lense it would be better to get a cheaper one for a second lense rather than buying x expenseive onesapparently i am spoiled on hoya filters those are cheaper and not as good
they get dirty very easy and somehow dust came between them on some occasion
will buy hoya next timefilter quality seems to be  very good
what seems curious to me is the fact that there is a nice padded case that you can place one of the filters in while not in use
i am familiar with filters of this type that often have small hard plastic cheap cases but they have one for each filterthis is the first time i have encountered  two filters delivered with a case that only holds one at a timeother then the curious case situation the optical quality and build of the filters seems to be what one should expectset that i got came in a somewhat cheap case and has poor anodizing on them
shiny and seemingly worn in some of the threads
at first i thought they had been used but at closer examination they were just poorly finished
the circular polarizer does not turn smoothly again probably due to the poor finish in the threads
i may return them and get something more acceptable such as promasteri read the reviews about the tiffen photo essentials filter kit
i was hesitant to buy it but thought let me try my luck
i bought for  with regular free super saver shipping and i received it just in  days
when i opened the outer box the inside box looked already opened and does not have any seal to it
i carefully opened the box and it has a marketing booklet and the pouch with the filters
i could clearly see dust on all  filters
they do not have finger prints though
so this can be a bad manufacturingqa or stored in a dusty place doubt that though as it was in a box and a pouch  box seems clean or someone used for sometime and returned it
in either case it remains with the manufacturer and the seller to correct the process of how they sell the product
eventually it is the manufacturers brand image that is going to be impacted
as someone already pointed out the filters are highly glossyeven with dirt and highly reflectiveat this point it is only day  since i received the kit and did not get a chance to use them but i am sure in a couple of weeks i will have the review with its picture quality usability and output related reviewyou essentially get what you pay for with these filters
the construction is not fantastic but they do the job well
i was dissapointed to find dust particles on  filterswheres the qc tiffeni will use these on my panasonic fz until i need a replacement which wont be this particular setsome blue stuff came off the glass when i try to clean it
what does this say about the qualityim pretty new to photography and a lot of photographers ive talked to have differing opinions about filters
some swear by them and some dont use them at all
i guess the one real pro to using filters is that they protect your lens from potential damagewhich seems worth it to me
i would rather damage a  filter than a  lens
in my initial order one of the filters actually arrived with a crack in it
as frustrating as it is to get your package only to learn that its damaged i have to admit that amazon makes it very easy to return simply print out label with bar code tape it on to original packaging include original packing slip and mail back and they were quick to get a replacement set out to mei think  dayswhich was without defects
ive used all  filters but couldnt really tell you if they really enhanced any of my shots or notfor example i couldnt really tell if the polarizing filter was really making the blue sky brighterbluer than the photos i took without it
i took some distant photos of the station fire currently raging near my area and i guess it did cut through the smokehaze quite a bit
ive read that multilayered filters are better cuz i dont think these are multilayered
maybe ill try a multilayered filter and see for myselfi bought this kit at the same time i bought mycanon powershot sx hsbecause it was recommended on the product page as commonly being bought together with the camera and because the filter kit was rated above four stars my selfimposed requirement for most amazon purchases
i chose the  mm size because that is what canon says is required for the sx hs
for anyone buying this kit for the canon sx do yourself a favor and get mm filters as they work just as well as the mm and will simply screw onto the end of your camera lensupon opening and inspecting the lens kit i found that that there is no adapter ring included to mount the oversized filters to my camera and they do not simply screw onto the camera lens as im used to with my olympus and fuji cameras
i know that i am at least partly to blame for the misunderstanding and it should not affect my rating of the product itself and im not rating based on this but im sure others have or will make the same mistake i did in buying this kit because it is shown by amazon as being commonly bought together with the sx hsi mostly bought this kit for the clear uv filter as protection for my cameras outer lens and almost never have need for the other filters included in this kit
i inspected the uv filter saw how much light was being reflected from the glass and decided that instead of buying an adapter ring id be better served by returning the kit and buying a higher quality multicoated mm uv filter like the sigma dgthis is a three filter set that is quite cheap
unfortunately it performs that way as well
uv filter is ok although i am pretty sure it is uncoated
it is quite prone to flare
i guess it protects your front element if you are concerned about that but i would take it off if you are shooting into any strong light sourcesthe polarizing filter is pretty weak
it is also quite prone to flare
of course you would hope that with a polarizing filter you arent shooting directly into the sun but if you would you would get some pretty strong flarei havent used the warming filter  dont really see the point when shooting digital easy enough to do that type of effect in post processingall in all if you are compulsive about protecting your front element and want a albeit weak polarizing filter this is probably the deal for you
on the other hand if you want nice filters expect to pay for themthese dont seem especially sticky they work but are hard to position and i worry that if i unstick them to move something they wont restick
they dont claim to be reusable and i get that but they feel more like postit stick than permanent stick corners
ill use the rest of this box but ill look for something else when im out of thesethese are basically as advertiseddescribed clear photo corners designed for invisibly mounting photos on paper
i actually purchased them to mount small illustrations and paintings in a presentation binder i wanted a way to center the artwork on each page without applying anything to the drawingwatercolor itself
i wanted the artwork to stay put but also have the ability to remove it when necessarythese photo corners are mostly invisible when applied correctly but getting them applied is kind of a pain
because the corners are so small the photospaper dont stay anchored in very securely
and because of the design of the corners not every corner fits squarely so from time to time youll get one corner that wants to sit askewi was a little concerned about the application i sort of assumed that the photo corners would just be floating around in the box
but they are actually on a long roll of wax paper backing so application is easy just insert the corner of the photo into the photo corner and lift off the backing
if done right you can just press the photo onto the page you want it adhered on and presto
 its stuck
but the corners like to fall off as you go around each corner which is kind of a painall in all they do the job
but when they run out im going to try another brandthese photo corners arent as easy to use as the old style
you have to put the corner of your photo into the clear photo corner to remove it from the plastic tape its attached to
if the photo corner touches anything it comes off of the photo and sticks to whatever it touched
im trying to transfer photos from a very old falling apart photo album to a new album and these photo corners are making the transfer slow goingi suspect most of the folks writing positive reviews here are using automatic afpoint selection with focus bound to the shutter button
to provide any support this grip needs to hold your hand flush with the camera body
that negates the use of most of the rightside buttons without some serious finger contortionsi have a canon d ii without a battery grip and i use the hatswitch to select af points and the afon button to focus
this is a typical arrangement for professionals and advanced amateurs
for this setup if youre not using a battery grip you dont actually have the bottom of your hand flush with the bottom of the camera
instead the upper half of your hand has at least a halfinch of clearance to give your fingers room to work and the lowerright corner is supported by the fleshy part of the bottom of your palmwith this grip in place pinning my palm to the camera i cant manipulate af even on this fullsize dslr body
itd be even worse with the d or a rebel
i have to pull my hand partly out of the grip and then the grip just dangles doing nothing
the primary benefit is when its properly tight and im not shooting
i dont even have to close my fingers the friction of my palm holds the camerathe build quality is solid as is the tripod mount
its an excellent grip
it just so happens the whole idea of grip is of questionable utility
i use a simple lanyard that i can loop my index finger around
its very secure and allows my hand to maneuver
beltbased systems will provide even more security andi gave this item three stars because it is touted and marked on the package as one size fits all if fits all means it can be installed on the camera then that is accurate
if fits all means it allows you to access the controls then not so much
i tried lots of different strap lengths and several different handholds and couldnt find a way to reach the rear dial or the fourway controls on the camera back
in addition the grips base has a locator tab which interferes with the complete closing of the displaythe grip seems well made but it is not suitable for the lumix gthe shape of this camera means that when you hold the small body your hand sticks out pretty far
this is meant for a camera with a larger body where your hand lays flat on the body
if it is small like the d then you will find this strap is not the best fit to your hand
it will work but it is not a comfortable and secure fit around your hand while actively taking pictures
works well when not in use to securely just hold on to the camera
i ended up putting the neck strap on one side of the camera to hold it securely in case of a drop while actively taking a picture and be able to just hold onto it in the grip when not in use
would only really recommend for a bigger camera body where your hand lays flati started out liking this lens but decided it was just too soft
handholding just didnt produce sharp images like my mm   i am going to get the tamron     it has gotten great reviewsi have bought  of these and three where gifts
the one i got this time must have been some very early model or a different grey market lesser lens
mine will not auto focus on any of my old cannon film cameras or any of my digital canon cameras
i own quite a few so it is the lens and not my cameras
i can use it manually and with the price i paid i will not complain anymorei bought my first dslr a year ago from adorama the canon ti body only and a lens pack which was this lens along with a tamron mm telephoto lens
this lens would be for novices such as i was
indoors it isnt very tack sharp for you need a lot of light
outdoors you can get some decent pictures however you will have to edit them
feel free to spend  to  on this lens
but not much more
because although it may be okay to take casual pictures at the outdoors family get together youll one day need to move on to a better lens
this is a good starter or learner lens
but i suggest doing research on apertures before looking into thisits a  star learners lens
get this if you want to start branching away from a kit lensbut star if applying to any professional or even enthusiast needsthe bokeh is mediocre depth of field is present but not great and the f is subparbut it works well on crop sensor cameras for point and shoot needs
updatei also forgot to mention that the mount is plastic
i had my camera in a book bag not camera bagsadly during a flight to another country the plastic broke very easily
not sure what the warranties on these are but its barely a year old and i will not be back in the states for  months or sobe aware of the plastic mount area that locks onto the camera bodythe picture quality when theres ample lighting was incredibly sharp
in low lighting the lens performed quite slow because its aperture range doesnt open up very wide
overall the pictures were quite nice and cleari was disappointed that this lens is not autofocus compatible with the lower end nikon dslrs such as d d d d etc
i would have to change to a lens with a different type of motor for that function
i know that now and learned from my mistake
since i like to play with manual focus its not that bad but the convenience of af would be nice to have
i did get to try it on a friends camera and the autofocus seems pretty quicki would only recommend this lens because its cheap and image quality is decent
however compared to other lenses the build quality feels like cheap plastic
the aperture is not going to be very forgiving in dim lighting so its mostly useful during day time shootinglens delivers for its price tagyes its true it will not capture front cover national geographic photos nor pocket camera mediocre resultsthe main advantage is the additional zoom range making good for portraits and has some wide angle for those spontaneous group photosthe lens tends to get lost in details at its widest range of mm when is very sunny and focusing to infinity the nikon d meter does not adjusts well on these light conditions
i leave the wide angle nature photos to the  giving better resultsi did some testing at a birthday playground party sunny cloudy day  in sharpness wb to partly cloudy set at zero
i played every now and then with under over exposure  when cloudy and  when very sunny
this lens likes to give very saturated colors so try to leave it on normal not vivid colors or will be super rich reds greensportraits i find this lens does well in this category if the light is right good details tones can be achieved with blurry backgrounds at mm remember to use the lens hood
the lens delivers well on portraits i love it for such a cheap lens colors come out very good
i retouch many photos on elements  and camera raw giving it darker values to shadows and highlights to white areas
good details are revealed by lowering saturation and contrast  with no weird out of focus backgroundsit may be me but i have experienced adjusting the image and quality to medium instead of fine gives better results i guess less is more in this caseclose ups with the built in ittl flash are extremely good details are excellent i found the lens to deliver easy and without any much processing with flash and set on auto piece of cakeoverall very good lens feels sturdy
i have heard bad comments about plastic lens mount but the nikon  is also plastic
i wish the focusing ring was smoother and zoom be linear instead of rotational makes it hard to manual focus on moving objects like sports etc
i recommend this lensthis lens gives a very pro look to your camera especially with the lens hood on
do not worry this lens does not look cheap or in other words it does not look like a  dollar lens
i replaced the tamron lens cap for a nikon one ok well slightly dissapointed with this glass
i was hoping for something a little better but what the description was and what i got i dont think the seller was quite sure what they were selling
it works with my d but no af auto focus function or at least i couldnt get it to autofocus
i was able to manual focus but some pics were not tack sharp
still good glass and cheap too would be better suited for inside work macro mostlyit is really a bargain
the lens is ok it lacks on a better wide angle end poor zoom
the pictures it takes are not professional
but colors sharpness are ok best match for short budgets when you choose pentax k bodydisappointed that these filters are now plastic versus glass
all my old cokin filters are glass
perhaps it was just where i was but this seemed to attract dust where as i have not had that issue with my older filters
still it goes the trick until i can afford a higher quality filter
long term i am concerned with how easily this may scratch
time will tellupdate   i meant do update sooner
i realize now i was mistaken
i looked at my other filters and they are not glass
they too are plastic
however they do have a different feel to them though so i still think the newer filters are less sturdy
but with care they should be fine
still not sure why it seemed to attract so much dust
may have just been a fluke
still it does the trick on a budgeteasy to set uptakes up little spacedoes exactly what you expect it toits not very configurable but thats alrightsadly it throttles my cable connection to a little under half of its real bandwidth so i cant use itwatch out if you use microsofts netmeeting with this
because its a pure nat router you have to enter the ports you want to let through
however microsoft have written net meeting to use random ports so you cant configure the router around this
the only thing to do is switch the router off which leaves you completly unprotected while video conferencing
read up on your firewalls before you buy and find out if they have issues with the internet software you use
i still use it but wish id looked into it a  bit more before buyingi purchased this unit in january to be used with my brand new dell dimension mhz computer
my intent was primarily to make music cds from files taken off of and the like
installation was not too difficult even for myself new to having a pc at home dont do stuff like this at the officemy first couple of cd creating efforts worked well and i was extremely pleased with the product
but then i began having more failed burns than successful ones
the coasters were starting to stack up and i was getting pretty frustrated
i emailed back and forth with hp to help solve the problem
they had me tweak some internal settings to help the unit perform better
i was also told to end task on all other programs except for explorer as well as shutting off my screen saverafter all was said and done things were working wonderfully
i have made many different cdrs of music files directly copied music cds as well as data files
the supplied hp cd writer software works ok but does lack some userfriendly features that one might expect although i understand that there is an upgrade that i can download for freeeven with all the success and fun i have had with the  i have started to have problems again
the last several music cds i have burned from files and direct copies alike have had a problem where no cd player can recognize the first song
skipping past it works to play the rest but this is just silly
it looks like back to emails with hpadvice would be to please have one installed internally if you are buying a new system
i am sure that integration problems would be minimal in comparison
for what it is however the hp unit does the job usually and is pretty sharp looking to bootordered  of the  pack cases
a couple of them were broken but i guess that is to be expected when they are as flimsy as these are and are shipped instead of picked up at the store
they serve their purposethis is the official closeup lens from canon
it will allow you to focus closer much like a macro with your mm diameter lens such as the mm f and can be used on gseries compact cameras with an adapteron the f it allows you to get much closer focus than without it
it is not a macro lens it basically just allows you to focus closeron the gx and g i tried it on both of the cameras had problems in autofocus adapting to having this on the front of them
i got better results without the adapter and just using the built in macro mode stars due to the price
many of the offbrand macro or close up lenses will work just as well unless you are going to be using it all the timei used it at my school once but i did not find it worth the steep price tag
i would reccommend sticking with a cheaper megapixel camera which has the same photo quality though it may lack the bells and whistlesi am saving the film for a special project in june so i cannot give a full review
however the three stars are for my assumption it will work finei was disappointed that the packaging was not the best and was not in the orginal  kodak package that is shown in the picture
perhaps that can be added to the discriptionafter using the ajb for a month i have to say i am quite happy with it i do not keep my fingers crossed anymore and if the new firmware release actually fixes the lack of resume functionality i would dare say it deserves to by a four star gadgetduring the past month i bacame aware of two new issues and a new plus  the ajb using the original installed firmware does not support play resume at power on a standard feature in  of all consumer cd and md players
archos claims this has been fixed in their latest firmware update already available for download
read more at the bottom of the review battery life and battery gauge inconsistency  i have not scientificly tested it nevertheless my feeling is that the battery gauge is nonlinear as well as inconsistent over time as a result it is really hard to tell when it will need to be recharged and you could find youself with a mute player in the middle of the day if you do not keep the batteries almost fully charged when leaving home
since archos warns you from overcharging the batteries and since the supplied charger is not a smart charger see original review below this is an even more annoying problem
 the ajb neatly maps to windows explorer as a new hard drive standard removable storage device class copying songs and other files to and from the ajb is as simple as with any hardfloppy disk in your system
in creative nomad by comparison the jukebox is read protected and you cannot copy songs from the jukebox back to your desktopnotebook systemalso the following url not mine includes some usefull explanations about batteries installation i briefly described in my original reviewi am writing this three days after the unit has arrived
as the title suggests it arrived nonfunctional  when i tried to turn the jukebox  on after a couple of hours of initial battery charge what i got was a blinking backlight and onoff spinning hd id guess this could be what others on the net have referred to as damaged hard driveto be sure this was not a result of low battery voltage i turned the jukebox off and tried again after  hours  no change
to be extrasure i decided to remove the batteries and check their voltage  voltage was fine
after a couple of more battery removal  reinsertion cycles the machine started to work it turn out this was a loose contact issuetroubles arent over yet  after listening to the preloaded music i hooked the jukebox to my pc sw installation went smooth
successful loading of few david bowie albums then  huh
blue screen and write error on drive e it now works after reformatting the jukebox disk i am still keeping my fingers crossedbatteriesthe ajbk came with what turned out to be a set of spare nimh batteries in the box
thats nice but why couldnt the manual say so 
i had to fight the battery doors almost breaking them just to find out that one set of batteries was already installednow to how these doors work  after you release the latch as explained in the manual you have to pull the covers towards you a fine screwdriver is necessary
the manual does not explain this and one may easily think that the doors hinge sideways  the force needed to break it isnt that greati have not tried to run it  hours straight yet from how it baheved so far though i see no reason to suspect it wontpros and cons great concept does work after all
 compact
 good pc software suit
 flimsy construction especially battery compartment
 awkward charging limitation archos warns you not to start chanring before batteries are completely discharged
combined with the fact that batteries cannot be changed wo a screwdriver and that normal alkaline batteries are prohibited this is a big minus
 outdated sparse documentation
 resume on power on with most personal cd and md players today once powered off and on again the player continues playing from the point is has reached when powered off last time
not so in my version  g ajb
when powered on the ajb song navigation always starts from the root directory although quite annoying at times archos say that this is fixed in their latest firmware upate  which i have downloaded but not tried yet kudos to them if it works
the ability to update firmware by simple usb connection is a considerable plus by itselfi bought and have since returned this product
when i opened the box i was initially pleased with the compact size and substantial feeling build quality desptie the somewhat cheesy cosmetics
after charging the batteries overnight i plugged it into my usb port and it installed in a snap
file tranfer was very simple dragging them in explorer via a drive letter and the music match software included was great and intuitive
this is where the pros end
first of all the sound out of the headphone jack is terrible  heavy on midrange and terrible on bass
when adjusting the bass to a higher level heavy distortions appeared
another annoyance was the intermittent loud quotpoppingquot sound that would happen with no warning during playback through the line out or headphone out
i am far too picky about my audio to overlook this design flaw
lastly the blue quotbumpersquot on the outside of the unit have the interesting feature of shutting the power in my unit off when pressured slightly as would possibly happen in a carrying case or briefcase
a product with huge potential but terrible drawbacks at present
i would have rated it a  if i could haveheres the skinny if you own a macintosh buy the ipod its worth the money and in a direct side by side comparison the ipod has better sound output
however if you are stuck with usb this thing does the trick
i have one and have not had any problems with it being delicate
ive even dropped it a few timespros its a hard drive with simple file system navigation so how you lay out your music folders it is how it displays them
when playing it uses the id tags to show the track name information
it uses  nimh rechargeables and can go upwards of  hours with the new mah batteries
in a pinch it can use aa batteries
its fairly small fits in your hand although not in your pocket
it works on pc or mac very very easily
you can just drag your music files over
the newest firmware update is really cool and allows you to create playlists on the fly as well as cueup tracks
this alone shows archos dedication to their product
furthermore they can fairly easily be hacked
i just upgraded mine to a gb drive  wide mm tall rpm format fatcons  not any morethe new firmware release answered all my previous problemsanyway this player is pretty damn cool if you consider the much costlier lower spaced solid state memory or filesystemnightmare the cdbased mpplayers
they dont skip like cds and the sound quality on playback is good
great for the frequent flierthe looks of this device is pleasing to the eye but one shouldnt judge a book by its cover
ive had problems from day one
installation connectivity and more
to put this long story short the hard drive on these babies almost always has problems
a drawback is that the archos  number tech support is disconnected
whats bothersome is that they never respond to emails
i guess theyre going out of business soon
i would not recommend this device no matter how tempting
creative has a nomad jukebox i would go for thati give this device a  stars which rounds up to the philips recorder is a well made well designed unit
the setup with directv could not be better or easier
if you want a tivo or ultimatetv unit stop reading and buy this one
the downside herefirst off something you wont see in other reviews and which you may not care about
we have two tvs one with tivo and one without
they arent that far from each other
the tivo unit runs just slightly behind the signal from the other tv so if you have both going there is a noticeable echo
this is really annoying especially for stuff like baseball or football games where youre likely to have the tv in the kitchen and the living room goingsecond the display menu of shows is glacial
since this unit downloads the schedule in advance it should be lightning quick but it is noticeably slower than the rca settop box it replaced which was worse than the original rca settop i had years agoif youre nearsighted be prepared to get your glasses out
there are more entries shown in the menu good but of course the screen is still the same sizegenerally having used both replay and tivo i prefer replays menus which arent so glitzy and splashy and thus not so intrusivei like my devices to do their jobs and get out of the way but this is a fine unit
the remote is easy to use and works with our obscure nec brand tv
the recorder works perfectly
if you want a tivo get this one
but be aware that a new quottv paradigmquot comes with some odd tradeoffsif youre receiving your local channels through a  satellite oval dish dont buy this unit yet
its onscreen menus will not provide any local programming informationthereby making it necessary to manually record these programs
we record a lot of local shows so this is a real pain
tivo has been aware of the problem for monthsand has not done anything about itim using this as the cd player in my studio with a pioneer vsxd receiver i needed a pioneer dvd changer because the vsxds remote is not a universal and has controls for only a pioneer dvd player so i had to look to find a pioneer dvd changer that was cheep as it is not in my primary systemthe sound quality is good unfortunately it has the typical bright pioneer sound to it although when i had it hooked up to my yamaha receiver the sound went from bright to flatoverall i like it and the video is dang good too had it hooked to my tv for a few daysperhaps you are wondering why if i like it the three starswell half the buttons on the front dont work and at times it refuses to play cdsif your not heavy in to sound this should be a good choicei enjoyed past tense this player right up until two weeks ago
it had a great picture was easy to use and had a lot of nice features
my only complaint was with the remote which had rather tiny buttons and seemed rather cluttered
i often found myself hitting the chapter advance button when i wanted to hit pausei was also using this as a multidisc cd player taking advantage of its random play feature
then suddenly one day it quit playing cds
it still played dvds just fine
it took the local poineer service dealer two weeks to get a repair estimate and it came to more than i paid for the unit in the first place
they said the laser was bad
i told them to junk it and im now shopping anew
the machine was only  months oldthe price was the best at amazon that i could find
i wanted a remote to take pictures with my new e dslr and use it for tripod shots where i do not touch the camera so it will be perfectly still important for very slow shutter speeds
olympus require you to use this remote that was designed for some other product probably a camcorder as only  button works
the  buttons on the lower do nothing
the cameras receiving sensor is on the front so you need to point the remote in front of the camera so you need to make sure your hand is not in the picture
the product is over priced for what it doesif you have a dslr from olympus the only button that works with this remote is the picture button
which is the most important one of course
its worth buying to avoid camera shake while using a tripodthis is a good addition to your kit but i feel the usage range is not impressive
you need this if you want to shoot in bulb mode
dont expect this to work if you want to take family portrait placing you in the middle
also you would not know whether it set the camera onworks as stated
could be cheaper for what it is
one issue with it is that you need to be in front of the camera to use it
limited angle use
would be much better if you could use it from behind the camera
for nighttime longer exposure shots ie
fireworks lighted bridges it works fine because you can click in front of the camera and pull away with no ill effect on the image
good for yourself included family portraits
very small so that it fits in any small pocket in your camera bag but could also be lost easily
not a necessity but not bad to have as an optionive got a pretty complex home lanin fact for a home lan its extraordinarily complex
ive got an outside net hooked to my dsl modem rather than just connecting a gateway box to the modemi serve my domains so i need two dns servers an internal net for private stuff a wireless lan and an isolated net that the wireless lan connects to from which the only thing anybody can reach is the vpn server youve gotta have a vpn if you want to use a wireless lan wep is a joke
and sometime this year or next i expect to run a line out to the office in the garage and put yet another ethernet segment out there
the wlan doesnt really reach out there since lineofsight runs through the roof of the house
with all this stuff i have an extensive collection of spaghetti
my wifes been complaining for a while about how much of a mess there is in the office but in the long run keeping it tidy requires being able to look at a cable and know where its going
hence these cables so that i can colorcode the lan
for a first step i bought a bunch of yellow cables for the internal network
the outside net will be blue the private net for the wlan will be black the longdistance line to the garage will probably be red or somethingand of course since its cat e im ready for gigabit ethernet once the prices of switches come down
heei bought the  cable
it works fine and looks well made except the clip on the jack is a bit too short
when you plug the cable into a port not enough of the clip sticks out so its hard to get a grip
you have to press on the very tip of the clip with your fingernail in order to try and remove it
it can be very frustrating and painful on your finger
the snagless protector part is also pretty stiff which makes it even harder to removei bought this cable because of the cables to go brand as i thought it would be higher quality
but there is no indication anywhere on the cable that it is a cables to go brand
no text or logo at all
i bought another cableriteav  cat network ethernet cable  blue   ftwhen i bought this one and that cable has nice long clips and is very easy to take out and the cabling seems to be the same thickness and qualitymy opinion is to buy whatevers cheaper because at this price the brand doesnt seem to matter
im not really happy with this cable but it works
if you dont need to constantly plug and unplug it then it would be ok but otherwise i would avoid itso i already had case lights and decided to stick these on the back of my tv
one of the strips that i hooked up bought  strips
doesnt seem to want to stick to the bottom of the tv very well
they have fallen off twice now and i am just sick of trying to put them back on
i will attempt again and if they stick i will update this review
i would recommend going with something else unless you need the usb connectionnot much to say they are your standard rj connectors for ppl who know how to crimp their own ethernet cablingdont buy from pc small they ship it in a large box  pounds was the shipping weight
this resulted in excessive charges on my end
otherwise the product is greatfor some reason the computer is not showing the full memory at startup
but it seems to improve performance somei plugged these in and the post went thru the memory test without a problem
i got out my memtest cd and tested each memory stick by itself and these mb cards passed all of the tests both individually and together
even though outdated they still work in older desktop systemsthese are not really high quality but they are really cheap and they work
the paper is thin and boring white and the crease for the flap isnt very effective so you never really end up with a crisp rectangle
if youre giving a gift or trying to impress your bossclient spend more on something else
if all you need is something to keep the dirt off when you make a cddvd for someone this is perfectthese are great if you want to see the front of your cd however the reason for the three stars is because the clear front isnt glued completely at the top and so the cds catches on the top part and hangs up
makes it difficult to drop the cd into the envelope
other than that they were okaythe price is great the quality matches it  not all that great
worked well enough for what i was needing
the plastic cover is cheap and the paper thinit is a large metal box that connects to the upper outlet with a rubber bumper over the lower outlet
unlike many duplex surge protectors there is not way to fasten it to the center screw of the cover for the outlet
there is a metal tab that can be screwed to the top of the tripp lite surge protector and then lip over the plastic cover plate
not a very strong attachment point and more likely to crack or break off the cover plate than to keep the surge protector in placeit is a good surge protector with isolation of the inbound and outbound current
it is a middle tier surge protector that is better than the cheap ones with only a mov chip soldered to the receptacle which once the mov chip blows with a surge will channel more current down the ground line which easily damages electronic equipment
the cheap mov surge suppressors need to have at a minimum a light that lets you know when the mov has blown
the tripp lite isoblock has led lights and if the red one is ever lit then it is time to dump it in the trash and buy a replacement unit as it will increase the chance of a surge damaging any attached equipment
for the highest level of protection equipment needs to be on an isolated ground as with equipment in hospitals where no failure is acceptable
this would certainly be wise to put into place for expensive home entertainment equipment and provides far greater protection at a lower cost than all the repackaged surge protectors sold by the home entertainment industry hucksters for this usei am using this unit to provide some protection for a home furnaces control board from surges from our local utility pge
 i would not use something like this for a computer or expensive television as it is only a simple and relatively crude device
the warranty reflects this as it provides prorated protection and mentions covering only up to the cost of the surge protector so dont buy this thinking that tripp lite will cover a damaged large screen tv or computerfor true protection a dual transformer line conditioner is needed to insure both full surge protection and that line voltages are kept within the limits needed for the attached electronic equipment
only line conditioners like the ones from oneac or special ups devices that provide current from the battery which is in turn constantly being recharged will truly isolate the equipment from the line current coming into the building
only these devices will insure that the minimum voltage needed is being supplied at all times to the attached equipment
sags are more common than surges and can be equally damaging to electronic equipment and surge protectors like the isoblok do nothing when this is occurringin general it is more effective and cheaper to buy a  whole house surge protector and have a licensed electrician attach it in line with the power from the local utility than it is to buy a houseful of individual surge protectors which may or may not protect electronic equipment
a whole house protector also protects the electronics for todays wall ovens and dryers and other appliances which are very expensive to repair and cannot be protected with plugin protectors like the tripp lite isoblok or similar surge protection devicesthis worked as expected if you dont worry about looks
it is a little more bulky but it does work as advertisedwont unless you leave one slot empty as well as one for this to occupy
i got nothing but cool air out of it and hot air out of my ps fan
i think it needs to be designed so the fan is facing down instead of up to suck hot air rising on the card despite direction that processor chip on video is facing in mb
my cards always face downat style case but heat risesthis fan moves air very well
this unit is also very loud
it was louder than tricool mm and mm blue fans
i ended up removing power from the unit because it was louder than the other  fans in my case combined
if you need cooling then this will help to get front to rear airflow added to your case
if you have other case options then i suggest using them firstfor graphic card overheating issues you should add internal fans in the case to move the hot air away from the graphic cardthis can be done by adding a fan to push extra air across the cooling fans of the graphic card
using the pull system of this rear exhaust fan to take away hot air from the card is very inefficient
first task is to cool the card then the second task is to remove the hot air
this fan will remove the hot air from the case
try using a dual mm card slot fan or a fan pointed at the graphics card to push air into your graphic card
i used the vantec card for that purposei have an old laserjet mp and an apple airport express and wanted to get rid of the separate print server box by connecting the printer directly to the router via usb
i bought this cable to do that jobplug this in and it works right away
the cable is recognized by the airport express and printing works perfectlythe problem is that each time i go to print after having not used the printer for a while so it would have been powered off i have to unplug the cable from the router and plug it back inso other than the fact that i have to unplug and replug the usb every so often it worksi hesitate to rate this cable but will give it  starsthe printer is a hp c so its ancient but still worked very well with my old desktopconnected the cable to printer then to usb port
added the printer windows  updated the drivers and i thought it was good to go but i could not get it to print
numerous attempts
the cable may be alright but did not work for me
will be returningtook a bit of finesse to get my hp c printer to work with windows  printer works fine but parallel printer connections went out years agothis feel a solid device from the moment you pick it up
i was sure this is going to work fine
the only issue is that it cannot take the power needed by my combined washerdryer and tends to trip during the dryer function
i have since replaced it with a cheaper surge protection with higher capacity
i have moved this to protect a tv so no issue since theni bought the ft cable to attach to the back of an old dell lcd monitor for a school project
i noticed that the power connector was a bit finicky and i had to wiggle it just right to get it to work
ive not had this issue before with other power cables plugged into this monitor so im forced to assume that its the cable
i thought i had it positioned just right before the start of my presentation but to my embarrassment i had to wiggle it around a bit to get it to work while i was standing in front of the classmaybe it was just my cable but to be on the safe side i wouldnt use this particular cable for anything mission criticaland here we have a high quality universal power distribution module this high quality power distribution module comes in many colors as long as they are blacknot much to say its a very short power cable
i bought it for a printer but it wasnt really long enough for my purposesi dont believe any power cord should be less then  gauge
these  footers are only  gauge but since im only using them for stage lighting they are perfect
would definately not use them for amps or high powered speakersmakes set up easy for lights up on trusses no more extension cords
for the price theyre a bargain
i got  will most likely get  morebut not so much more than the jewel cases
the pros they dont crack and the size is great
con they do seem to have a problem staying latchedi purchased this adapter to connect a decadeold hp c inkjet printer to a computer running windows xp
the adapter is plug and play under xp  it was immediately recognized and i could send a straight text document to the c
however not all applications would print properly
googled issues with usb to parallel printer adaptors and found what i thought was a solution
under properties for my printer i selected the ports tab then checked selected these three items usb vitual printer port lpt printer port and enable printer pooling
this seemed to solve the problem for some old legacy applications that i assume will only print to a lpt port
however problems with format of the output persisted sometimes the output would print cleanly and other times the format was scrambled distorted text and text split between multiple pages in a random fashion
this random behavior also occurred when printing a web page or a spread sheet
at this point i returned this product because it clearly wasnt working reliably in my configurationi bought two of these three years ago
they had all the right features for my application
one is still going strong
the other failed six months ago
its true that it was operating under a significant load but  it wasnt tripping the reset
i tried the reset but no go  the switch was apparently burned out
im going to buy another as a replacement hoping it was just a oneofakind problemnice but would be nice if you could remove the screw terminals
have some male cables that have female screw terminals as well and the plugs do not mate well as a result
removing the terminals is not an option as they are holding the jacket of the plug onthis product did not work for me
i should have done more research before buying it
i had a serial cable with a male end and a connector with a male end  so naturally i assumed a gender changer would work
however what i actually needed was a null modem cable
just do your research on what kind of device you are connecting to and whether you need a null modem or just a gender changer it is a component that is necessary in situations
it works and at a lower cost than youll find most places
it is hard to say much more about such items
solid quality
it works the way it shouldtoday you seem to needs these kind of cords less and less but if you need this configuration here it isthe cord works fine
no problems
cord does look old might have been used once beforethe description says that it includes hardware for rack mounting
it does not
it doesnt have any screw holes or any method to be mounted at all
i had to rig up some tie wraps to get it to hang on my workbench but it does what i need it to doi was hoping to shorten the cord by opening the power strip and redoing the internal connections but there was some heavy soldering involved in the internal connections
just have to cut the cablereason for  stars is only because the  clips provided to hold it on the way do not do a good enough job
since i mounted it over a workbench there are times when i remove cables and now its getting pulled out of a clip
i will have to figure another way of holding it in placelike others have noted mine came with no mounting hardware
it says in description it is wallmountable and the instructions refer to the mounts but none were included
it is not possible to easily mount this without their hardware
i have sent mine back for a return really hoping the replacement has the hardware included otherwise it too will be going back update  the replacement came very quickly thanks to amazon prime
it did include wallmount hardware so i now have what i need
upped the rating to  as the unit is good but do be aware if you order you may or may not get the wallmount hardware includedthe description of this power strip is poor and the photo is such low resolution that you cant tell what direction the outlets are facing
i was expecting to mount the bar vertically but have the outlets facing sideways so that large transformer bricks dont block two outlets
unfortunately the outlets are aligned with the bar so you end up using two outlets for every transformer brick
since it has  outlets that hasnt been a problem yet
more spacing between the outlets so that bricks dont take up two outlets would have been betteri got this to install behind my workbench
it was shipped in its own box without any extra packaging but this was just fine since its not a fragile item
inside the box i found the power strip of course as well as some mounting hardware two brackets and some screwswashers some protective covers and some literature
the power strip has long grooves along the edges and the brackets can snap into these anywhere along the length
i dont really care for the way these brackets create a gap between the power strip and the wall behindthe reason for my star rating has much more to do with the feel of this unit
its just not as sturdy as id have preferred
i realize a sturdier unit would be more expensive though
the outlets are a bit too tight so a fair bit of pressure has to be used to insert plugs
then when unplugging the whole strip flexes and the plastic part of the outlet feels like its going to pop out
i may end up gluing the whole length of the power strip to the wall instead of relying on just the two included bracketsif i could find a better quality strip for an extra  id do that instead of this one
im not returning this one though
it does the jobi bought this to mount under my office desk so that i could plug all my computer hardware in and other misc
stuff
i previously had two different smaller strip plugs laying on the floor and it looked horrible and made it impossible to vacuum
this strip plug handles all my gadgets and leaves me  empty sockets for more stuffprosprice
the local big box hardware stores sell similar strip plugs but at a much higher pricelooks
this is a sleek and good looking power stripcord
this strip plug has a very long cord and easily reaches from my desk to the wall outletpower switch
i like that the power switch is covered so it is not accidentally turned offconsmounting
i assumed there would be mounting holes on the back of the power strip  but there isnt
actually there is nothing on this power strip to aid in mounting it
i ended up using  worth of industrial velcro to mount mine under my deskplug placement
i really wish the outlets themselves were rotated  degrees
as they are now a large block style plug could obstruct the next outlet
turning them sideways would keep this from happeningpower switch
while i like having a covered power switch the latch faces an outlet and makes it very difficult to unlatch the cover without unplugging the outlet closest to the coveroveral all im very happy but adding mounting holes on the back placing the power button cover latch on the opposite side and rotating the plugs themselves would make it a star product and keep it better than the competitioni purchased two of these and while the one is still working well the cable i connected to my gaming pc has died within a month of purchase
for the price the cable is not worth returning id rather just put my own together
the point of buying these was to save a little time however it seems i was only  successful
id say your results are going to be hit or miss with tripp litei want to warn everyone that the microphone that you receive may be different color than what is shown on the website
i ordered two of these microphones on two separate occasions and both of the microphones were grey and both had black holders
the microphones are shown as black with black holders on the website
if aesthetics dont matter to you then it shouldnt be a problem
personally i was annoyed because i wanted the black ones so that they wouldnt be so visible when im looking at my computer monitor where they are attachedotherwise they seem to function ok  i use mine for gaming
at a distance of   feet from my mouth i was told i sounded faint
bringing the mic closer to about  feet solved the problem
im not an expert on microphones but  feet seems like a short distance for comfortably using the mic
thats definitely a short distance when video chatting
when i skyped on my laptop with builtin microphone i could be  feet away without a problemone good thing about the microphone is that it has a long cable
im easily able to place it anywhere on my workstation without having to worry about cord lengthoverall i cant complain too much
the product is super cheap and it works to serves my very basic needsworks as advertized
its a mic and it picks up soundsmall compact and easy to usewell worth the moneyi have lots of digicams and ive actually only used this ac power supply a couple of times
once i discovered the wonders of external card readers for downloading images into my pc eg
sandisk viking i never again needed one of these
the exception would be if you want to do a lot of reviewing of your digipics on a tvmonitor in that case you would find this an absolute necessityadvertised as pin male connector
photo shows pin male connector
product is actually pin male connectori imagine this works fine if all you need is pins
but if you need  its uselessi have had this unit for many years so i dont know if the current version still has this problem but the one i have isnt silent
when my pc is plugged into it there is audible coil whine coming from the isobar
there is also coil whine coming from the pc power supply but the isobar is actually louder
most people wouldnt pay attention to this but i spent money to make my pc quiet for podcasting and this was an unexpected disappointment from the isobaronce again i dont know if the current model still has this issue but mine looks exactly like the one in the picthis was my th isobar surge protector
first one with coax protection which i am not using
already have coax protection at entertainment power center
warning  if already have coax surge protection inline to tv already then dont connect this also
multiple coax surge protectors affect the signal and can cause dvrs to get scrambledas a power distribution center the surge protector works fine
it appears to be a robust device however i hope i never have to test its capabilitiesplease watch the most helpful video for a thorough and helpful review
you might have some questions answered such as why does the sound only work on one speaker
its a monomic
you need the correct adapter to produce a stereo recordingplayback
i dont have a great audio system nor am i an audiophile hence the title
the recordings ive use with this microphone are clean without hum whine or static
one review said it doesnt bend which was annoying cause it looks like it did
i dont find the adjustability annoying at all
i like the snap in ball joint that the microphone has
it allows for an insane amount of angles an positions
set it at your preferred angle and let go
it will hold that angle
the base is very light but i placed it a nearly vertical angle and then at an angle past horizontal and the base stayed where it was
i understand this is a flimsy model and i treat it with care meaning i adjust it with the ball joint and not with the tip of the microphone
it comes in a plastic bag containing  pieces
the microphone with the detachable ball joint attached and the base
i cant say anything good about the packaging
do to the very fragile nature of the item i expected more
this was mailed in a lightweight bubble mailer bag from beach audio
the microphone is unidirectional
this means that you need to speak into the front of the microphone
this helps to block background noise but for basic chatting on the internet or for recording for sites such as librivoxorg this is a perfect microphone
i agree with another review that suggests a windscreen
this would also help with splosivess
edit after i underestimated this microphone i set it at a correct distance and there were zero issues with popping ps or other wind related issues
i only use this indoors
i cant speak to what the wind would do
if all you do is press record and expect perfect playback without static you will probably be disappointed
my initial recordings were dirty with some static but with a few adjustments including acoustic echo cancellation and noise suppression the recordings were clean
some microphones are so sensitive mouse clicks come through with annoying clarity
i have an old school dell ball mouse so the clicks arent quiet by anystretch but the unidirectional nature of the microphone allows me to click without worrying
i can also record with it at a comfortable distance from my mouth which is a bit over  foot away
once again some audio adjustments may be necessary prior to hitting the record buttoni really needed a remote cable release i use for my e and this is a wellmade device
its total length is   its only a momentary switch for cryingoutloud
if i could find the cable end that would fit in the camera i would make one myself
unfortunately you have to pay the price since you cant find these specialty items at a walmart
if you want a really sharp triggering device consider a pclix
i us it for timelapse and remote triggering
google itthe fan is small easy to install and takes up only one slot
the fan is very cheaply made the metal slot came off when i took it out of the package but it does the job and adds a bit more air circulation in my pc
the fan is definitely noisy when it is runningthere may be better options but if you really need that much cooling a new case or case fans are a better optionill keep this short and to the point
this fan is cheap and will move a lot of air and for some people that is great
however it is noticeably loud
if your computer already has a lot of fans then this probably wont bother you
however if you are used to your computer being quite and just wanted to add extra ventilation then spend the extra money and get a more expensive fan that will not be so noisybought it on a whim quite a powerful unit but did not receive the unit advertised kinda a bummer
sucks hot air from the case and shoots it out the back small fan makes it lackingdont be fooled by its name its does not blow air out like a hair dryer but it is usefulli did not use it in a pci slot instead i istalled it on the front of the pc on top of my hdds did requier some modification to the pc case works good and not too noisythis cooler was ok
it added a small bit of noise but did measurably improve airflow
it just died on me after  months of use which is not bad i supposeafter getting this i realized there is no space for it next to my graphics card  it fights really tight but i dont think its doing much goodi tried to install this in my asus
it would not fit in the expansion port
it was loose and keep slipping out
i build pcs for a living and i know a good product when i see it
i give a  star because they refunded me fast with no return
i do not recommend this productinstallation is a breeze pun intended
remove a free expansion slot and install it
mine is beneath my video card so it pulls hot air from it and takes it outside caseit lowered my video card temps from at idle by  c lowered load temps while playing games by  cit is on the noisy side thats why just  stars
i have x mm fans plus a mm cpu fan and this fan is easily the loudest
not unbearable but noticable
i only use it in when expecting system to be under a load for extended period of timethe price was right for  bucks with free shipping so for me even with the added noise it was worth itthis blower uses a turbine instead of fan blades a novel idea
i installed the blower with my pc lying on its side with the thin side of the blower facing up
however when i placed the case upright the unit began emitting a dreadful noisei kept changing the orientation of the case  upright noisy on its side quiet
so i removed the blower and noticed that when i pressed the rear label the noise stopped
i removed the label and discovered that the blower rattles unless its shaft is pressed inevidently the label wasnt seated firmly and therefore wasnt pressing hard enough on the shaft
gravity did the rest
i solved the problem by cutting a piece of tin the same size as the label and gluing it over the area surrounding the shaft with contact cementthe blower comes with two molex sockets which is fine if you have compatible plugs in your pc
i dont
one of my other fans a vantec stealth came with two molex and two threepin connectors which facilitated installation
why dont all fanmakers include two types of connectorsas far as the fans functionality it ejects a fair amount of hot air enough to cause a degree f drop in temperature at the graphics card
i give this blower   stars  less one star for what i consider a design defect and half a star for not including alternative connectorsim extremely upset at the moment so please excuse me if my review is a little harsh
i was looking for a blower for my computer to help exhaust the hot air from video card i have a thor v with two geforce gtx s
when my antec cyclone blower arrived i installed it with no problem it was very simple and easy to install
once it was all plugged in and ready to go i sealed up my case and plugged everything back in
i hit the power button and thats when everything took a turn for the worst
i suddenly heard a loud spooling up noise kind of like what you hear when your in an airplane
the noise began to get louder and louder and suddenly i was hit with such force that i was thrown into the wall behind me
i was sitting behind the case because i wanted to feel if it was working or not
the noise began to get louder and louder and suddenly i was being pressed against the wall i couldnt move at all i kept thinking to myself that this is what the astronauts must go through at space camp
it felt like i was on the graviton at the fair
suddenly the spooling noise kicked up a notch and i was instantly hit with what the national weather service called hurricane  level force winds
which according to them is anywhere from  mph kt
my parrot mr fufu was blown away in his cage my tv was shot out into the clouds and everything around began to crumple
lucky for me my gardener was in the front of the house and when he heard all the commotion in the back he accidentally slammed his shovel a little  harder than normal into the ground and it severed the power line to my house
the blower finally stopped but my house was destroyed and mr fufu was dead
i immediately called antec customer service and after waiting  minutes was able to speak with martha who transferred me to daniela who transferred me to grace who transferred me to the police department who hung up on me
so you can see why i am upset
after posting on some internet forums i found out this could of been due to a faulty unit so i understand
the blower did also lower my gpu temp to c at idle
so it did work in the cooling aspect
overall not a bad product just have someone nearby when turning it on to kill the computer in case you get a faulty unithook this up to a fan controller because you will not want to run this for very long with the amount of noise it makesmoves a decent amount of air which is a bit deceptive for its sizeproduct can be flipped upside depending on where you want this to go in your case some cases have open slots at the top not just pci slotsim using this fan in an older dell machine to cool a gs silent card with the ginormous heat sink
i used the card for a day or two without the fan and it got too hot and locked up on me
i havent had any heat problems since i installed teh fan
it seems to do a good job but its really noisy
i bought the silent card thinking it would cut down on the fan noise but having to use this fan it ended up being just as noisy as a cardmounted fanbought this for my  dell inspiron  desktop
unfortunately it does not have molex connectors
not anywhere
however you can buy a better power supply with all the right plugs or get a  pin sata to molex connector if you dont want to spend the 
if you want to do anything extra with a dell plan on purchasing a new power supplynot the best build quality but it works perfectly for my gpu because the fans are right next to each other making the air go straight out of the caseif you need a bit of air passed over something directly this will do the trick
for its small size it pushs a decent amount of airthis under monitor surge protector is not bad but i guess they just dont make them like they used to
i expected more from tripp lite in terms of materials too much plastic where metal should be used and overall build quality
too pricey for what you getthis unit works as intended but in my opinion has some design flaws all black front panel
the lettering is also in black so unless you shine a flashlight or read braille its very difficult to see the lettering
on the back where the plug are i can understand that it may be a one time deal but for the front
i dont understand why the vendor would put black lettering on a black bezel and expect people to read it no swivel right angle plug
this makes it hard to plug in the wall and have your desk butt up against it
i had to use a flat swivel pig tail to overcome this shortfall modemfax protection
who uses this in now the plugs are very tight next to each other and very difficult to plug in any time of ac brick thats bigger than a standard ac plug
again i had to use a few pig tails to overcome thisalthough tripplite says this is a premium surge supressor the design flaws make it less than premiumthis device was supposed to have emi protection so that the loud buzz  or hum you can get is eliminated
wellnot sothis fan is a spare that is very capable to replace a normal one
it is very unique that it can replace a cpu cooler fani purchased three of these fans hoping that they would be quieter than my cpu and gpu fans
unfortunately this was not the case
i ended up replacing them with three adjustable speed antec fansconnection was immediate
even my ancient win xp already had the necessary driver
it has worked to transfer  mini dv tapes to pc from old sony dvtotape camcorder
price is greatdidnt like the fact that software video studio  by lead technologies had to install  other programs during its install  and it didnt ask first
i drove it around the block and couldnt see where it did much more for me than windows movie maker that comes with windows
i guess mswmm or its successor still does come free with win  etc
the mechanical connection of the black plastic socket holder to the thin card seems vulnerable to me
better not move your laptop with it in place or pull up on the cord very hardthe cord is not very flexible and this could lead to the bending and eventual breaking for the cord so hear again dont move the cable or device on the other end with it plugged inwith those consideratoins i still give it  stars because of the price
when i bought it  and primei purchased this line conditioner because i had trouble running my computer when i had to use a generator during a power outage
the instructions in the manual state that it cant be used with generators that do not provide clean filtered computer grade output
ive looked at a dozen or so generators and none of them have that claim
so what is this thing good forseems to work didnt really give it any challenge but emits an extremely annoying highpitched whine
dont know if its just that one unit or indicative of the design but back it went
i ordered the w to have extra power connect a laser printer in addition to the computer but i only really needed w so i ordered one of those
i already have two of the w tripp lites and they are dead silent i also know they work because during sandy i was running them off my cheap propane generator and the electronics plugged into the tripp lite worked fine while compact fluorescent bulbs running directly off the generator were overheating and burning outi have three of these lc units that have been in use for several years
one of them had a bad switch that burned out after just  years use
i replaced that switch with one i got from radioshack and now  after  more years  the second switch burned out
the other two units are merrily humming along with no issues so ill chalk this one up as a defective unit and still give it  starsi bought this in order to run a gas condensing boiler from a generator
this will not work as described in the instructions included with the unit
the description of the product on amazon didnt indicate this so i had to buy it to figure this out
it probably works well for other appliances but wont work for my applicationmy pointnshoot olympus camera will let you video record for about minutes
i was hoping this would not run the battery down
it does save thebattery but the weight of the wall wart hanging down really puts a strain on thesmall plug that goes into the camera
you had better tape the cable so the miniaturepin does not have any tension on it otherwise you will damage the camerathere isnt a lot of information on this
olympus advises caution on the type of power supply you use on the camedia e
this ps is designed to use with all olympus cameras but when you get the package it explaines that its for all olympus cameras that use aa type batteries
and even that is an afterthought
the original blister pack has aa batteries but its been taped over with the aa label
im sure its a good unit but not for the e
thats the only reason for the  starsthis does the job fine exactly what it should do
but it only saves you a minute of juice while you download your images
if this is important to you you can get a very good card reader for only  that will not only read your cards but any future cards you might have if you get another camera or have a second camera with different media
as of now you can get the san disk  in  reader for  or the  in one for  they hook to your usb
in  should be suffficient for every common card typewhen first plugging it in i noticed a huge ghosting or blur around characters and lines
i tried changing settings around on my monitor and actually after doing a reset and autodetect it managed to get a clearer image but theres still a slight ghosting
it might be fine for some people but the ghosting is worse on antialiased characters as they basically appear with a lot of smoothing around as if a blur was added in photoshopi cannot rate the effectiveness of this and have no idea if this will protect my modem or not as i have not gone thru a thunderstorm with it installedhowever i checked the download speed before and after installationbefore  mbpsafter  mbpsnothing else was changed and after removing the device my rate went back upi live on the distance limit for adsl so others may not experience the same degradationbought this device because ive had lightning knock out equipment on phone lines twice at my cottage
the product is not welldocumented
this devices manufacturer publishes minimal specs and no useful advice on installation eg gauge of ground wire is not specified energy dissipation capacity not stated no indicator whether device is healthy or not
the form factor looks like it will fit inside my telco nid which is important as the telco claims their nid lightning arrestor is properly grounded but lightning surges are clearly getting through and the best place to install a surge suppressor is inside the nidwill update this review after we have some lightning stormsthese are good cds for general us if you plan to overwrite and reuse themi mainly use cds as a preferred and reliable backup system for all my computer files
what i have found is that for music i prefer another brand offered on amazoni love this because the surface design of tdk is clean and simple it is much easier to manipulate your labeling or artworks without much headaches if you choose using cd labeling printouts
some cds have a color or dark design surface that give you trouble if you label things carefully with lots of remarks
many times those dark surface design can come through too when you use the cd labeling over it not so good
cdrws cdrs dvds of tdk i have have an empty surface with light grey line and tiny clean dots pattern on it fyiwhen you buy blank cds you get to do something to label it
i dont have much trouble with tdk blank medias so far burningwise or data loss
however if you dont label much on your media surface then  it does not much matter what it is besides reliablity and price i think should you consider other big brands
i try to migrate all cd data to dvds for fear of data loss and technology shifts over times for better or for worseit put power into my computer
nothing special and the quality doesnt look like much but it does put electricity into stuffi bought this product to take out the popping noise experienced on my pa system 
 on proshelps protect equipmentreduces popping noisedurableconsdid not completely isolate equipment from each otherneutralextra infoi bought this because every time i turned on one of my dj lights i heard a popping noise in my pa system
though it did reduce the popping this doesnt completely solve the problem
other than that i would still recommend the product to others
it helps protect your equipment from spikes and degradeplease rate if this review was helpful to you belowwrite a comment if you have any questionscomments for menicki assume this model does the job it is intended to do but when i hooked it up to my desktop computer and peripherals i found it also emits a hum that is annoying to me at any rate and is louder than the fan noise from my computer
i was informed by a company rep that this hum is normal
its unacceptable to me so i returned the unitgood for blocking sound but they kind of hurt my head
they almost pinch too much and they are quite bulky
guess you cant complain for the price but as a result i dont wear them nearly as much as i thought i wouldthese will stop much background noise but only because they are large and completly smother the ears
they stop so much sound that they are dangerous to use
active noise reduction circuitry reduces the background noise while not inhibiting the safety of the wearerthese are actually huge in comparison to a smaller set of phones that employ noise reduction circuitryi replaced these with igo  city active noise canceling hedphones browngold
they fold up neatly are much smaller and more compatable with airplane travelim a drummer and have been involved with music  in some form or fashion  for more than  years
one of my current gigs involves playing a drumset enclosed within a sound booth
isolation headphones are an absolute necessity in this setting
my old headphones were well worn and i did do a good bit of research for a replacement pair
most pro studio headphones are  and i didnt want to drop that much for them
when i saw the koss qzs read the reviews most of which were good and saw the price forty bucks even  shipped  on ebay i decided to give them a try
well they are rather suitable for my purposes  they do a fair job cutting the background noise  are decently constructed with metal supports rather than the soonbroken plastic used on most of todays headphones  and will probably hold up well
they fit snuggly  perhaps just a bit too snuggly  but again that is desirable for my purposes
i dont want them flying off while im playing
so  they do fill a need for me  and relatively inexpensively compared to most other optionsnow for the bad news  the sound quality from these headphones is mediocre at best and they can be uncomfortable to wear
bass response is very poor  and if you try to accentuate the bass youll get an annoying rattle in both earpieces
since the sound elements cant keep up i really dont believe they would hold up long with boostedbass settings
the treble also seems just a bit clipped id characterize the sound as slightly muddy in general
these are by no means audiophile quality headphones  ive had inexpensive headphones from discount stores that could easily match  and in some cases exceed  the sound quality of the koss qzs
almost all but the smallest heads out there will probably find them too tight and a bit too heavy for prolonged wearing without discomfort
as the amazon description states  these might be ideal for use with racing scanners and metal detectors  but they are by no means for the casual and comfortable listening of musicone thing that seriously disturbs me reading some of the other reviews here is how often these are promoted for use when using power tools and equipment
by no means should you be listening to music  or other audio sources  while operating chainsaws mowers power saws etc
doing such is simply beyond stupid and can be quite dangerous to you  and to those around you
certainly you should make every effort to protect your hearing with passive nonspeaker headphones or earplugs when exposed to loud equipment  but you certainly dont need your attention distracted by musicso  im relatively satisfied with these for my intended purposes studio isolation and they would likely be a tolerable match for metal detectors and even for scanners on race day
however  if you buy them solely to listen to music and expect to have a pleasant and comfortable experience  youre very likely to be very very disappointed and if you plan to use them while operating potentiallydangerous power equipment  you are a complete moroni think my laptop is a pretty normal sized laptop
its a compaq evo nc not sure what the exact size is but the sleeve is about  inches to long and wide
overall though it is great
i just wish it fit my laptop snugly
it would probably work perfectly for laptops that are a little on the large size thoughi owned this unit for about  years and it worked but as mentioned in some of the other reviews it locks up every so often
because there is no reset button easy to access there is a tiny recessed button on on the back we endedup unplugging the unit a lot
eventually the power connection became flakey and the unit began powering down randomly
the software is also not that nicethey released few new features in the firmware and a few releases back they tried to add firewall capability that they yanked out in the next release never to returni replaced it with the smc barricade  port  mbps broadband router which is a superior product see my review for brief comparisonvery easy to set up a ok solution for a home router or maybe a small business where internet access is not a priority
has many features not available or not as well implemented on other routerswitchesport forwarding is limited but enough for most home users
dmz feature is nice and mostly works but with all the port forwarding why you would want to use it is beyond melog incomingoutgoing connections is good enough for most home uses
quality of service qos to set priority level for different network traffic works ok voip can be an issueas with all network equipment this device is a good candidate for your upsthe problem with besfr is i go through a new one every couple years
the older models seem to be more stable and  my  first  port  router is still in service but i do not get that reliability with the newer models
i have had several of the  port dsl routers fail after a year or   as other reviews have mentioned these routers fail in many mysterious ways  you can drop connections or only run mbs or suddenly cant run full duplex one port may work fine one day then stop the nextwhen the box fails unless you have a back up router you no longer can get to the internet or even your own home network
the box is not very reliable over the long termthe speed in delivery and proper packing was offset by the sender not packing the setup cd with the router
i lost four weeks waiting for cisco to ship the cd to meproduct rating support rating  just because i couldnt rate it lowertrying to reach support is a waste of time and when you do all they will tell you to do is take the linksys box out of your network and hard connect to your cable modem there are known problems in the user community that their technical support will not fess up toit is sad because this is a stellar producti got it to work the first time but when i reboot with the card inserted my computer crashes
if i reboot without the card inserted and then insert it after my computer still crashes
the only way i got it to work is to disable the driver put in the card and then enable it
the driver download for xp has a problem
other than this it works alright but the range is not as great as you might thinki would give this unit  stars but for two things
the support stinks and the first one i had suffered complete hardware failure within  hoursthe unit works very well after i replaced it
the monitoring software is excellent and the documentation is very good
no reservation there
the problem is the company itself
after having hardware failure i called the company for support
the number is not toll free
this doesnt bother me as long as i get help quickly
i didnt
i was put on hold for  minutes
when i was finally helped the tech support person said that dlink wouldnt help me unless i owned the unit for  days
until then i had to deal with my retailer
what a pain
it is there product they should take care of it
secondly he stated that the warranty method was for me to send the unit in and they would repair it and then ship it back
i dont think so
that is a useless policy
i would have to buy another unit anyway
i bought the unit online so i did the exchange and received another unit which has worked finein the meantime i bought a linksys card and it worked as well if not better
linksys is not know for their customer support either so i am not sure which is a better route
i dont regret buying this card but i dont think the rest of my wireless roll out will be with dlink equipmentthis was the first dlink pcmia card ive owned and they have both been good performers except they interfere with windows power management features on hp and compaq notebooks
i thought the problem would be solved by buying this newer card but it hasnt
my computer refuses to stay powered on for more than  minutes unattended and frequently when browsing the internet my mouse cursor freezes and the only way out is to hit the power button
i did some online research and it turns out many other hp and compaq laptop users have had the same problem
for some reason these incompatibilities still exist despite dlink knowing about them for some timeagain dlink cards perform well and are a good value but i would not recommend one to an hp or compaq useri needed a card that would help me get a signal from a basement to the second story of a house
this card gave me  out of  on signal strength and in some places didnt get any signal
i read about a lot of cards and ended up getting an orinoco card instead i got this one in a package purchase
the orinoco card is more expensive but it gives me  out of  for signal strength everywhere in my house
if signal strength is a concern for your use or your going for max distance you may have some problems with this cardcaveat emptor or buyer beware
this card is cardbus that means it wont work with  bit pcmcia slots found in older notebooks
if your notebook is cardbus compatible then it works fineafter initially deciding this product was awesome
ive decided to revise my initial estimate
its pretty bad actually but for the price if pretty good
it was one of the best things out  months ago but i wish i waited  month for the sonic blue product
upgradable firmware backlit quick startup time all things this product is missing
ackyes the mp decoding does help a lot
ive used at least  cds worth of tracks and have yet to use half the memory of a cd  meaning long playing times so having a cd player that does run mps as well as it did was very nice
plus it doesnt drain batteries as fast as some players do so you can continue to enjoy your large collection of music in one sitting without carrying around a spare sac of new batteries  just in case
but what did cut down on my playing it time was skipping
sitting down or moving new or old cd skip or antiskip protection it really does skip a lot
after a while i get really aggrevated
so for the functionality it does very well but for the quality id have to say its gotten me to the point of not wanting to put up with the constant skipping for the amount of mps i have on theresince this was my first mp cd player i accepted it but had i known more about mp cd players perhaps things would have been different
nowhere does it say that there is a  song limit per cd
unless the cdrs are burnt carefully according to what memorex thinks best again available only from reviews and not from the manual tracks will skip and often stop playing in the middlethe sound quality is very good though and no problems were encountered when playing audio cdsunlike typical portable cd players we have now entered the age of mp cd players
accommodating standard cds as well as cdrs or cdrws brimming with mp or wav audio files  the memorex mpdcp mpcd player packs high technology into a lowlying music player  giving you beckandcall access to literally hours of music from a single mpencoded cd
but there are other varieties in this new genre of portable cd player technology
i own the rio volt and i find it much more useful and of better quality
this product is very bulky awkward and the buttons are in a bad design
as well the headphone jack does make a hissing noise if listened to closely like the editorial review says
i say spend the extra money
yes this player does offer a  second anti skip and this new feature of playing mps but so does a whole range of other cd players
skip itthis is a good dvd player
it has everything you want even comes with dts at a price you cant beat
im sooo glad i bought this player
its easy to set up and easy to use
a great first dvd player for anyone who is thinking of getting a dvd player
its a great bargin
i wouldnt use it on my hdtv home theater but if you just want something simple that looks great this is the one
havent had any problems with it what can i say i love it
it was coolbig truckfor the price i suppose this is a decent camera
picture quality is reasonably good some of the features are handy
the camera itself is lightweight and easy to use
its really a nice expensive toy for the firsttime digital camera owner or a person uses cameras infreqentlyif youre planning to use the camera more often however you will need to buy a few things to make it worth your while
battery life is about  pictures if youre careful about not using autopreview so get the ac adapter
if you want printablequality pictures the mb card that comes with the camera isnt going to cut it so youll need to buy at least a  meg card
the software that ships with it arcsoft photoimpressionis miserably bad so if you dont already own photoshop or some other program that reads from digital cameras youll probably want to invest in something like thatthe one that really burns me however is that as packaged this camera does not work with windows xp
owing to what they have called a copyright issue hp can not offer xp drivers for free on their web site but will ship them to you a cd for an additional  dollarsi see your point of conserving on battery power but if you turn off the lcd you are gambling with the final quotframingquot of the photo
i tried not using the lcd and after downloading the photos i saw that the pictures had magicly moved to the right and to the bottom a bit
i had to over correct for this and it became a guessing game that i did not enjoy playing
i had seen pictures from my brother that bought the  from hp and i decided to exchange my  for the  camera
now i have never used the lcd and every shot is perfectly framed
i felt like i hit the jackpot
the  is a very good camera for the price but the  is a better value at only  more
 pictures from a single set of eveready titanium batteries
whooohoooif you can get this camera for less than  its worth it
this is a perfect companion for those are new to digital imaging
dont use the lowest quality x  not good for printing
the medium quality x with less compression is best when you resize to x for printing esp
in an under light condition
the best is to use x with the highhest compression  good for printing xquotmb cf wont be enough for anything
get at least mb or mb  rechargeable batterypros  dont need to install the software
just plugin the usb cable and windows will take it as a removable drive
very user friendly
the os of the camera also very easy
my grandma will be able to use it without reading the manual
pros  not battery eater
i wont say its the best but i am quite satisfied
 pics taken with lcd on and transfer all of them with the same battery
not to mention sometimes reviewing the pics taken
pros  in almost totally dark condition with highest setting produce a decent qualitycons  for wink users only all hp digicam wont support cf higher than mb for direct transfer
you need to get a cf reader
i have mb viking and i need a cf reader to download all the pics
no problem with other windows
cons  dont use the digital zoom
its horrible
cons  usb cable is very special  hard to find replacement
cons  in the dark there is no lightbacklight
not easy to control the cama maximum of mb flash can be used on this thing without a card reader
 mb isnt that big
i am a bit teed off because i had to dig this info up
i had purchased a mb sandisk
dont buy more than mb unless you also buy a card reader which will allow you to remove the card from the camera and hook it to your pc like a floopy diski like the quality on this binocularsfirst pair and none other to compare to but is it normal to have double vision
is it adjustable
or is this a defect pair
i really like the build of this binocular
planning to use it for hiking trip in futureneed binoculars with good passthrough and x  x magnification
these fit the billpros x
great magnification and passthrough price is great for the quality of the magnificationcons build quality is pretty bad
very flimsy
lens caps fall right off as many others of mentioned the collimation was off and theres no way to adjust it
had to return and get a replacement
replacement pair was betteri got both sets to do a side by side comparison
while the bushnells are okfor the same money you can get a different level
for some reason the tascos in this power not the little ones are insanely goodquality built bonics
the cons i have that really count against it are the lens caps dont fit even remotely tight and fall off way too easlily
the storage case is kinda on the weak side as wellthese were one of the cheapest decent quality binoculars on here
i figured these would be a nice general purpose pairmy only complaint is that when adjusting the focus it kind of makes a weird sound that makes it sound broken but its not yetthey work okay but i just dont feel i can see that well
they lack clarity
guess i got what i paid fori ordered a bunch of these and  of them turned out to be defective
amazon swapped them out of course
but if you dont have the time to be shipping back and forth consider ordering different binocularsok but very heavy and large
i havent used them much yet but only tried them out on the porch
for hiking or for extended use  id like something much lighter and compactbushnell falcon x wide angle binoculars black is a decent binoculars for the price you payi got this binoculars as a spare for my wife since she did not want an expensive model
it offers an easy focus with its instafocus system
it is much easier to focus than much expensive binoculars
the construction is decent for entry level binoculars
if you drop it and break it buy another
not too much damage on your pocket bookpersonally i was not satisfied with the optical performance it offered not considering the price
it put a lot of strain on my eyes
i experienced some ghosting and flare issues
i also own a more pricier nikon x binoculars
compared to the nikon the light gather ability is not good
if you are above beginner to mid level binocular user skip to hundred dollar range
optical quality is a huge jump
you will realize every extra dollar was worth it
i did not like this binoculars for birding or star gazing primarily because of the stress it caused on my eyesthe bottomline is this binoculars is for kids to play with them and people who just want a pair of  binoculars and may not end up using it muchi was not knowledgeable about the magnification of a binocular
brought it anyways as a beginner
magnifies objects well within say half a milethe feel and handling of these binoculars are ok but the image is not nearly as clear as most
only for very casual usersthis dude is really nice
i use amd k  mhz mb pc win  and the nero works fine
very quiet
my only complaint is sometimes it makes burning error for unknown reason
i use khypermedia cdr
 out of  failed
from this side its quite disappointingmy old cto swore by the original expert mouseall white and replaced them every couple of years as they tended to not last very long
when the new expert mouse pro appeared with scroll bar and quick launch buttons i requested one through my it department
here were my observationspros the best alternative to regular mice period
the biggest and smoothest trackball there is
very easy to use and great on the wrists
 good lookscons very pricey
for what it is i have to imagine that kensington is making a killing on these
the price is too much to bear for me to purchase it personally
given that i spend more hours computing at work than at home its appropriate that i need it at work but not at home
 the scroll wheel is not placed in a convenient spot thus i found myself not even using it
 quick launch buttons
again not very convenient to have to raise your entire hand off of the trackball to push the buttons
 not solid as the original
the original seemed better made and was heftier thus would not move as often as the pro versionsummaryi am all for ergonomics especially for those who make a living at computing
i own a kinesis ergo keyboard which i find invaluable for everyday use
its not great for games but at least it helps me to break my gaming habit   with the right combo of seating monitor placement keyboard and mousing you should be able to effectively avoid rsi
the kensington product is great for that purpose but the cost will be prohibitive for some in some instances
the expert mouse with some modifications and lower price should be the office workers pointing device of choicekensington took way too long to come out with a usb version of their awardwinning trackball and when they did this letdown was the resultthe scrollwheel was an awesome addition  but you need to grow a th finger to use it it should have been on the side for use by the thumbthe  buttons on the top are just fluff a way to boost the price on the mouse while not accomplishing anything beyond a click to your personal bookmarks in your web browser
ptooeyin order to follow suit with the trend of blue and other colored plastics kensington used this bluish plastic ball that has almost no traction whatsoever
you can spin the ball until you hit bone before you can move the cursor
i had to take the beige trackball from my older adb kensington mouse in order to navigate with this thing
still a superior option compared to a standard mouse this was a major letdown from the company that brought the best trackball on earth to mac usersi tried the  right out of the box and found that this lens did not work as well as my  l lens on focusing
it just kept searching then giving an ok before nailing the focus even on a static subject
i dont have this problem with my  which is slower to focus then on my dii but it does work with the metabonesi came upon this lens yesterday june th  and was excited to actually test run an l lens versus my regular canontamron lens and was disappointed
is this what l series is aboutthis day i was out shooting landscape beaches vegetation flowers and dockyard shots where i stumbled upon another photographer having shot similar stuff that day with this  f l so i compared her shots to both my  ef s is canon and my tamron   non isso i used my rebel xs d and shot some similar stuff with the l vs my tamron  here are my findingsthe test contained shots at sunset at a dockyard here in the caribbean in lowlight and almost no light to truly see the grade
in decent light the l was nice and sharpjust a little bit sharper than the  tamron
nothing staggering here but the tamron lens was brighter in colour
l series was solid built felt secure but then i thought it was way too heavy for carrying around on my neck for long periods compared to the light weight  tamron i had carried for almost  hrs in the sun
the daytime shots i had seen from the l  did not jump out or surpassed what i had taken on the  tamron in fact the tamron responded better i terms of colour
it was nice to zoom on the l and the physical lens zoom internally as opposed to the outside plastic extend on the  tamron just as this may be attractive to some with an l lens so it may be equally attractive to see your ordinary lens extend its barrellooks intimidating draws attention
both lenses had similar representations in the low lit pictures in the end though the l was quicker to focus
tamron had better colour still in lowlight
both cameras found it difficult when it came to blurring because of the non is so again camera man technique is importantmy finding unless there is a big difference when choosing lens like is versus non is or desired focal lengths be careful in choosing a lens because of a name or expected performance as opposed to what it really doesyes if i had the cash to waste i would buy an l series lens for every need but even in this case  being non is is somewhat of a challenge and i would prefer an is lens with this focal length  or upwarda good camera person will make an average or lesser lens work well good compositioning contrast colour modes shutter speed etc vs a great lens under an average userthe end product picture is the measure mark not all the features this is extremely important in photography to remember there are too many gimmicks concerning brands and so called improvementswould i buy this l  f not against a  or  is lens of similar picture quality weight is also too heavy and this lens doesnt even stay on the cam that long its range is not very long say  and its not that impressive for the pricebut yes if i wanted a mm only and this was available for less moneythis is a good lens but get the one with the isnow thats an awesome lensthis was my nd l lens that i had to return due to poor image quality
i dont know if there is some big secret to getting a good picture our of these or if i just have bad luck in getting defective ones the st l lens was the  f
i did a side by side apples to apples comparison with this lens and the  is stm lens and the difference in focus clarity colors and contrast was drastic with all the wonderful reviews on the l f the only thing i can figure is that i must have received a defected lens
i did return the lens and i probably will not try another l lens after  bad ones real soon
i do highly recommend both the  is stm and  is stm lens as the iq is amazing on these inexpensive lenses
btw my camera is the ddespite most people giving this lens a fivestar rating i did not see anything overly great about it
six hundred dollars buys you great buildquality a metal mount a real manual focusing ring and a usm motor but in practice this lens didnt perform much better than one of my cheap nikkor mm f zoom lenses
like a few of my photographerfriends pointed out you pay for durability and optical quality and you get those things with this lens
in my opinion you could get just as good results with a generalpurpose zoom lens and this lens is not much faster than a regular zoom lens either
the lens hood wasnt that great either
it does its job but it doesnt stay in place it doesnt lock on
its made of a great material inside though
i am sure most people reviewing this product here are professional photographers
i however am representing the athome amateur photographer on a budget
the quality of the glass may be better but in the end i did not see a four hundred dollar difference considering the cheaper zoom lens was  dollars
i found this lens great for portraiture but it performed basically identically to my cheaper lenses with other subjects like flowersin conclusion you get a little sharper results and much better build quality with this lens
do you get your moneys worth
i do not feel you do
perhaps it would be a wiser decision to save up a lot more and spend your money on the mm fl is lens
i learned my lesson with this lens and am going to stick with cheaper sharper prime lenses
if you are on a budget you should perhaps spend your money differentlyif you want to share an opinion with me you can contact me at nathangrammaticoyahoocom or nathangrammaticohotmailcom
i am not giving canon a bad name i am expressing my opinioni agree with the  star review on the main page
this lens is nice for certain things
ive used it indoor with flash and gotten some good results you have to be at least  feet away from the subject for it to focus its not an awesome indoor lens but you can get it to work if you can get far away from your subject
ive used it outdoors and unless its incredibly sunny or nice out i havent gotten good results
you definitely need a tripod at duskdawn or even if its cloudy at all
and even sometimes if it is literally as bright as it is going to get during the day
i have steady hands and have other lenses that perform much better that are actually slower f speed at the same light settings
im not saying this is a bad lens
but it fits a very specific niche
you need a tripod basically for it to be worth using or incredible lightingflash
i would have been much better off saving up for the f is or at least the f is
the is would definitely help with the amount of light this lens needs for it to work correctly
so overall its a good lens but it doesnt really suit my needs very well
and it might not suit yours unless you plan to use a tripod or there are exceptional lighting conditionsnot bad   i dont use it every day  but it seems to work wellheres another case where it all depends on how you use it and what you expect
personally i like really sharp images
this means i can photograph something that has a lot of detail and examine the corners of the image at     and read whats there
if this sounds like you then this isnt what youre looking for unfortunately neither is the  l but its much closerif you just enjoy taking pictures and want a good walk around lens thats not ridiculously heavy youll love this lensand believe me i envy yousharpness
its reasonably sharp at all apertures except wide open
no big deal since few lenses are great wide open
nothing is blurry at least on an slr with  crop factor but nothing will make you break into a smile at the devastating crispness either
best fstop was between  and  just where it should bechromatic aberration
not great but there is something about digital cameras that makes even the most well corrected lenses show some ca
if you can live with goodnotgreat sharpness the ca shouldnt be a concernbarrel distortion
gracious
the test at photozonede should have prepared me for this but at the mm end this lens is almost in semifisheye territory
soflowers people and landscapes fine
walls windows and anything flat or square not fine
correctable in photoshop but tedious to get just rightconstruction
space age polycarbonate plastic
seems fine to me
from the comments on build quality youd think every doctor on vacation in tahiti was embedded in afghanistan
its a precision item made out of plastic but it looks to me like it will be fine unless dropped
i did notice that dust gets inside but since lenses do not take pictures of themselves this shouldnt affect image quality
dust sure hasnt hurt my ancient view camera lensesfocusing
the ultrasonic motor works flawlessly
fast and silentso thats it
for me the sharpness and barreling were an issue
but its a perfectly usable lens just not a great one
reasonably priced too
while i wait for a spectacular l wide angle zoom im going to get the  macro and probably the  as well
not very convenient i admit but along with the tokina  and my  l i should be in good shapethis sortof does what it says in that it will play the recorded stopcalling meyoujerk

the catch is you have to monitor calls and manually push the button to activate the message when your caller id tells you that the incoming call is from a number that you know  or  suspect  to be a telemarketer slimeball bill collector or other undesirable
for around  including shipping its worth it sometimes just to not have to actually answer the phone or let the unwanted calls ring through to clutter up your voicemailmy mistake
that i ordered a  pk but clicked on wrong item in wish list
will use it but was too pricey for  tapeit is not the greatest tape around but if you still have a vcr these should work fine for youi purchased and used these headphones at work to drown out annoying sounds of other coworkers
for the most part these headphones are very good
i found the clarity in these to be very good and the big ear pieces allow you whole ear to be covered so they do a very good job in drowning out outside noises
i also like the volume control on each ear which allowed me to hear things that are going on around me without having to take the headphones off
the extra long cord also allowed me a lot of freedom to move around while having these on and i was not limited to just facing my computer all daythe only problem i have with these headphones is that they do not last very long
the first ones i purchased lasted around six months before the wire started developing a short in the causing sound to only come out one side of the headphones
i had to wiggle to cord while it was in the jack to squeeze out a little more life out of them before they finally just gave up
i purchased another set a month later and these headphones did the exact same thing in about five months
i will never purchase these headphones again because it is unacceptable that these headphones only last six months or so
at  a pop they are relatively inexpensive however i refuse to spend any kind of money on something that only lasts a few months to begin withive been looking forward to my new philips hps since my last set of jensens jf got destroyed a week ago
ive been so happy with my jensens over the past two years that i wanted to just buy the same pair but theyre been discontinuedi work from home and i spent a lot of time with my headphones on so its important to me to have a pair that sounds good and is comfortable
i guess i got spoiled with my jensensi thought i could find another pair of decent headphones for under 
the jensens were only 
these philips arent nearly so comfortable
the plastic band that goes over your head is softer and more pliable than on most headphones but when it sits right on your head it gets uncomfortable real quick especially since i dont have a lot of hair to cushion it
the jensens had a soft pad attached with elastic that kept the plastic band completely off your head
probably not so durable but much more comfortablethe cord is too shorti cant hook it into the back of my computer and sit in my chair at any comfortable distance as im used to doing
according to the specs the cord is  ft long
long enough for a discman or a laptop probably but not for much else
the jensens supposedly had a six foot cord but it seemed much much longer than the philips and it always allowed me a free range of motion
it also only attached to one ear piece rather than both of them as the philips does which was less constrictivethe ear pads on the philips are alrightnot bad but not good either
could easily get uncomfortable after an hour of useoverall the quality of the philips seems slightly superior to the jensens and i cant see any obvious weaknesses
would probably last a long timethe sound quality in the philips is superiordeeper bass richer sound
i like it
but if i cant stand to have them on my head what good is that
im either sending these back or giving them to my girlfriend to use with her laptopi bought these as a secondary set for my cd player and i was dissapoitned
first of all i got laughed at by everyone at my school because of the foolish way these things look  they look like you are from the planet klingon or whatever  you will look like a geek if you wear these
those into styles should not get these
secondly even for the price these dont deliver the quality id expect
i bought labtec headphones for the same price and the bass response was much greater and the exagerated tone is perfect for anyones tastes
i am bringing these back and spending the extra money to get a sennheiser set  but even those dont beat my  dollar sonys i purchased this card to work with a linksys wireless access point befws v
i have version  of this item which has significant upgrads from the previous cards
the configuration utility in the lower left corner of the xp screen does not work that well
i had to call tech support and go through a series of diagnositics to determine that the correct changes i had made previously were not updating from the configuration software to the card
i had to go directly into the network properties to set up the pass phrase for the encryption change the channel etcthe card actually works quite well once configured im using it right now
i would recommend this product however linksys needs to update the configuration drivers to match all the possible settings
i dont look forward to the day when i have to add additional sites to the listi first purchased the wpc linksys card to run with my linksys wireless router
it worked but the range was not what i had hoped for
the wireless router was upstairs and when i was working downstairs in my family room for reference my house is  sqf the connection many times slowed to a crawl throughput definitely was less than mbs
so i began researching and learned of the linksys wpcv
the kicker is that this is the same but upgraded version of this card
linksys obviously realized their card did not perform as well as competitors thus they came out with wpcv
it is sold for the same price as the older wpc so you really should look for the wpcv card which does have an extended range
there is a lot of confusion about this card
well i brought the wpcv card home and the range was improved
i would guestimate that the wpcv card had about  feet of extended range indoors over the older wpc card
unfortunately after installing the driver for v my computer at times began to freeze
so off to the store i went again
after much research i decided on the netgear ma wireless pc card
i got home and installed the card
it works great
even better than the linksys wpcv card
i was really happy with the range of the wpcv card and would have kept it had it not caused problems with my computer windows  os
still i am glad i returned it and got the netgear ma
the netgear card has a better range than even the wpcv card i would guess about feet more of inside range and absolutely no problems with my windows  os
i now can get access in every single corner of my home
many times you have to find out these things on your own but my advice would be to save yourself the hassle and just buy the nergear ma
and yes the netgear ma works great with my linksys wireless router upstairsi own two wpcs pc cards and a wireless pci with a wap
running on windows  windows  and windows xp
havent had a problem yet with connectivity unless im out of range
i can use it in my two story house but not in every room
had a problem with getting bit wep to work but i finally ironed out the problems
setup was a breeze took maybe  minutes to get it working
havent had a problem with any drivers
had to call linksys tech support to get clarification on whether the wpc would work on an ipaq w pocketpc   their definitive answernope
said i had to get a wcf wireless compact flash
word of advicedont call their tech support email them  the techs doing email are more knowledgeable by farit works great in windows the signal strength was about  even ft away indoors and i still got a consistent mbps out of it
the setup in windows xp was as simple as it is for every other wireless cardthe whole reason i bought the card was because the prism chipset is supported in linux
unfortunately linksys did the underhanded thing and changed it in the v revision without notifying anybody or changing the model number
linksys tech support say they have no plans to release linux drivers either
this is really bad business practise and i hope they change their policiesi bought a linksys wireless ap port switch and it works well
this linksys card works with it also
but after reviewing the reivews for linksys pc ard and netgear pc card i decided to try netgear also
yes netgear does better than linksys
i used to get fair sometimes no singal at upstaires
but with netgear wa its always good connection
i strongly recommend netgear plus linksys ap
as for ap i also tried dlink p
i even tried  of them and none of them worked
it had cost me  hours before i tried the linksys which plug and playso im writing this review from my living room
the linksys wireless router is in my bedroom and despite some considerable distance and walls ive never had a problem with signal strength here in the apartment
im using the card on an hp laptop with windows xp so i had to download the updated windows  drivers from linksys site and ignore the ominous warning messages from windows xp that the card wasnt xp certified
once the drivers were installed no worries and fine performancesetup was flawless using the linksys quick start guide on my hp notebook running windows xp
i am somewhat disappointed with the limited signal as the distance from the wireless access point linksys befws increases within the house
also i have a number of  ghz telephones in my home and every time they ring it causes this wireless card to lose its link with the access point
usually requires manually reconnecting
this happens more often when the signal strength is showing low
when the phones arent ringing this card does perform well
followup  changing the wireless channel solved the ringing phone problemi bought this card to connect to my linksys wireless access pointon the good side the setup in windows xp was the easiest of just about any computer peripheral ive ever bought
setup was basically three steps   turn on computer  insert included cdrom  plug card in
all the drivers installed automatically and i was up and running in about  minuteson the negative side the card seems to delink from my wireless lan occasionaly and usually for no apparent reason  sometimes i think its interference from my  ghz cordless phone but other times the phone is nowhere nearby and the problem still occurs
considering that this is usually happening when the only thing between the card and the access point is  feet and one wall i find this a bit dissapointing
its especially frusterating that it usually takes several attemps using the xp control panel to disable and then reenable the card to reestablish the linkon the good side when the card is working at least within my relatively smallish apartment i never have a problem with the signal strength though i can never stray much more than around  feet from the access pointthe other negative is i bought a linksys wireless usb adapter for my desktop machine
for some reason the usb adapter seemed to seriously degrade the signal strength reaching the laptop
again since these b products are supposed to interoperate even when several are in use on the same lan and especially one would think when theyre all made by linksys anyway i find this to be a bit dissapointinggeneral comments the form factor of the card is nice
its not obtrusive when plugged into the pcmcia slot and only takes up one slot if you have another device that you need but dont use it in combination with a regular ethernet card or you will have problemsinstallation comments as soon as i plugged in the card and put in the cd xp found it and installed the nonxp certified drivers for the card
i then ran the install utility from the cd to get the configuration utility
rebooted expecting it would see my wireless router linksys befws version  without issue but it didnt connect to it saw it existed but wouldnt connectconfiguring it within xp do not rely on the configuration utility to do anything for you
the version of the program that comes on the cd or the one that you can download latest seems to be from january  does not have the same tabs availble as the documentation specifies
most noteably you can not configure anything about the card from this configuration utility which is essential to getting it to work in xpso here is what you have to dogo into your control panel  network connections and open the properties for the wireless card
dont bother trying the view available networks option it does not work from the general tab select configure making sure you have selected your wireless card
select the advanced tab
this is where you can configure the ssid wep passphrase encryption level etc to exactly match your wireless router
i found it easier to set the router first then set the wireless nici changed authentication algoritm to automatic based on wep
i set channel equal to the one on the router
i reset encryption to  after setting this on the router and creating the passphrase and enabling wep
i set network type to infrastructure
ssid to equal that of the router and wep passphrase to equal that of the routervoila the wireless nic instantly found the router and im online
even have vpn available just like a normal nici hope this helps you get it working in xp this device is very tricky to get going but works great afterwards
i use it under windows xp but i had difficulties locating drivers for anything other than windows nt and  when i did finally locate the proper xp drivers they werent quotcertified by microsoftquot which doesnt necessarily mean anything but ive used other similar devices without certified  drivers with problemsever tried looking for this cards drivers on linksyscom
you get a myriad of options not the least of which are drivers for almost every possible os
the only problem is that they all seem to contain documentation and nt drivers onlyeven after driver installation and proper ssi information the card wouldnt link with the router
it took at least an hour and a half of tinkering to get the card and the router to communicate with each otheri forget how i eventually tracked the drivers down but i was able to download and install the quotnonxp certifiedquot drivers and somehow configured the device to connect to the router
its been working great since thenif youre a technically oriented person this card will probably serve you well
but if you prefer outofthebox setup i recommend you stay clear  get something else insteadi used this card with the linksys wireless access point with dsl router
the router was not worth anything
so this card may be great with other compatible access points but its useless with the linksys onei have used the same card in several  different laptops and although all were running windows xp the setup was different every time and the reliability has varied too
it still wont work with my hp omnibook  not at all
 but worked in  seconds in my compaq  go figure
my original review is appended worked and then it quit
i had to call linksys on a sunday at  am wait time was less than  mins and spent  minutes on the phone with them figuring out what was wrong
when we finally tried all the tweaks it was working like a champ
however we did so many things that neither the tech nor i could possibly know which one thing was really the issue was it the firewall setting the dhcp the wepwell never know
anyway in my onestory ranch home a good quality signal fades beyond  feet
when placed right next to the antenna which was how i did the set up speeds approach those of the wired pcs on the network
anyway if setup were easier id give it  starsi have come accustomed to amazons and or linksys claims that its adapters have this unbelieveable signal range from router
with my experience with this linksys wpc wirelessb notbook adapter as well as the linksys wusb wirelessb usb network adapter is that they do not have the  to  ft range as they claim
i get dismal signal strength when i have these adapters over  ft from the router
if i dare to go ft or farther from the router the strength drops to quotpoorquot or just completely drops offone aggravating and costly solution to this problem is to buy the linksys wsb wirelessb signal booster
though this product is not available on amazon i bought mine for a whopping  at circuit city
the furthest successful signal range or get the quotvery goodquot signal readings on my adapters with the  signal booster is about  ft the furthest successful signal range without a booster is about ft
so this product gets  stars for its poor signal range and costly solution to the problemat school there is a wireless network and i always use this card to get on to the network
there are  routers and many places that i have access to wireless
but in some of those places the card cannot keep a steady connection and the only page it will be able to load is google
this happens even when the signal strength is good
i dont know if it is the new apple airports that the school has but im not too satisfied with itive owned this trackball for almost a year now and while ive been generally satisfied with its performance there are some areas that could use improvementfirst ive noticed that it tends to stick alot more than the trackball i owned previously the logitech thumbtrackball
i could actually play fps games with the logitech this one simply isnt responsive enough and needs to be cleaned quite frequently
luckily its quite easy to pop the ball out of the assembly run your finger over the three touch points and pop the ball back in
i have also noticed that there seems to be a rub point just above the optical sensor on mine  im not sure if this is present in all of them thoughthe next issue is the software for the additional buttons
the software sometimes seems to ignore settings for specific programs
i have the far right button set to close program by default but have specific settings for ie firefox and explorer that should make it the forward button
unfortunately it will frequently close the program instead of moving forwardthe unit itself is comfortable
i like the scroll  it doesnt have the hard ratcheting of some mice ive used but you can still feel the click of the stop points
when the extra buttons work as expected theyre extremely usefulone thing to note the software included with this trackball seems to conflict with logitechs mouseware  if you want to use a mouse and trackball my advice would be to get matching brandsproscomfortableextra buttonsconsball tends to stickextra buttons occasionally do not function as intendedi agree with reviewer marek that the ball sticks
my experience is that it seems to stick when it gets warm and must expand a tiny bit so it binds in the housing
wiping it off does not help
curiously what does help is to put it in the freezer for  minutes not always a practical alternativeor just leaving it alone for a while
the click is a little too sensitive as well
barring these  things i would probably buy  or  to keep for spares
it fits my hand well and i like the thumb control definitely something some people need time to get used tothis is an inexpensive trackball to have
it is thumb operated and overall it is useable but not a wow accessory
the ball can be pulled out rather easily and the texture of the mouse lends itself a bit to be slippery
the side buttons are hard to press in the context of working but they are functonal
i find it a little challenging to click and drag with this mouse and with the extra rolliness of the ball but it can be done
i think this is an decent trackball for the price but if you want high performance you should look into getting a trackball exploreri bought the ms trackball explorer about a   years ago
it works well with a couple of major flaws  the cord is far too short if you have a computer desk with the cpu a distance away from the trackball it simply doesnt reach
i have a pullout shelf and the trackball pulls up under it every time i slide it out
 the explorer needs to have secure rubber quotfeetquot to keep it from slipping all over the place on a smooth surface such as veneer
 those who say you dont have to clean this device are in error
sweat from your hand dust etc
form gunk that looks like earwax around the three metal sensors and these have to be cleaned periodically otherwise the trackball wont move the cursor around properly
this was my first trackball so i do assume mechanical ones required far more frequent cleaning than this one doesi average about once a month use my pc about  hours per daybecause of the cord problem i am considering buying a logitech mx  cordless optical mousei just threw away this trackball after around  years of use
more on that laterergonomically this trackball is not as good as the discontinued logitech trackman marble fx but what trackball is
the trackball explorer places your hand in a more horizontal position than the logitechs more naturalneutral positionthe buttons are placed somewhat poorly
any time you have to click both mouse buttons you have to move your thumb forward into an awkward position and i often hit the scroll wheel while trying to click on the right or left mouse button
the thumb simply should not be asked to do that much its not dexterous enough and i have a lot of training in piano my thumb is plenty dexterousthe fourth and fifth buttons are placed well for your fourth and fifth fingers and the trackball itself is within easy reach of your index and middle fingersi know it sounds like im ragging on the design a lot but thats only because im comparing this to my previous trackball the aforementioned logitech
compared to most other trackballs the trackball explorer is quite goodlike most optical trackballs you still needed to clean it occasionally for smooth scrolling but the process is quick and easymy biggest gripe with this product is that the left mouse button broke after only  years of use which is why it is currently sitting in my trash and my old logitech is back on my desktop i abandoned it strictly for not having a scroll wheel its only flawthe left mouse button is attached to the housing by two long plastic tines
one of the tines broke so that getting a click to register became difficult and any clicking inevitably engaged the scroll wheel either clicking it or scrolling things up and down
this resulted in all kinds of odd behavior from the trackball until i took it apart and figured out what went wrongof all the modern trackballs that have not been discontinued are not wireless what the heck is the point of a wireless trackball
and has a scroll wheel this is my favorite but im not sure i want to buy another one since the mouse button broke after only  years
ive never had a mouse button break before
sighwap v was delivered with f firmware newer than the quotlatest official firmwarequot on linksys site c
wanted to turn off broadcast ssid for higher security and wap v could not talk at all to linksys wet at all
called linksys and after waiting more than  minutes to talk to someone im not convinced the tech support guy had ever seen these products or knew what broadcast ssid was
anyway he told me that quotlinksys products required broadcast ssid to be onquot
yeah right
poking around on the internet revealed later firmware j on a linksys site in singapore which worked perfectly on the first try with wep on and broadcast ssid off
so it is working now but i am not impressed with linksys firmware or tech quotsupportquoti purchased the wap along with a card for my laptop and a linksys ethernet bridge
installing the access point was simple
you basically just connect the access point on your wired network and then use the included setup cd to configure the access point
within a couple of minutes of pulling it out of the box it was up and running
i was thrilledunfortunately things went downhill from there
i started to have problems with my wireless network going down
the access point would appear to be up and running i could connect to its internal webserver but neither of my clients could connect
this was usually solved by restarting the access point or the clients or both
doing this on a regular basis wasnt acceptable so i tried a firmware update which btw was very easy to install
after the firmware update the situation got worse
the wireless network was completely nonfunctionalto solve the problem i started to dig in to the configuration of the access point
i had tweaked a couple of settings to make it more secure btw its default settings are very insecure so i tried changing some of these options
after some trial and error i managed to get everything running again  by reenabling ssid broadcast in case you were wondering
since then the network has been rock solidin the end i am happy with the product
it is easy to setup and configure and has been working fine since the initial headachean earlier review below talks about boosting the output power by playing with an undocumented setting
this only works for the old model
the new one wap v is completely different there is no known way to make it output more powerpat  zippy at csbrandeiseduonce upon time there was a coupleoh yes youve heard that story before havent you
well now the couple is happily ensconced in their new home with the unfinished landscaping surrounded by a moat of newly minted mud courtesy of some recent nasty thunderstorms
but inside the house there is plenty of beauty and one of the most beautiful thingsi am happy to reportis the new wireless network centered around linksys equipment ie
the linksys instant wireless access point wap the linksys instant wireless ethernet pc card wpc and the linksys instant wireless pci adapter wdtthis review is focused on the linksys instant wireless wdtthe linksys instant wireless wdt is a pci adapter card which along with the linksys instant wireless ethernet pc card wpc which it houses is designed to bring wireless capabilities to the desktop computerthe wdt by itself is just a housing it has no networking capabilities
only when mated with the wpc as a unit is the card functional
the wdt contains a type ii slot into which the wpc is inserted once the card is installed in the pc
i installed two wdts one in my desktop and the other in spouses desktop without a problem
there is no software to install and the manual details how to install the card in the pc and then how to insert the pc card wpconce i inserted the wpc ethernet card i installed the software drivers which came with the wpc for both and connected to the access point
thats all there is to it
nothing too exciting about this one folks it just works
one quick note about inserting the pc card wpc into the slot provided
pay close attention the way  you insert the card it only goes in one way the manual gives detailed stepbystep instructions for inserting the card the right way so follow them
if the wpc card is inserted wrong it will not worki paid  a piece for my cards on ebay and the going price for the card online and retail is between overall nice product and cheap
but be aware the handles get so hot that it will burn you if you do not use potholderupdate  i took off one star of my original review
i used it last night and today i found out there are some weird stains in and out of the pot and steamer alreadyit is as refined as a swiss watch and it feels very solid but it is far too small
the picture on the website is misleading
it may be enough for a person living alone
if he or she has a family forget this steamer potmy first gps
initially had some trouble with software often crashing locking up the unit
but its works problem free since i updated the software
which i might add is pretty straightforward
the only issue that i have with the unit is that it doesnt track well in densely wooded trails
its performance is spotty
eats batteries so bring extras out on the trail
ive gotten used to it now its helpful not to wear the unit on your belt but rather up on the strap of your backpack
that makes it a little more reliable
originally i picked it up for just for safety and its fine for that
though it doesnt work well enough for mapping purposes it works well enough to save way points for reference
it often looses the signal of satellites behind hills
i hope to replace it soon with a newer high sensitivity unit sooni bought this to take hiking on the many pennsylvania trails
for that purpose it is absolutely useless
it just does not pick up the sattelites when you are under the cover of trees
it wont even work around my house which has many treesi decided to keep it however because i also use it when i walk or bike around the neighborhood and for that it works just fineone minor iritation  it takes quite a while  minutes to pick up the satellites
this is a bit annoying as when i walk outside to start my walk or bike ride i need to stand there and wait for it to pick up the satellitesi recently buried my legend after two years of service
i used it for canoe backpack and motorcycle navigation and for plot relocation
the basic gps is like all etrex units well designed  small lightweight waterproof with an easytouse fairly intuitive user interface
i have often wished apple had hired garmin to write the ipod interface
the gps receiver is pretty good but has been eclipsed by the new sirf receiver used for instance in thegarmin gpsmap cx handheld gps navigator
you should definitely consider a sirf receiver if you will be in cities forests or canyons
the display in the etrex suffers from small size low resolution and being blackandwhite
it adds up to an almost unusable map
this is a manageable drawback no gps will replace a good map because they all have tiny screens in comparison to the average road map and maps are all about organizing spatial data
with the etrex i found that i used the navigation and trip computer screens much more than the map screen
as for  getting data into and out of the etrex its a bit of a headache
the interface is serial which is very slow if youre used to usb devices
the cables cost a fortune  if you buy garmins brand a full set of power and data cables will cost half as much as the gps
most map software these days can communicate with this model garmin but it often takes quite a bit of labor to figure out how
the etrex does work well with the garmin proprietary map packages but those packages were designed for use with more highend units so the etrex doesnt utilize their features as well as it might especially since it only has mb of memory
in comparison the gpsmap c takes up to gb of memory enough to load an entire garmin cd with room to spare
finally my etrex died because the screen stopped working
it happened gradually and occasionally comes back to life if you give it a good knock so it must be a loose connection of some sort
i believe this reflects poor vibration resistance so i cant recommend this unit for motorcycle usei bought mine in  for  and was happy with it but it almost completely fell apart in  first thing to go was one of the battery clips
because this is a bad design the battery clips sometimes get pushed too far in and then your unit starts behaving strangely lots of vertical lines on the lcd or stops working
i had to bend the clips back out too many times and one of them finally broke
this should have springs not clips
second thing to go was the rubber covering on the buttons on the side
this was followed very shortly by the covering on the pushbutton stick
the unit is now not usable and returning it to garmin for repair costs as much as getting a new onei was hoping that by now garmin would come out with a gps unit that did twice what this one could do for half the price but there isnt enough competition apparently
gps chips are a dime a dozen and my samsung cell phone can do more than this unit can do  but the software isnt written for hiking and such so youre stuck until someone comes along and fills this niche and outcompetes garmin and magellan
im still waiting to get another gps to replace this one come on competition
for now ill just use my cell phonei love the unit it works really well
i have never been able to get the  foot advertised accuracy in hawaii but the  foot or so accuracy i usually get works just fine for memy only complain is the plastic loop that the lanyard attachs to is not very strong
the unit needs to see the sky to work so i attach the lanyard that comes with the unit to a plastic loop at the bottom of the unit and hang it around my neck
it works very well when you are walking around
the unit keeps track of your position accurately
however the plastic loop broke off the other day from just one good jerk
i broke the weak plastic loop when i was standing up with the unit hanging around my neck and the unit get caught on the edge of the tablei will send the unit back for repair still under warranty but i am concern that the plastic loop will break off againworked great for me for many years
i really loved that this unit was waterproof
i only gave it  stars because the signal reception was very weak
it would go in and out under the slightest tree cover
i recently cracked the screen on this unit and upgraded to the new etrex models which are of course much better
wasnt the gpss fault but rather mine as i put it in a checked bag at the airportwhen i got the unit it kept shutting off for no reason
im sure it was a fluke but it was frustrating
i was going to exchange it and it realized that for an extra  i could get the vista c which is color has a usb cable and is an all around better unit
the regular vista comes with a serial port cable and i dont have serial ports so i would have needed a  cable
im glad i went with the vista c insteadive used my vista  or  times and its been pretty pampered
unlike some other reviews i found its menus and controls fairly intuitive once i messed around with them a little bit
then just as i decided to start using this for some real geocaching instead of simply day hiking the screen flipped out and failed
now i often just get a bunch of lines across the screens and there is noise on the screen even when i can see what im supposed to
the internal parts seem to be working but the lcd failed very quickly ive had this about  years but with minimal useso hopefully theyll fix the issue since i see the same complaint from othesi bought the etrex really wanting to love it but i didnt
i will try to not rehash everything the other reviewers have said but i will state the issues that i hadthe screen scratched easily and its small not sure if it was just a plastic cover but its messed up right in the middleit was hard to get connected and had issues with cloud coverwith all the funtionality it just wasnt that functional
the book was thick the buttons were confusingi still have it but i dont really use it and that is a shame because i know garmin makes good products but this user just wasnt happy
i will recommend the name but not the productif you want a gps unit for backpacking this one or the newer color version has among the best feature sets
downloadable maps an altimeter an electronic compass etc
its a cadillac unless you step up from the etrex line to something beautiful but horrendously expensive like the gpsmap csx super duper cadillac
however a few things need to be kept in mindfew backpackers should need a gps receiver at all
a map ought to get most people down the trail just fine
a paper map not the expensive propriety software  scale topo maps you can pay extra for to put on this unit its builtin maps are of major roads cities etc
but if you wear the newest patagonia have springloaded trekking poles etc youd best get this expensive doo dad and garmin does overprice all their gear so youll be fashionable outdoors
otherwise think before buying any gps receiver
apart from geocaching i dont see much use for hiking with gps
if you rely on gps to get you around youll learn its entirely insufficient as a substitute for good land navigation skills
learn to read a topo map and figure out where to go without assuming your batteries will last on a device that shows you only where you are and where you want to go but not whats in between
the one and only reason i got this is for off trail use primarily as an emergency backup to make it easier get back to camp and i got a deal on it or i wouldnt have bought it
this gps isnt anything i rely on for my safety since itlike most gps receiverswont maintain a satellite lock in most of the forests and canyons i visit
in hindsight if i were going to buy a gps receiver again id probably just get the cheapest one out there since there isnt much practical use for a backpacking gps receiver apart from showing where you are in relation to a particular waypoint of course if i could afford a rino for each family memberthe altimeter of course is barometric so air pressure changes will affect it even if youre staying in one place
thats not a defect its just the way things work
better than trying to get altitude accuracy from the satellites gps receivers are good at latitude and longitude not altitude which is why this unit has a barometric altimeteryou shouldnt need the electronic compass because you should always have a real one
real ones dont die when the batteries do
and the electronic compass uses more power when its onwith those caveats in mind this unit does about what youd expect and want with one exception as people have said it sometimes shuts off unexpectedly
this is not as a recent reviewer guessed a fluke with his own unit
its a common problem with garmins etrex receivers generally attributed to poor battery contacts but there was also a software glitch that contributes garmin claims they fixed it
itll restart but it shouldnt even happen occasionallyi like my garmin etrex vista
its easy to use seems sturdy and reliablemajor disadvantages   the only way to connect this unit to a computer is via an rs interface old technology
i purchased a nongarmin usbrs converter cable but havent been able to make it work  there is no way to connect the unit to a  volt source read batteries
i jury rigged this by purchasing a cable that connects the unit to a car cigarette lighter also has an rs connection and purchasing a converter  that converts  to  volt with a cigarette lighter output
it worksthe ipaqs are the best pocket pcs to own if your priorities are expansion possibilities and style
the ipaqs are big losers if you want hardware reliability
there are a number of reported problems dust under the screen broken stylus latch busted headphone switch busted digitizer and reversed screen displaythe screen problems apply only to the color ipaqs
in particular the monochrome ipaq does not have the infamous dust under the screen problem
the monochrome ipaqs screen is more reliable but less readable
it isnt the lack of color that causes problems rather it is the lack of brightness
the s screen is best used in two situations very bright lighting where the displays reflective elements provide good contrast or in very low light situations where the weak backlighting is sufficient
in moderate light situations neither the reflective screen nor the backlight offer enough contrast to cut through screen glare
if youve seen those watches with the blue backlighting thats about the level of backlight and color you get with the monochrome ipaq
in bright light the screen is greenish not the nice white color compaq likes to use in ad photosif your priority is small size and you want to use the cf sleeve youre better off with a cassiopeia e because that unit is less thick than an ipaq with the cf sleeve
the ipaq wearing the pcmcia card sleeve is much larger than the e
to play mps or to watch movies using media player  free from microsoft youll likely need a cf memory card for storage so for those applications expect to have that fat sleeve around your ipaqyou must expect a certain amount of flakiness with microsoft windows powered devices
this is still windows after all
you will need to reboot the device soft reset from time to time get out of hangs or to get activesync to start working again
you will also need to reboot your desktop sometimes because activesync will crash it
fair warning
this is not to say the device is so unstable as to be unusable
but pocket pcs are by no means at appliancelevel reliability
you dont worry about your microwave ovens operating system crashing in the middle of cooking a meal
the pocket pc shell strangely lacks a uniform way to close applications
there is no little x in the corner to close an app
compaq has added an application that addresses this
the little q button pops up a window that offers to close the currently active app or to close all applications
very handynot so handy is the infrared send utility which only allows you to send one file at a time
multiple contacts and notes can be sent at once but not ordinary files via the file explorer utility
in between files you have to close the utility and restart it to send another filethis is a good value but the screen is very difficult to read in less than perfect lighting conditions
under bright flourescent lights in the office it is fine
the rest of the time though i have a heck of a time with it
the internal memory also isnt really big enough to store mps
i decided to go back to paper and penvery nice slick little unit with a ton of funcionality
adding the cf sleeve adds quite a bit to its size but its still manageable
battery life isnt all that great
kinda wish i could replace them instead of having to shut it off and wait till i can charge it
other beefs i have is  bit color and having to use the expansion jacket for cf cardsim pretty much in agreement with the previous reviewer jeffery hauck
in my case my pc tower died just a few days before i went to get this item
when i went to sites which make custom pcs low  behold that zip drives are no longer made unless i went external  ive gotused quite a few  mb zip disks throughout the years with my old puteri just got the external  have been putting it through its paces on a laptop compaq nx
kudos to amazon or ups for getting it to me much earlier then expected
so far its performing to expectations  while noisier then my old internal the noise isnt so bothersome that i cant do anything else
ive also not experienced the slowness that a couple of people have mentioned  ive been putting in a few pdfs into those disks of the  mb rangehaving written the above though ill be the first to admit that the technology is dated to say the least which is sad cause i liked my zip disks
i could get a  gb usb drive for around  at this point
i would say get this older tech if youve got zips  transfer them to a usb drive or other external when you can this is what i intend on doing
as much as i liked my zip  zip disks the reality is that its kinda the modern day beta
the reason i gave it  stars is that ive yet to get my new tower  try it out  that its noisier then my old internal zip drive
i may give it another star depending on how it reacts to my new towerunfortunately i had to purchase this product because of legacy media i owned
i would have preferred not to but it does function wellthe camera comes with an easy set up extra instruction sheet
easy
sounds good
first the olympus batteries wouldnt fit
wife says quottake it backquot finally a very hard push got them in
second the smartmedia memory card wouldnt connect
wife says quottake it backquot finally a hard push got it in
third was setting the time
this was a major production due to the very complex menu
quotwife says quottake it backquot  finally its time maybe to take a picture
turned camera on
no picture on the back screen
hmmmm this is not good
reread the easy set up extra instruction sheet word for word
wife says quottake it back it doesnt workquot  finally in very tiny print we find that there is a quotmonitorquot button
take some snaps
so far this was the easy part
installed the camedia software on pc which comes with virtually zero documentation
plugged in the usb cable and camera
winse sees camera but doesnt find a driver
easy set up instruction says nothing about software or drivers
the thick mostly foreign language instruction book says see driver instructions on the camedia disk
i look and look and look
no driver instructions could be found on the disk
based on previous pc experience i point winse to the camedia disk sub sub directory for drivers
winse finds driver
whew
all is good so i think
boot up camedia and attempt to transfer pictures from camera to camedia
no go
camedia cant find camera
call a friend for help
friend tells me actually the camera is now just another hard drive
shut down the worthless camedia and let windowsse go find the new olympus hard drive
finally i find the snaps on the olympus drive and insert the snaps into some family email
time to call it a very long nightits an unavoidable part of the aging process
if you are over  years old every day that passes its getting harder for you to see small print in dim light even with proper glasses
although this palm does everything i need it to do and pretty darn fast the display leaves a lot to be desiredi purchased this palm because i need to run a drug data base for doctors called epocrates
most of the time i am selecting drugs from a very long pick list which runs from the top to the bottom of the screen
the font appears to be about  point same size as most other text displayed on this palm
often lighting is too low to allow the screen to be read but too bright to derive any benefit from the backlight
this results in having to chase down some brighter lightthese display problems absolutely do not exist with the hp jornada line
you can buy a jornada with a colour display and twice as much memory mb for about  more
the jornada can accept memory upgrades and operating system upgrades
moreover a jornada will do anything a palm can do except run epocratesbut if you have  year old eyes and want to save  and dont care about colour displays and dont want to ever upgrade your operating system or memory then the palm  is a capable though limited producthaving used a jornada for some time now i really find the palm line disapointingreceived this item as a gift
worked perfectly for just over a year until it went on the fritz and i ended up having to return to the store where it was bought i passed on palms telephone support chargefor someone who isnt convinced they need a fancy pda or who doesnt have the cash to spend on one the m is a great bargain buy
i quickly adjusted to the small screen though i resorted to entering all data via my computer then hot syncing because its a little cumbersome to try to type on the handheld
it is not only convenient for keeping track of your appointments and having your address book at your fingertips but i found the  megs of memory was more than enough to store several games and ebooksthe leather carrying case is very stylish and the three inner pockets are perfect for holding business cards credit cards cash or small notesthe small size of the m allowed for easy storage in my briefcase or coat pocketobviously i was disappointed at the sudden failure of the m but as a lowcost alternative to higher end pdas i was very pleased with it overallthis is just an ok organizer
i bought it for my  year old and he is happy with itmy parents bought me this for my birthday and i returned it within a week and bought a visor deluxe
why
the only real difference is the screen on the m and m which is noticeably smaller
with a monochrome screen to begin with and the builtin difficulty of pointing and clicking on a palm device size mattersid recommend buying a visor deluxe which is a better buy for the money in this price range and has better expandability
i love my visor
if you want to trade up consider the palm vx which my dad has
its basically the same thing in a superslim package with a rechargeable lithium battery but its costlieri also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy new m but in that price range i think a pocketpc might make more sensei bought the samsung  a couple months ago as my first dvd player
the price seemed reasonable and i liked the remote control
i also liked the samsung year warranty on parts and labor
most players have a day warranty on labor and a year warranty on parts which means you are taking a risk if you do not buy an extended service contract from your retailerconnection and setup were fast and easy and the owners manual is excellent logically organized and with clear instructionspicture and sound were fine but there were sporadic though noticeable break ups in the picture where it would disintegrate into large pixels
these are not the fault of the discs since they dont always happen in the same place at the same timemore annoying than the occasional picture problems is the slowness with which the player loads the dvd and responds to the remote control
the remote response is so slow that i often was not sure if the player had even received the signal until  or  seconds after i had pushed the button
while you do get used to this after a while its a real drawbackthe ergonomics of the remote itself are very good with an intuitive layout but this is offset by the slowness of the players responsethe player does a good enough job that it got me hooked on dvds but after a month i relegated this player to the bedroom and bought a toshiba  that is far superior to the samsung and only cost about a bit morethe toshiba also has a great feature that the samsung lacks  the first zoom level on the toshiba gives you a slightly larger letterboxed image for widescreen dvds without cutting off much at the sides and with no discernable loss of image sharpness
this is a real convenience on my  tv maintaining the widescreen ratio but giving a bigger image
the samsung has a feature called sfit which supposedly does the same thing but the manual says it does not work on all discs and i never got it to work on any of mine
the toshiba works for all the discs i have and its a feature i would not sacrificebottom line on the samsung pro  good remote good picture good sound year warranty parts and labor good instruction manualcon  sporadic picture problems slow to load dvds and slow to respond to remote level zoom does not increase image size for widescreen dvdsif you want a good basic player and dont want to pay for an extended warranty consider the samsungthis samsung model is a good value
while its not the most consistent player on the market for the price you pay you are getting a nice bargain
it froze up on one of the first movies we watched on it but that might have been due to the fact that it was a blockbuster rental
basically you get what you pay for
overall its a nice dvd player for an even nicer price that you will enjoy for a long timethere really two perspectives here one from someone who has ownsuses a highend nikon    and the other from a new digital camera user   
i point this out because midrange digital cameras are not really going to placate all of the needs of the amateur photographer but may be appropriate for your situation
caveat photographerthe biggest adjustment ive had with the c is the slowness in taking pictures  delays of   to  seconds fresh batteries not including the startup time for the lens to extend to the default setting before the photo is actually grabbed
while fine for still life this is a problem for truly spontaneous photos such as of ones kids
expect blurry pictures on anything thats moving at more than a walking pacea second criticism is the flash seems too bright and colors wash out
you can compensate for this in photoshop but i dont really think you should have toon the positive side uploading pictures is extremely easy on my win machine i just plug the camera in and the cameras pictures appear as a removable device
just cut and paste to your local machineresolution is very good and services like ofoto can print up to xquot prints from the default x image size
with a mb memory card you can get  pictures at this resolution
the menu system in the camera is fairly extensive and you can alter default behavior such as turning off the cameras beep changing color mode shutter speed color balance date and resolution
another nice feature is you can enable verbose data display which will show you what settings were used for each photothe movie feature is actually more fun than i thought it would be
pictures are jumpy and the audio is fair but i enjoy having it as an option
you can record up to  seconds in one swoop  this is a limit of the cameras internal memory not the memory card size usedfor its intended use case this works very well for scanning in aps films   and  exposure
i have a coolscan v ls and use vuescan software
i scanned in quite a lot of images quite happily
some months afterwards i had to scan in some more aps films and the adapter jammed leaving the film stuck in the adapterthe adapter is also really loud when spooling and unspooling film from the cartridge
if you are in a smallish room you will not want to scan too many films in one sittingon the whole i have been happy and may well purchase another one just because i still have aps films to scandisappointed that the swivel mount is not included
seriously would it have been difficult to include it for a buck or two more
having to order separately is a painotherwise works pretty well fro me
besides not having to wind the cord by hand it also does not twist using this reelthe product description says winds  feet of cord in  seconds
i dont think that is possible
perhaps if the cord came straight from the store never used and was laid out perfectly straight in front of the crank for its entire length and the person doing the cranking was a strong armed athlete  but the cord that has been in use and acquired some kinks as they all do will take much longer
and if the cord was outside in the cold weather which makes the cord stiffer it would take significantly longeri bought the winder for  feet electric cord i use to power a toro power shovel
last winter when i was just coming back from back surgery dealing with the cord was harder on my back then pushing the power shovel
i needed to find a better solution than winding it around my elbow
this crank is likely to take me  minutes to wind the cord into the net but for me it is worth it because even though it is not as easy as advertised it is still easier on my back than winding it around my elbow
and once cord is in the net it is neater than the loose bundle that i create by coiling it around my armi am attaching several photos to the customer photos for this product visible if you click on customer photos under the stock photothe winder came in  parts see photo  and a long sheet of instructions
it was fairly easy to assemble and install
i am not very handy yet it took me only about  minutes
the instructions for the assembly and operation were clear
the unit protrudes  inches from the wall plus it is installed onto a mount which is  inches
so you need a total clearance of  inches
the width of the unit is  inches
photo  shows the mounted winderthe mount has  mounting holes
the instructions are to attach the mount using the two horizontal holes
but the stud where i wanted to mount the winder was not wide enough to use both of those holes
so i mounted it using the top  hole and one of the horizontal holes
so far this mount appears to have sufficient stability for the crank to workthe unit comes with two mounting bracket
i plan to put one mount outside but i have doubts that the winder will work on the cold stiff cord given than it was difficult to coil a warm pliable cord
i suspect that after using the power shovel i will have to bring in the cord uncoiled have it warm up and then coil inside the houseupdate the winder worked ok  it did slip some and required a bit of guiding by hand so it was not fast but easier on my back than winding the long cord without itwhen you mount the bracket locate it at a height where the crank of the unit is at a comfortable level to crank it
when you coil the cord you will need both hands
as you crank with one hand the other hand will be pushing on the lever that pushes the cord against the  drive wheel
photo  shows where the cord goes between the level and the coiling wheel
if the cord does not stay in the center of the wheel the wheel does not grab it and the cord does not coil photo  is taken from above and shows a good view of the cranking mechanism
i am a bit disappointed that it took quite a bit of work to get  feet of the cord into the net
as you see in the photo  feet filled the net pretty much to the top i am not sure how  feet cord would fit into the net
the mechanism that pushes the cord against the wheel seems to be the weakest point of the winder as the cord often slips and needs to be readjusted
but overall it did work so i am ranking it as  star okali julia reviewthis does just what its supposed to do
but on mine the basket pulled off the winder and is tricky to put back on
a wire holds the netting in place around the neck of the winderi like this winder for the most part
its nice to be able to use your own extension cord and determine the length of lead from the winder to the outlet
most retractable extension cords have a short lead cord on them
you could lengthen this if needed but that would require a new plug and a splice in the cord
retractable extension cords also pass power from the lead cord to the extension cord through brushes which limit the ampacity of the cord and will eventually need replaced if you wind and unwind it enough
overall this is a nice product
i just wish the details would accurately state that its made in china since there was a sticker on mine that said soi bought this after using one in my home for many years
this one was for my summer home
what is missing from this is the part that connects to the rear so that it actually swivels on a hinge
this didnt have that and you have to mount it on a flat surface
hopefully itll be in the right directionthe wonder winder arrived as specified if may have come earlywonder winder works most of the time
it has a little trouble if the cord is wet also when it is dirty
i discovered that if you rough up the main wheel with some sand paper or a rough file it truly helps
give it a tryi realy like that i can wind up my cords so fast with the wonder winderit makes my work area look alot cleaner with no cords on the floormake sure there are no kinks in your cord and it is stretched out straight before the initial wind
i also suggest doing it indoors
up here in frostbite falls  i tried it in the garage with a cold cord and the rollers had a hard time gripping the cord
im going to try rubberizing the small roller to improve gripi tried this winder with two cords
both were 
one of them was lighter duty and more flexible
this device worked fine with it
it was a relatively short cord so my experience was limited
the second cord i tried might have been considered heavy duty
but as a  cord its still medium duty at best considering the cords that this device is supposed to work with
i wasnt able to get it to work at all
even with enough pressure to leave black streaks on the cord it would not go down into the netthe bottom line is that this will work well with cords that will naturally wind into a tight circle but if your cord has a tendency to want to wind into a bigger circle it will never go down no matter how much pressure you useid recommend this for lighter duty highly flexible cords
for my own use it was inadequate and needed to be returned
if you have true heavy duty cords even gauge  or very long cords you might wish to consider aquick winder rap electric cord and fiber optic cable reel
i wouldnt consider that a competing product since its about three times the price and not a wall mounted solution but it will work with cords that this device wont be able to handle
however if you want the convenience of being able to wind and unwind lighter duty cords from a stationary position this might be a good product for youalthough the unit itself is fine the software bundle and accessories are pathetic
the included mp encoder can only rip mps at low quality and the cd burning software is very basic
aheads nero would have been nice
its the best cd burning program on the market and has an optional fraunhofer mp encoder
the accessories are just as bad with cheap headphones and a cheaper carrying case unless you like genuine pleather
in the end youre really paying for the hardware since the included bundle doesnt add much valueup until now mpcd players have been lacking one very important thing good id tag support
what good is a few hundred songs if you cant browse and choose a song title you want
i sure as hell dont want to sit and memorize all of the songs i have on a cd
aside from this little feature the sound is of average quality
nothing to do backflips over but it is okay
the biggest problem is the cd not playing when the player is turned sideways
i always put my cd player in my pocket on the go but this player will skip when you do this
that is what is preventing me from buying this and this is also why i think the price is so low
this is close to an ideal player but not quite yet
improvements need to be made on the hardware
until that happens i am keeping my money until a player comes out that is worth my moneyit works
doesnt fit my head very well and there are multimode bluetoothwireless usb headsets that perform just as well for the same pricei didnt really use it everyday but i did use it often and then after  years all of a sudden the left ear no longer had soundi still though it was a good headset though
gotta love that volume and mute buttoni often use a headset with my pc for chats recording and rosetta stone
i liked this headset a lot but the metel that holds the two pieces together bent and them the mic stopped working
the mute button never worked eithergood quality a totally geek look bulky and flimsysound and mic pick up everythingit makes you look like a telephone operator or a nerd playing on wow perhaps like methe dsp box is huge for what its supposed to dothe compact folding is flimsy when you set the headset down and it starts to fold back upi have speakers and use a headset
so i have  sound options problems can occurusb function i particularly do not appreciate enough
the usb sound controls my external speakers and not just the headset
analog may not be as clean but it is definitely more controlable
and they used to make one that wraps around the back of the headfind a cheap analog plantronics
i had one before for  and it lasted me about  years but i tend to be rough with my thingsi like the feel the sound and the quality of this pc headset but i have a few complaints and reasons why i favor the logitech pc gaming headset much more
first of all i do not like the idea of sound being transmitted through the usb port
most computers have headphonemicrophone jacks that are directly connected to the pc sound card
why waste a valuable usb port on a headset when the ports for these type of devices are already presentsecondly if you are looking for a pc gaming headset i found these to cause game freezes way too often
again going through usb ports to get sound is not the most efficient means
i highly reccommend a more standard  mini plug setup direct to the mic and headset portsgood luckfor the price it wasnt worth itclear  works well good mic but uncomfortable squashes ur earstried to get it to work even talked with plantronics tech support which tried to help
couldnt get the microphone loud enough
the volume control for the microphone was greyed out and the one in the software kept going down to medium even though i would try and turn it upit was given as a gift to my boy friend or his son they wanted it and needed it
it arrived promplythis headphones sound good and so does the microphonebut they tend to fall off your head because that rubberband isnt tight enough to hold then around your ears
i have to punch new holes n wrapped it to the frame with clear tape so it can embrace my head a bit tighter
buy it at your own discretejust because dont know whether the amazonbasics will work on my k i bought this one
kind of too expensivei am using this with my pentax kx
short and sweet barely works further that  and you have to be direct line of sight
in my case i wanted to be able to shoot wild life this is kind of hard to do if you are  away from the subject matterthe product description says it works up to  feet away
im not sure if there are conditions to this statement but all i know is that it doesnt work that far away for me
i have to be right next to the camera when outdoors in the bright sunlight
i purchased this item so i could do family group photos more easily
i was tired of trying to run and pose for a picture before the camera timer ran down
this summer we were all posing out on the beach and i never could get the remote to work unless i was practically standing nose to lens with my camera
im not sure if it works better indoors but if youre planning to use it outside i can tell you its not a good choicei ordered to use with my kd
yes it works to snap a shot but doesnt focus or work in bulb
it would have been nice to know this before buying but with very limited info on pentaxs site you cant find that out with out extensive research or other peoples reviews here
i think ill get the corded release later to handle the af and bulb functions
i guess if you were setting up a shot of the family or friends and prefocused it would work very wellim using a k
for many people this tiny remote is a  star for photos of the family during a birthday party posing for a wedding and using a tripod
but im challenged and not excited
the position of the sensor on the camera is at the bottom front right side of the camera
when you put the camera on a sweater your backpack some object that supports the camera fiddle with the camera to compose the photo then try to take the shot i frequently find the sensor is covered
even if you put the camera on a tripod but stand to the left side of the camera imagine  people lined up and you are to one side the lens can block the signal to fire the camera
you need to stand in the middle or right of the camera
some fiddling and planning is required to use the remote
the sensor on the k needs to be high and central to make excellent use of the pentax remote
im going to need to purchase a more expensive but for me a more user friendly remote
this is so far my only complaint about the k
ill keep and use this remote as its so tiny but it can be quirky to usei received perhaps a bad copy
nevertheless the lens would not focus properly on any subject
even adjusting inbody had no effect
i do not mean i was not able to adjust it enough
i mean af tuning had no effect at all
the lens would find a random point and focus
switching to manual i was not able to focus the lens more than one of four shots
this indicates a mechanical rather than electronic problem
perhaps transit damage
who knowsswitching to mf i found the af confirmation to be incorrect
chose then to ignored the af confirm which would appear to find the correct focal point but in fact the shot would be front or back focused
now if it were one or the other one could compensate
but the focal point appears to be quite random
i had better luck ignoring af confirmation but at that point i might as well have been using my takumar mf lensi needed a guaranteed solution quickly so i returned this unit to amazon and yielding to my true desire purchased the da m f instead
now that is a lens and a case for a separate reviewi gave this lens three stars on the lifelong knowledge that pentax products for me are the best in the world with consistent quality beyond that of nkon or cnon or the other makers
i did not want my experience to skew the rating of the lens
a lot of things can go wrong from the factory door to ones own door so it is not even safe to assume the lens was not performing well at the factoryif considering this lens please read all the reviews to see if other purchasers had problems
if not then you should assume i just received a bad copy
my decision to choose a different lens rather than a replacement was just thatmy decision
i assume a replacement would have performed well based on other reviewsi am providing this review as information only not judgment
please use it accordinglyim using this lens with a pentax k
there is nothing wrong with it besides incorrect automatic focusing so i have to do it manually
thats the only thing i found to be wrong with iti think i paid  for this card but that was a long long time agoin my informal comparison of the transfer rate of mb compact flash cards by viking simpletech and kingston the viking card came in a distant third
the viking card took about  longer to transfer identical data
my card at least did not meet the stated specified transfer rateso where speed of transfer is important the viking card may not be the best choice
for other less critical tasks the viking card has proven perfectly adequateviking products are competitively priced my problem with this product is not the functioning of it but the fact that cases made for the ipaq wont support use of this product
it works exactly as designed with no problems whatsoever
i can even plug in the sleeve hot and it works like plug and play
but if you need a case youll have to use an aftermarket large pda case or a small digital camera casefor  bucks you cant really go wrong or can youlisten if you are using this just for the purpose of backing up files go with it but if you are going to be using this very often i recommend the pc card one
of course its a little bigger but if you are going to add to the size anyway for the compact flash card slot you might as well go for the pc card
the battery helps a lot and i can usually get  to  hours of use out of my pda
 hours for mps
this is a good product but by no means the bestupon first glance this is a winner
it is sleek it is solid it has a great bw screen and a weighted stylus it is rechargeable has an integrated cover has enhanced applications and comes with a blazing usb syncronization cradleso whats wrongthe major problem seems to be a well documented history of hotsync problems
mine occured approximately  days after purchase
there was no way to correct this
i reinstalled the software on three different workstations performed numerous soft resets subsequent hard resets cursed screamed cried and went into denial
finally acceptance set in and i realized that i was no longer syncronizable
packed it up and sent it back
thank god for amazoni lost my visor deluxe and decided to quotupgradequot to the edge
immediately ive discovered that the awkward position of the hinged cover makes it cumbersome and impractical for the kind of frequent quick uses i make of the device
because you cant fold the cover all the way back actual use of the edge in effect quotdoublesquot its size besides making it hard to manage on small surfaces or quoton the flyquot  of course i could take the cover off entirely but that exposes the electrical contacts to possible damage
now i have no choice but to return the unit and order another deluxe
bummer
youd think the handspring people would have had the foresight to provide a more thoughtfully designed hingethis fullsized keyboard folds out from a rectangle roughly the size of your ipaq
it has a function key which provides added convenience such an quotokquot key that simulates tapping the quotokquot button on the screen with your stylusthe board was advertised to support the newer  series ipaq on the vendors site
i missed the fine print that explained that you had to call in to get a converter piece from targus
that put me out a little bit
the converter did have an input for the power cord which the keyboard was lacking
so with the converter you can charge your ipaq while you type on the keyboardthe backstand metal frame that supports the weight of the ipaq while it is inserted onto the keyboard is flimsy feeling
it becomes even more noticeably awkward feeling when one of the expansions packs like the cf expansion pack is attached to the ipaq
definitely this is part of the keyboard needs to go back to the drawing board
i also noticed that the keyboard tends to slightly bounce up and down while typing on some surfacesi really like the way this keyboard folds together and apart
i think targus is a topnotch company
its definately better than no external keyboard but i would check out compaqs new portable ipaq keyboard before buying this onebut i would prefer if it were a little sturdier
it just feels so light and flimsly
like it could break at any moment
especially the dvd drawer
be careful with iti find this model particulary cool because it can play cdrs which is something a lot of them cannot do
but recently i have found a few problems with playback
this may be due to age a year now and wear and tear but sometimes it will freeze skip and refuse to eject
i dont know if it is a common fault but i had to send it off to panasonic the first timenow i have discovered that a good thump on the top will pop the drawer open and reset the machine
my machine is also non regionencoded so i can play movies from anywhere in the world
i can only assume that this one is too considering it is the same modeli have it connected to a widescreen tv and sherwood  decoder with beautiful eltax speakers around my living room
the player is a vital component in that great package
and with a lesser model the dtsdolby sound and the picture would not be as cooli just wish i could have more trust in itthese products were generally well reviewed in the technology media when introduced for use with prewindows xp oss
and if you call linksys before purchasing as i did and ask if they play well with windows xp the sales and tech staff will tell you of course
the correct answer is of courseas long as you are comfortable tweaking your computers network connection settings and dont expect the linksys documentation to address the os now being delivered with new wintel pcsthe wired router installation was a piece of cake i use a wired port for the pc colocated with my router and cable modem
this partially because the linksys install routine and browser based setup instructions worked well but partially because my cable provider is not fussy about nic mac addresses and the router recognized the providers mail domains which in my case included one thats abbreviated and some that differ from the address domain name due to a recent acquisition these are both areas that linksys is helpful enough to prepare you to overcome and your mileage may vary depending on your cable providerthe usb wireless adapter under windows xp was considerably more challenging
my install was hampered by a local hardware issue a device conflict between a usb  port on a separate pci card and the motherboard usb ports
i had blue screens upon restart when using the pci port these continued until i tried one of the motherboards  usb ports and then the install proceeded as normalthis is where my main gripe with linksys develops the will tell you before purchase that their products work with windows xp  and they dobut youd better be prepared to tweak and geek without their help
when i called about my blue screens i spent  frustrating minutes with a tech support guy and his boss
the boss became part of the picture when the l guy suggested that perhaps i didnt know enough about computers to be trying this and it was obvious that my experience around computers predated his launch from mom install
during the th minute we uncovered an error indicator suggesting this was a hardware issue which led me to try the alternate usb port
but linksys was adamant that they were not there to help me fix my broken osfinally the wireless portion of the network has yet to succeed in establishing a wep encrypted connection
a separate call to linkys yielded another tech support guy illprepared to help troubleshoot the problem
their bottom line sometime the wep activation will work under xp and sometimes it wont
if it wont stand by for their xp update to these devices maybe coming in junethat said my computers on two separate floors are enjoying high signal strength and  shared internet connection
im not overly concerned about the balky wep setup since i live in a low vehicle traffic area shouldnt be many war riders around and i have file sharing turned offbut linksys really needs to get their user guides and tech support scripts updated to accommodate the growing population of windows xp usersi am a network admin and have worked with routers before
it took a long time to set it up but once i did it worked very well
the range is great
i live in an all concrete house and my laptop upstairs has no problem getting the router downstairs and the signal is strongi am having a connection problem of being able to browse from the desktop to the laptop
i explained in my question to tech support that firewall settings are fine etcthe answer i got was quotyou must disable your firewall to get it to workquot
i am not that ignorant
never disable your firewallif you know a lot about routers and such it is a good piece of equipment
if you dont my experience with tech support at linksys makes me believe the unexperienced should stay away from this routerwe have the linksys working just fine now with a pc laptop with a cheap wireless card and a mac going directly into one ethernet port
its been stable for about a week solid
however out of the box it had the same connectiondropping problems that youll read about here and elsewhere on the web it would work for a few minutes then drop the connection
wed have to restart it to get the connection backthat was solved by upgrading the firmware to  july  version i think
that was a painless process that took about two minutes
however this firmware version is explicitly called a beta release and is not supported by the company
so if you want your wireless router to work you have to pretty much give up any hope of future tech support
to me thats reprehensible
linksys  is knowingly selling a broken product and requiring customers to take a chance on making it work on their ownmy advice dont buy this until a new firmware is officially released and you start seeing consistently positive reviews of this producti live in a highrise appartment building in new york city and have had significant problems with this wireless setup on the b standard
i disabled the wep security hoping that it would help performance however i keep getting disconnected from the access poing every  minutes on average
i also get dropped every time i answer my phone ghz phone
the problem is not so much with linksys the product does work as advertised but with the overcrowding of the ghz band
the fcc allows manufactures to produce many types of products in the ghz range bi plan on returning my unit and see if i have better luck with the linksys wapa which runs at exclusive  ghz bandwithoverall i will say that the product does work as expected once you update the firmware to the latest versionive got mixed opinions about my linksys befws wireless port cabledsl router
on one hand i finally got it to work as advertised
on the other hand i had to do it myself with no help from linksysi read several positive and negative reviews here but figured that most of the negative reviews were from people who didnt know an ip address from a cpu
since i knew something about networking i figured that id be able to breeze through installing and configuring this router to work with my cable modem with no problems
wrong
although i had configured the router correctly i later discovered the problem turned out to be defective firmware
i called linksys technical support and after several lengthy waits on hold was only able to leave pleas for their technical support department to call me back which they never didafter no help from linksys i discovered another site that made reference to the exact problems i was experiencing
they mentioned the latest firmware that fixed this problem
i downloaded it from linksys installed it on the router and the problems were largely fixed
heres my list of problems that were fixed  ipsec passthru issues and  bit encryption
bugs remaining to be fixed  occasional router lockup requiring resetnow with ipsec passthru fixed im able to use the router as i intended
the wireless range is significantly less than id expected but im looking for rd party antennas that can address this issue
yes it locks up sometimes but its easy to reset
i give it three stars  if theyd get better technical support id give it four starsi bought this as part of my plan to turn my house into a wireless xbox paradise
aside from problems i had with the wet see my review on that item i later found out that this product cannot support more than one xbox connected to xbox live at a time
i had some inkling that this might be the case as its documented on the xbox live web site but i was holding out hope that the more recent firmware releases may have fixed it
i mean its linksys
its the name in home networking productswell theres always hope for the next firmware releasei tried the cisco linksys router and found at first that the router didnt connect
then after tinkering with it i got it to work
however with some computers the wired interface still didnt work rightwhen i bought this router i used linksys support  to configure it
i am on a mac  was able to call linksys support get through easily talk to someone in the us who was familiar w osx and connect via my dsl modem without a hitch
i recently upgraded to the wrt  tried calling because i couldnt access my routers settings via ie
to my dismay the person on the other end was not a native english speaker  i had a very difficult time understanding him i had to ask him to repeat every instruction at least twice
i was uncomfortable sending out my details phone service provider  ip address to him because of this
as it turns out he was in india
he also said he knew nothing about osx  that i should call apple to find out how to configure my linksys router
well thats helpful
while the new router is considerably cheaper than apples base station i am considering sending it back  paying the difference for apples base station because i am so annoyed that linksys has outsourced its technical support to india even though my befws has worked fine as long as i dont have to change settingsi bought this unit to connect my gateway athlon desktop running windows se and my new companyissued dell p laptop running wk and share a roadrunner cable internet connection via a toshiba cable modem
the gateway is hardwired to the router the laptop wireless via a linksys wireless pc cardto connect to my corporate email i must use a vpn connection to the corporate server and then connect to the mail server with microsoft outlook  via microsoft exchange server
ive been doing so for years without a hitch on the gatewayhardwired to the linksys router my gateway easily connected to both the vpn and the ms exchange mail server
the cable internet connection was shared successfully between the two computers and i could transfer files from one computer to another share the printer digital camera port et al without a hitchhowever i could not access my corporate email account with the laptop either using the wireless linksys pc card or using a hardwired connection with the dells built in  com nic card
i could complete a vpn connection but when outlook tried to open the program responded quotthe microsoft exchange server is unavailablequot
yet i could connect the laptop directly to the toshiba cable modem and access my corporate email with either the ethernet port or a usb connection
oddly too the vpn connection appeared quotdeadquot  ie i had no internet connectivity for my web browsers etc when the vpn was connectedi tried unsuccessfully changing a number of different settings in wk and in the routers webbased configuration utility
i studied all the online documentation at linksys web site but found nothing specific to my situation
i searched the web for answers but was unsuccessful
i emailed linksys corporate support and got a email full of suggestions for port forwarding dmz ad nauseum none of which workedi then spent over two hours on two separate calls to linksys tech support
the first tech thought i needed to upgrade the firmware and told me where to download and to call back if i needed more help
the firmware he suggested refused to load on the router
i called back jumped through a few more hoops before the technician declared the modem quotdefectivequot and that i should return for an exchangei was on the verge of returning the both linksys units for a  refund and buying netgear wifi equipment which id read here are more vpn friendly
im stubborn though and made one final google search of usenet rather than the internet
after an hour or so of searching i stumbled across a recommendation to change the routers internal ip number from  to xxx
it was for a somewhat different problem and a different brand of router and i had no idea whether it would work or not but i was desperatei opened the web based configurator and changed only the internal ip address for the router
i repowered router and rebooted the laptop
i was amazed and delighted
to see my laptop seemlessly connect to the vpn and my microsoft exhanger server email account
and i turned off all the securityreducing port forwarding and wan filter disabling that linksys tech support had urged me to implement to try and get it working
all of that was absolutely needlessi recounted this tale of woe to the local computer store where id purchased the unit
he was dismayed that linksys tech support didnt have such a simple solution on hand
it only took  hours of my life in web searches software tweaking et al but the router finally worked perfectlyits a good unit for a simple straightforward quotvanillaquot installation
however if your configuration is quotout of the ordinaryquot or complicated  i would recommend staying away from this product unless youre already a networking guru and dont require support from linksysive never written a review but i got so much help from others reviews i thought i would return the favorsetting up the befws using my desktop computer which was linked by an ethernet cable was easy
what took me a loooooong time was getting the wireless connection to work with my laptops cisco series  pcmcia wireless lan adapter card
at the end of the day i would have been time and money ahead just to pay the extra money and get linksys lan adapter card but i didnt want to juggle two cards and two wireless profilesit took me some time to realize that ciscos aironet client utility or acua separate program under startprograms and not my windows  operating system controls the important wireless parameters for the card
once i found that out i was able to set the channel infrastructure and other parameters to make a wireless connection
however i couldnt get wep encryption to work at all until i upgraded the firmware driver and acu for the cisco card past my apparently outmoded  point something firmware versioncisco now bundles firmware drivers and acu upgrades together in packages for downloading from its website
but you have to be very careful to select the right bundle
each numerical series of cisco lan adapters has many products with names that look and sound alike and some joker listed two bundles not applicable to my card as for windows  while further down on a long list listing another applicable to my product as windowskmebundleexe
my aging eyes missed the buried reference to k so i downloaded two wrong packages before finally getting the right one
once over these hurdles all proceeded smoothly except that neither linksys nor cisco told me to set the acu for shared encryption keys
i found that out by trial and errorcisco has good instructions on its website for downloading and installing the updated firmware drivers and acus
its newer acus allow nonadministrative users to set up separate profiles for such things as home networks and there is a setting which is supposed to sense which network enterprise or home is transmitting and switch automatically to it
i havent tried this yet but a colleague tells me it works well
what this means is that you can leave the cisco card in its slot as you move the laptop between home and office and the software will switch automatically between your home and office networks as you move from one to the otheri still couldnt get wep encryption to work on the cisco card at  bits
this is not surprising as linsys documentation implies that its bit protocol is proprietary
i did however get wep working at  bits called  by cisco
i could cut and paste the encryption keys directly from linksys webbased access point manager into ciscos acu as long as i remembered not to apply or ok either one until both were set the samelinksys passphrase utility was useful for generating the four bit encryption keys
i noticed that just changing two or three characters in a character passphrase completely changed all four keys suggesting a robust randomnumber generatoronce fully set up the wireless access point worked well
after some fiddling it gave me  to  signal strength through my houses aluminum siding and out to the edge of my back yardyou have to play with the two little antennas however to get the best signal strength
i found the best strength resulted from having one antenna in a nearly horizontal position and the other slightly off vertical
be sure to set your parameters for both access card and lan adapter to diversity which uses both the antennas
people who gripe about signal strength should remember that they are dealing with high radio frequencies
the network uses ghz a frequency much higher and therefore much more susceptible to reflection and interference than the ones used by fm radio stations
just as your body moving around the room as well as many other things can interfere with fm radio signals it can interfere with a home network wireless signal
for example it makes a difference whether you sit between your lan adapter card and the access point and whether your lan adapter cards antenna points toward the access point
short of repealing the laws of physics adding a monster antenna to the access point or increasing its power probably to more than the fcc allows without licensing theres probably not much anyone can do about thisi give linksys high marks for a good physical product but mediocre marks for its documentation of wireless
i doubt im the only one who wanted to adapt an office network card for home use and theres no reason to have to juggle two different lan adapter cards
i would hope that linksys would give a few hints in its documentation about how to get its base station to work with others wireless cards particularly ciscos which seem to dominate the industry
but maybe im just dreaming
the woeful industry custom seems to be if you use someone elses products youre on your own
maybe thats why tech stocks are at an all time lowthis router was working great with really good range for over a year until the day i flashed with  firmware it had firmware at least a year old right out of box
now the router needs to be reset every ten to forty hours because of wireless link dhcp lossi had installed the newer linksys wirelessg routers several times since installing this unit and saw these similar issues and can only conclude that the latest firmware programmers at linksys really suckavoid these routers until these issues have been fixedwe have this router and  of the wireless usb connections too in my home
one is  levels below the router in the basement and has no problem
unfort our network goes down for no understood reason about once every week or two and must be reset before everything goes back online
no idea why
otherwise this works very wellgreat for an apartment or small area
lasted a lil over a year before it started dropping wireless typical of most wireless routersi received the router and despite a degree in systems engineering i couldnt get it to work instantly
after about  mins with tech support and plugging in ip addresses etcwe got it to work
but now i had a bunch of ip static addresses set up in iti wanted it to work totally dynamic since i bounce between a hotel office and dsl  home
so when i deleted the ips amp gateway server settings it didnt work and i couldnt get through to tech support this time
i finally got it to work by changing all the settings and since then it typically works  of the time
the rest of the time i have to reset the router and reset all the settingsproduct still needs a little workprobably just from wear  tear but as i said it worked well three years ago when i first brought it
however i just recently replaced it with the linksys wrtgl because this started to drop the connection too often for me to deal with
i would have to unplug the thing  or  times before i could get internet to the other pcs in my home
g is faster then b these days so the befws isnt needed anymorethis router is great when its working
however this router is a lil picky sometimes
i downgraded the firmware and it seems to be running faster
however i still get problems with the wifi dropping
this is a very common problem with this router and it requires a power cycle to clear out the problem
one of the previous commenters said linksys will give him a new one but i doubt that will fix the problem
while some of the problems are related to firmware others are related to the manual settings
this router needs a lil fine tunning for it to run rightthis router is by far better than my old netgear router which required power cycles more than once a day and it still didnt work correctly
but his router does require some setup since the design is kinda oldi am having the the same problems that spjefferies and other reviewers have expressed in earlier posts cannot get a decent ping from a wpc even at close range
linksys has great cat products but seem to be suffering on the wireless end
is this just me or has anyone else solved the wpc ping problemsone one side i used swear by linksys as they are easy to use and configure even if one doesnt understand routing terminology
on the other side now that i am starting to understand this stuff i am finding many bugs that are frustratingi had the box actually crash a few times
it crashed a few times when configuring using the port forwarding feature where one would map an incoming port like http or port  to one computer inside the house
the box wouldnt take the port and eventaully crashed
i had to reset the device erasing the setupanother problem i found is that you are forced to use linksyss limited dhcp
lets say you crafty enough to setup a dhcp on your lan with something like linux or windows server
this dhcp will not work for wireless only the lan
  this makes wireless limited especially when adding a little security by controlling who gets what ip addressfor wireless i couldnt find ways to secure this other than through the limited and crackable wep feature which doesnt work btw for some wifi cards
theres also no filtering in of particular laptops within your home using permitted mac addresses
maybe future versions will fix thisnow shifting gears to the stuff i do like
it has a simple web interface which is intuitive and easy to use
the password sent over the wire is insecure in cleartext but should be safe for nonwireless users
it has some logging features that can help in discerning if the network is being attacked usually quite often not surprisingly and for advanced features it supports filters good for filtering out ports used by potential wormsviruses for doing damage on the internet port forwarding with a limit of  forwards good for most basic of needs staticdynamic routing features  mac address cloning and dmzon a last note i really like the industrial design of the case esepcially for stacking other linksys products like switches on top of itoverall this box is great for home users with basic needs and for this would give it  stars
it would lose a star because the wireless doesnt offer enough in a way of security so a big negative there
though for advanced users there are a lot of unecessary limitations bugs and crashes dhcp only  port forwarding entries security etc
 this would be a  stars
thus this averages in the middlei had no problems setting it up and it worked fine for quite a while
now that we use the internet more often though like playing online games using im with voice connecting wirelessly from my pocket pc etc it seems to disconnect several times each night
we ruled out the cable modemconnection at least our cable company claims theres no problem
they did have me separate the cable modem and wireless ap saying they use the same frequency and may interfere with each other
it made no difference
their final quotsolutionquot was to remove the router and just have one pc connected directly to them
i did that for a night just to test it and had no disconnectionsi emailed linksys support and they responded the same day
unfortunately though i dont think the person knew what he was talking about
i cant quote him directly per the disclaimer in his email but to paraphrase he basically said we were lucky the router kept a connection at all with multiple computers accessing the wan at the same time
isnt that the whole point of a router
doesnt this device use nathe suggested using port forwarding to fix the problem but im not trying to setup a server or anything so i dont see the point
he also told me to adjust my mtu value giving me about  values to try saying to try each one until my connection was more stable
i may still try that before giving up completely but i dont see why the mtu setting should make a difference eithersome people have mentioned similar problems that went away after a firmware upgrade
once the problem started showing up i upgraded to the latest firmware
it made no differencei sent another email asking for clarification and additional support about  days ago and havent gotten a response yet
i forwarded it to them again today
im not expecting any real help from them at this point
ill probably end up replacing it with another brandperhaps  days to install it and not to be able to do it are much lost one of time to others can serve to them but i believe that besides knowledge it needed a cd because when you enter the page cisco web they want cobrarte too much money by any thing i better create sera to think it and to buy something new  it sends in the end it of return for backi purchased the router and two instant wireless network pc cards after reading several positive reviews
i was up and ruuning in about  minutes
i have not tested the extreme limits with the laptops however it works well anywhere in the housethe product is very easy to set up
the ethernet ports seem to be a bit too small so removing cat  cables is difficult
i was dissapointed to learn that you cannot lock down the wireless network to a specific set of macs
this seems like a very basic and useful feature
overall i would shop around and see if you can do better with netgear for the moneyrouter connections to computer and internet is easy
whats not easy is finding the right codes and ip addresses for your setupive used this router for nearly two years and whilst it is relatively easy to setup it can give you problems if youre not sure what youre doingwhen i first installed it it would crash every day
so i upgraded the firmware and it worked fine
no problemswhen i moved home i had dsl installed and then my problems started
streaming video would cause it to crash and my connections would die
i downgraded to the original firmware factory default and streaming worked fine
only problem then was the router would still crash when i went to certain sites myspacecom being one of themafter weeks of trying various settings i still have connection issues and decided to change routers and go with netgearfor this router to be great value it all depends on which service provider you use and what type of connection they have
my last was ppoe and thats when my headache startedwhen i first bought it it was money well spent
but i soon out grew itok ive gotten to be quite familiar with the wireless linksys products and their misleading descriptions
i have written reviews already for the linksys wpc wirelessb notebook adapter and the linksys wusb wirelessb usb network adapter and could have saved some time by just going to the source of the problem the linksys befws wirelessb cabledsl routerinstallation of the router is the easiest part i dont know what the big fuss is
if this is the first time youve ever tried to add any quotaftermarket computer partsquot to your pc then it may be a new experience but not difficult
its as simple as plugging everything in and downloading the setup on the included cd
its not that hard people cmon just read the directions it comes withnow that ive tried to destroy that myth heres a true problem with this product poor wireless range of adaptors from the router
ive used this product for about  months or so and was a bit disappointed with the signal strength of my computer connected to the adapter after the first hour of using it each time
when you first plug in the adapter to the network its signal strength is described as quotexcellentquot
not too long after it drops to quotgoodquot to quotpoorquot in a matter of  minutes
after that such time the signal would constantly cease to work but then to kick back up to the quotpoorquot signal strength every few minutesi would have to make the prediction that my router and adapter are no further than  ft apart and one floor difference in my house
the product details on this site describe it to having ft range indoors
i would expect that the signal strength would not fade to minimal or none after viewing that description but after short usage or minimal intereference ie
a person walking by the adapters the signal should not but does lose most if not all its signal strengthhowever a month ago i decided to try using the linksys wirelessb signal booster wsb in the attempt to boost my signal to the my pc adapter and laptop adaptor
it was an extremely easy quotpiggybackquot set up to my wireless router and wouldnt you know it the adapter has been working like a charm ever since
the average signal strength is now mostly quotvery goodquot every now and then rising to quotexcellentquot or falling to quotgoodquoti give this product  stars because the adapters work great  ft or less from the router to the adapters but its irritating and aggravating that i have to spend more money and more time to improve this products performance  for a booster
to improve its range to ft
unfortunately i dont think amazon sells this product anymore
i got mine at circuit cityif you want wireless this router will do the job nicely
with bit wep its minimally secure enough to deploy in a home environment
however contrary to company literature and the users guide it will not allow the designation of mac addresses as gono go
all it will alllow is quotno goquot  so the mac filtering that is advertised only works to cut off a networked computer from accessing the internet
fine if youre controlling your kids but not so fine if what you want is to positively designate the computers that are allowed to use the wireless system in your home to avoid hackingupdate june  by may of  the wireless portion of this device was failing
i had to reset the barricade about every  days
at least one other person reports a similar experience after  years of use
i got about  months of usei dont know that the competition is much better
i suspect to get a robustly build device that generates rf you may need to pay quite a bit more perhaps on an apple airport or a cisco wapfor what its worth the barricade supported pc and mac clients for about  months with good performance
documentation in later versions of this device was much better
the multifunction device includes routerfirewall nat ports and a wan port in my case the wan is really my existing fixed lan see below a pc print server
requires installing software on wink machines os x has some support
setup in os x is tricky
search usenet for my postings on that wireless access point wapthis is a more complex device than the breezecom breezenet i used to have
the breezecom was a bridge it didnt even have a network address
it acted like a hub and was transparent i configured the wireless client just as i would a wired device on my lanit would be better if the smc device were firewall protecting my lan from intrustion from an unauthorized wireless client see b security issues but as a device installed into my wired lan its pointing the wrong way
the smc wap is already working inside my lan so the firewall is protecting the wireless laptop against the machines on my regular lan
in fact the real threat is unauthorized wireless client access to my wired lan machinesphysically its unobtrusive the antennae need to be oriented vertically
it comes with a large power brick transformer i wish theyd charge  more and get a transformer thats easier to plug in to a crowded upsinstallationi downloaded and installed the painless rom upgrade
router configuration is by web browser theres no other access
for initial configuration i plugged one machine directly into the router and changed the network settings as per the manual
for some reason the dhcp function didnt work but i didnt spend any time on it
i just gave my desktop machine an ip address of  subnet  and set the gateway to the router  once i had upgraded the router and had control of it i changed it to have an external address of  so it would be visible on my lan with a fixed addressthe cable from my existing hub connects into the wan port so my lan is the wan from the routers perspective and all my lan machines are in a dmzi think ill eventually put all my machines on the same size of the smc firewall and rely on the b security recommendations for what theyre worth
so then ill have two firewalls so i could put a machine between them in a real dmz to act as a lightweight external server
for now the wireless client can access web servers in the wired lan and it can get out to the net but it cannot access window services on the wired lanfor now the setup isinternet  dslcisco router   hub  pcs  old macintosh all x smc device   wireless client xi am writing this review in hopes that someone will find the information useful
i have an apple airport and was buying this for  reasons
one was the print server
two was i wanted to extend the range of my network by somehow bridging the  stations
third i had hoped that the range would be better than the airport since it has external antennas and i had read that this was the casei am not able to completely use the device as a print server
due to the reviews here i am less than anxious to use the device be my primary router so i put it inside my existing firewall
i can only use the print server on machines connected to the router
i can not print to it from other machines that are upstream from the router and there doesnt seem to be a way to turn that on in the configuration even if i disable the firewall
contrary to smcs web site it is easy to configure mac os x to use the print server and instructions are readily available on the internetsecond there does not seem to be a way to bridge wireless networks without having both base stations connected to the ethernet network
i am able to get the autoroaming to work as long as they are both connected to ethernet
i was hoping to get some extra range by just plugging in one of the base stations and using it as a bridge but there doesnt seem to be any way to do this
maybe i just havent looked in the right place yetthird i had read that the range on this device was better than my airport and was looking forward to that but it hasnt happened
my base is upstairs in my house and i lose the signal less than  feet from the station
i wanted to have it at least cover my yard a standard city lot but it doesnt even get closei am probably going to look at running some ethernet cable and placing the nd base station at the far end of the house and hope that i can get coverage that way
i do have the quotbadquot model but havent had anything terribly wrong yetive owned this router for some time and did tons of research
granted i am not a typical user you should be warned with this companys shady business practice
many of you wonder whats going on with the mixed reviews and heres whysmc sells this router with  models with completely different hardware
one is the  model
this is the model that was reviewed and gotten great reviews
then the other shady model they slipped into the market is the infamous  model
this is the junk model that they have not distributed to reviewersthe  model is wonderful piece
if you have it youll love it
every  months or so i will have to power it down and i am not sure why
besides that its wonderful
the router requires you to reboot almost every time you change something but its a minior thing you have to live with securemote worked like a champ with no packet forwardingthe  has tons of problems and they are inability to handle large files megs
it hands the router
supposidly a bad capacitor unable to forward udp packets
though the routers page claims to work and their idiotic support claims they work it doesnt
i spent weeks troubleshooting and sniffing the packets and found out it just doesnt foward udp packets router is flaky in general
i attribute this to combination of router getting confused with ghz phone nearby and overheatingin short i had a  and after fighting battles with it and the support for  months i got smc to replace it with   after a year with  i am very pleasedin short if you have the  itll work fine for normal web surfing but beyond that you will soon run into problems mentioned above
maybe a newer firmware i never saw one in  months may resolve few things but their support is useless and will give you a runaroundif you have the  its a keeper
i love minefor price after rebate this is a great unit if you dont have to deal with unknowleageable tech supportduring installation if you have already installed dsl on your first computer you must establish connection to the awbr box hereafter the box with a second computer or remove pppoe from the first computerthe manual assumes that you have not installed dsl software ie
pppoe on the computer that you use to gain access to the boxs loggin menu
note that typing  on your web brower should connect your computer to the box unless you have pppoe installed on your computerin my case i first had to install verizons dsl on my first computer so that i can register and get a user id and password which are to be provided to the box
thereforeusing the first computer with verizon dsl installed i kept running into the choice of logging onto verizon or working offline when i typed  to connect to the box
finally my brother helped out by connecting his laptop ie
the second computer to the box and was able to gain access to the boxs login menubefore figuring out what the problem was with the help of my brother i had to wait for hr  min
for tech support who could only tell me to reset the box several times and that the product was probably defective and offered to send me a new unit
the tech never asked if  dsl pppoe was installed or noti hope this helpsim about to toss mine into the trash
it times out tcp connections if theyve been idle for awhile  minutes
so you cant use it to ssh into your servers and leave a session up for a day or two
sometimes the whole thing crashes and requires power cycling
an email to smcs support staff regarding these issues went unanswerednot sure if this is a bug or a feature but by default the smc box comes up as an open  server with no network name and no wep key ie if you think that you arent using wireless your neighbors may well be cracking into your networkmy old sonicwall was a lot better
it also timed out ssh connections after some idle time but you could change the default from  minutes to 
 okay after a relatively painless firmware upgrade the smc no longer drops connections
but i still ripped it out of my network because i wasnt comfortable with the idea of a bydefault open b base stationi purchased the barricade a few months ago and like many new home wireless users ive since forgotten what life is like without it
by and large im a happy customersetup was truly a breeze
i dont like expending technical energy to set these things up my time carries too much value to spend it in endless configuration
i had some weird issues at startup and had trouble getting the lan connections to work and the directions which are mediocre when theyre correct pointed me into a few dark ip holes
not too much trauma though and i havent touched setup since day onewindows xp plays nice for basic connections but aint nobody happy when things get complex
two problemswep i tried configuring wep with my cisco aironet card and this router and we were not happy
they took different wep keys with different bit sizes and i couldnt get them to speak together after hitting reset a lot i bailed on the projectprinter love the idea of a remote printer
if only the driver didnt crash my computer over and over again
ive decided thats just a project ill need to take on somedaythe range
not fabulous
i can get coverage from one corner of my onefloor apt to the other but its spotty from far away
packets drop but the connection seems to holdso
its fine
does the job
i havent adventured quite yet to get the weird stuff to work
maybe the online help is better than it was two months ago
have funthis router works great on my macintosh network
ive got all my desktop  laptop macs surfing the web wirelessly while they all print to my appletalkbased hp laserjet
its really a phenomenal piece of hardwarethe problem is that the manual is mediocre at best and there is absolutely no macintoshspecific information anywhere in the manual
the macintosh information on smcs website is very sparse as well
so it was difficult to configure this router and get it set up initiallybut once i finally got it set up with the help of some other mac friends  and once i downloaded the firmware updater from their website everything was just finei bought this mouse since april of this year 
this is my first cordless mouse that i have and let me tell you is fantastic having a mouse in which i do not have to worry about the length or some problems caused by the cord of my old mouse
i am only giving this mouse three stars due to the following the signal of the mouse with the base station sometimes is lost if you arent pointing the mouse directly to it
that means that you always have to be pointing to the base in order to have full signal  the batteries die very quickly and the mouse is heavy when it has the batteries in it  is not very precise during fast moving or in firstperson shooter games deus ex unreal tournament max payne etc
if you are a gamer or graphic developer dont buy this mouse
for everyone else if you have the money to spend is an average choice but i would recommend for a little more buying microsoft wireless intellimouse explorer
microsoft mouse are known by their accurate and precision and i have a microsoft intellimouse explorer in my other computer and it has worked excellent
read the reviews and you will find outlet me start by saying i am not a technophile by any strech of the imagination
i simply bought this mouse because i couldnt stand the cord any longer
i have had this almost since the day it hit the market and have been waiting to give it a totally fair review
thats been almost a year and plenty of time and use to be fairmy intial reaction was that it was the greatest product ever invented
it did away with the cord which was such a bother
and because of the optical technology it glides over just about anything i want to use as a mouse padfrom the begining i was concerned about the weight which you do get used to
just be careful if you are prone to repetative motion disease
it has caused me to have more flair upsand my doctor has suggested i get rid of it
however i am hooked and although i think it could be improved wouldnt give it up for anythingthe other problem is the batteries
it inhales them at a much faster rate than was suggested by the information put out by logitech
be prepared and keep a set of spares at your desk at all times
i will say on a positive note that it gives a lot of warning that the batteries are going low
this does give you time to pick up new ones without having to drop everythingi would say this is a great device if you use your computer on a limited basis
if you do serious web work or anything needing a lot of mouse work you might wan to stick to a lighter  and cheaper productthey definitely holds a ton of cds but the pockets could be just a smigg bigger to easily fit booklet and cd in the same pocket better
otherwise it holds cds just finei use this for my dvdsit is completely fullzippingunzipping is a pain so i tend to leave it unzipped which causes a problem when i want to pick it up and use it
it is too heavy and unwieldy really
i think my next one will be a bit smalleri do like that i can move pages around so that i can organize my dvdsthe material is not really good the only thing thats a plus is its roomy you can still put extra more disc because there is still a big space on iti dont really care for the case because of how thin it looks
im wondering if its going to hold up under  cds
i purchase this and the  capacity cddvd case and just like that one the only reason why i am not going to return it is because i am not willing to pay the shippinguseful storage for cds and dvds
this product is worth the money but is nothing speciali expected this to be a thinner product but the spine on this book is about  inches thick which makes it a little more bulky and a little less portable than i expected
the pictures dont convey that
other than that it is a good quality case logic productthe product is great for storage but horrible if you want to remove a sleeve
we had older products of the same thing that had the metal ring binders
those were great
since then we have had two different type of case logic containers
both of those are horrible for fast removal but great for storagei bought the cd  capacity case in late   over the past few decades i have purchased  iterations of this product to accommodate my slowly growing collection of music movies and nintendosony games
while organizing all my discs recently i noticed that the overall quality of the cases has progressively declined over time
the first case i bought back in the early s has a hefty feel to it with a sturdy backbone thick nylon covering and a big well made zipper
the  version is significantly lighter the fronts and backs are supported by thin cardboard which bends with minimal force the covering feels thinner and cheaper and the zipper is as floppy as a wet noodlei still think it is worth the cash i paid for it as i use these mainly for storage now as opposed to back in the s before the invention of the ipod when i actually carried my cds from place to place and required a product that would stand up to some wear and tear
but it is very interesting to see how the product has significantly declined in quality over the last  years
as the saying goes  they dont make em like they used tothe wallet keeps my dvds all together but its a lot thicker than i pictured in my mind
i thought since its not the loose leaf ring type it would be more flexible but its like  thickits oki never used it to be honest but it is ok and that is all i am gonna say abouti guess designing a case to hold this many cds is like building a rocket as its hard to find one that works
but this one doesas good as it gets i guess
my  only gripes are as follows its as ugly as a russian rocket and i just saw it for less money at the local wallmartthe fabric is a little cheap
but thats what you get for the price
it works for what i need it forthe zippers are really lightweight and flimsy
if you open the wallet all the way the zipper gets stuck in the corner because its not sturdy enough
it requires some tugging and positioning to get it to work
there is also no way to label these on the outside so if you have multiples be prepared for lots of openening and closing to figure out which wallet youre in
this just leads to more zippers getting stuckworks ok stores cds and dvds
i dont know of the toxicity of the plastic sleeves touching my discs though one major design flaw the zipper sucksjust received this today and im not as happy with it because it showed a handle in the picture and it doesnt have one
i wont use it for what i ordered it for but ill find some way to use iti purchased the cdw which is the  case version
theres nothing very special about this case
ive seen other more flattering  disc capacity cases but i was looking to save money on a brand that i can trusti purchased about  of these over the last  months
the first five i purchased had a nice handle on the end and the cddvd holder were held in place by a set of bowed plastic guides which allowed for easy viewing and lots of room when you opened and were looking through the case
zipper opened and closed very easily
since then the last three purchased have changed considerably
the sleeves are now sewn into place and there is less roomspace when you open and the cddvd do not lay completely flat
the handle on the end is gone and the zipper is hard to close after being opened all the way due to an excess of nylon fabric
the lack of a handle also makes it less easy to handle
these are may be minor but the quality of the case has deteriorated and the price has not gone down
i wont buy anymore of this style and will look for a better made case  its just ok and it is disappointing to see the decline in qualityi like that i can store a lot of cds in a closable wallet thats not too big  cds tall
however i do like to have some order to my cds and that means pulling them out of their sleeves and refiling them as the pages are not movablenot attractive for display but it does the job and holds everythingfeels flimsy but adequate for archiving dvdsit is a little flimsy but works for household storage
would not use it if i was on the go or in the car with kidsthe zipper is a pia
jeweled cases will not fit
nice idea to add pages
i guess for the price it is okif your looking to pare down the space your cd collection occupies this is a great solutioni bought this same product a few years ago
needed another one so i ordered the exact same thing
its super functional and all that
but this version is cheaper quality than the old one
previous version had pretty good pleather feel all the way around
the new version now has a cheaper feeling pleather for the coverbinder and the zip lining is now cheap nylon instead of the pleather
definitely lower quality not as nice looking
functionality still goodi am not as happy with the new designlike the older much betterthere was better quality in the old onesive purchased cases from case logic before and they have been really nice material that just seems very durable but this case has a very thin cover and side material
time will tell if this lastshave used case logic for years
somewhat disappointedthis media storage wallet does not have the same quality we have come to expect with case logic productsdiane says we can make it workbut outer cover is just vinylnot woven fabric we like from older itemsi guess for the pricethis is okbut i was pleased to see other case logic items we purchased were of better qualityamazon experience was great as usualjust got this and it seems nice enough at first glance but it appears to have one fatal flaw
the material fastening the zipper to the binder cover is cheapo crap so if you use this binder to lug your cds around be prepared for this to rip eventually and the zipper to become nonfunctional
i havent yet filled this one up with cds but it seems so far that the zipper is less functional than my older case logic binders that are sturdy and have not caused any buyers remorse
at the moment i am wishing that i had purchased the slightly more expensive case logic enw nylon binder because the pictures on amazon for the enw show that it doesnt have this flaw
given that the superior model is only a few bucks more case logic should consider pulling the plug on the ksw to avoid tarnishing their wellearned reputationanother disappointment which may not be a concern for you is that most of my cd booklets didnt fit comfortably into the pockets i had to jam them in if they would fit at all
on the other hand smaller pockets probably help to keep the cds more snug and less likely to wander outas far as people complaining about the brown stitching omg
do you keep your cd binder on a pedestal in your living room with spotlights showing it off
or do your friends express horror at the stitching when you bring the binder to their place
if so you may want to find new friends consider seeing a psychologist to help you find enough meaning in your life that the color of the stitching on your cd binder is not something to complain aboutoverall very nice product
plenty of storage space and the sheets can be moved in and out with easemy main problem is the zipper
seems like others have had the same issue
its a bit of a struggle to get it to zip up once youre done
if youre not accessing it constantly its fine
but if this is something youll be opening on a frequent basis id look for better qualitylike other reviewers for this product my case arrived without a removable sleeve
the case still works and its ok in quailty
not improved though
i also own several of the same item that i purchased years ago before the brown stitching and they are a heavier gauge koskin material and paddingim not surprised that the improvement was taking the good quality out of their product
since the economy tanked makers from foods to dryer sheets to coffee to tshirts are all making their products as cheaply as possible to save money or raising their prices
case logic and this cddvd case is no different
works ok but dont expect the same good quality as before
i emailed amazon about the missing sleeve and asked them to either change the product description or ship the correct item they described to future buyersamazon as always wins out on price and shipping
the zipper is a bit stiff will wait and see what happens
i will subsequently post what happens with the zipper
i find it a bit disappointing that amazon offered no refills
what a great way to increase a sale
no information on the proper refill either
i have found that amazon is often on their game suggesting additional accessories
after several hours of research i found the refills available at the manufacturer
i had to use a third party to find out the correct refillnot crazy about the cheap vinyl covering and sticthingthe sleeves work very well with a good quality zipperthe older case logics have much better sticthings and a nylon coveringdont pay to much for this product
i recommend the targus brand httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbisjhrefohdetailsosiieutfpscescases if your looking a inexpesive cd casei purchased this  cddvd case from case logic to store dvds for my employer
each week  dvds are made of lectures and these are supposed to be put into storage in case someone ever wants to review them
hardly anyone ever requests them but they must be available and in a convenient place if someone asks for them
i order this cddvd case because it holds a good amount of discs it should take at least nine months before i have to order another one
also i have purchased items from case logic in the past and they have been of a fairly decent quality
the case is easy to use and it does make storing all these random dvds easy to do
however the case is not made with very sturdy materials
its actually rather flimsy in that regards and i was rather disappointed by this
overall the  cddvd case from case logic will do in a pinch but youre better off spending a little more money and getting something thats better qualitythis case doesnt seem to be as well made as older case logic designs
it works well as intended for now but time will tell if its durable or not
this shouldnt stop you from buying the product im just saying that its construction isnt as solid as other case logic cases that i have owned in the pastpackage came on time and was what was expected so i am happy with the transaction and have been using the producti bought this because i wanted a compact fitinyourpocket camera and it is that
the integrated lens cap is just great
but be warned  this camera has a few significant to me anyway limitations
first its basically only good as a snapshot camera in fairly bright light
it simply cant focus worth a darn unless theres a lot of light on the subject
this is particularly troublesome because you cant manually focus
second if you use reading glasses as this yearold reviewer does then keep em around  you need to decipher small icons on the small lcd to control the camera
better keep the manual handy too
hmmm those reading glasses and manual make the camera a big less portable
third if you ever want to take closeups then youve got to use the macro zoom function  but after hours of trying for the life of me i cant make it work worth a darn
that said the camera is quite nice for daylight shots
id be inclined to buy the underwater housing for it but underwater shots are by their nature lowlight
the battery charger is very cool  the battery slips into a cartridge which plugs into the wallthe sound of this player is great
i do suggest that you replace the headphones
i opted for the sony headphones that hang on each ear rather than ear buds or a head band
once you have good headphones you will be amazed at the range and clarity of sound this little device produces
it has enough memory to listen to high quality mps for two hours
the screen is a bit hard to read
they sacrificed functionality for fashion by using an oval shaped screen
many times i find myself looking into the window at an angle so i can see the full song name
the controls are easy to use and you can skip songs or pause the player without having to look at the buttons
the negative side of this player is reliabilityi loved this player when first purchased
after listening to the preloaded songs i deleted all files and loaded it exercise music
 days later i was ready to change music and used rio audio manager to transfer files
it was only able to access the first  meg
anything further was a corrupted file
i reinstalled the firmware hoping to fix the problem
now nothing but the firmware installer will access my rio
on three different computers i get the same symptoms
rio audio manager looks for device
rio audio manager crashes
same problem with siren by sonic foundry the first program i used to download files to the player
even the microphone will not record into memory
after research i find many people are having problems with this player
i made the most common mistake of the digital age
dont buy any device or software when it first hits the market
a lot of people are having problems with the rio  the company should have done more test before releasing the productthree starts for the improvements introduced in in later versionsoriginal one star review text followsi would create a zero stars category
 days of linksys products operation and tech support activities related to this device included a support technician telling me over the phone maybe you dont know enough about computers to be setting up a home network this adapter crashed windows xp when connected via a usb  port on an expansion card it worked fine when connected via the motherboards usb  port the linksys tech who made the comment above was not the one who figured this out guess who did
 it took two weeks of daily tweaking including multiple instances of key string reentry to get the bit wep to work
 days after purchase the wub wireless adapter failed
linksys promised an rma via email in  hours
it took four days and three additional phone callsif you are still in the product selection phase avoid linksys like the plague
i will never consider them for a future home or business solution and will never recommend them to anybody in the market for homesmall office wireless solutionsmake sure you are purchasing the  or  version  and  will not work with tivo units
amazon does not clearly list the different versionsi was forced to buy this thing because tivo is too cheap to make a box that can use g
adding a b to your network forces the wireless hub to work at b speed
for you technowhizzes you can set up separate networks but for plug and play people this thing is a square peg in a round holeedit  tivo now runs with g
there is no reason to buy this product any morei have three different types of wireless adapters  two by linksys and one by netgear
none of them are perfect but if all is right with the world and your computer this one is relatively easy to install and usually works well signalwise particularly with a booster on your router bought the linksys booster for their wireless router and there was a huge improvement with all of these devicestake note of the installation procedures since each os has different steps to follow
on a few computers the software doesnt seem to install but actually does
and once in a while windows decides it doesnt recognize it and you might have to go through the whole installation again if unplugging it and plugging it back in doesnt work
as i said quirky but they all arethis system is great
range is ok tech support was ok no complaints
i must say that is a few other companies sold this type of device the price would be much lower seems like it should cost about  not 
amazons price was the best i found and shipping was fast 
thanks amazoncomthis product works great for me until i pick up my new  ghz phone and it kills every one of these linksys wireless adpaters in the house i had  i can use any of the mhz phones with no problem but if you have or plan to get ghz wireless products you better stay away from this
i finally gave up and wired my house and solved the problem its a great product otherwisethis adapter only supports up to bit wep and the usb interface means convenience but your computer will also slow down when theres heavy traffic
you can pickup a wirelessg adapter pci is better for about the same pricethis device works as advertised you can use it where you would expect to
we use ours on our tivo series   hour device
works great there
setup was painlesssometimes we see some packet loss or some lag and thats where the complaints start
this device works well for loss tolerant situations but i wouldnt dare put my pc or my laptop on it
the signal quality isnt what you need and youll drop more packets and hence lose speed and waste time than you care toso for something like a tivo this is great
for something like your home pc or laptop keep shoppingi own this adaptor for  years its version  the cable has same style plug both sidesi use xp driver install is easy just follow the special instruction for xp usersit has excellent reception  meters more distance than other pc card adpatorsbut it has severe problem that it disconnect and reconnect every several minutes under low reception makes bad lagging espcially when listening streaming radio and watching streaming video this is very annoyingother that the antenna is so fragile luckily the reception dont change when in recessed position probably because of its plastic finishif youre planning to get it for xp get ms mnusb instead the reception is not as good as this but no lag problemthis was most likely an error due to not knowing what it was i neededi had a laptop with a wireless card and i needed to broadcast the signal to it from my desktop so i could be connectedturns out i was mistaken  this is not what i neededhowever amazon made the return process very easy and convenient and i will shop again someday when the need arisesthe linksys wirelessb router is a handy little device whos time has in many ways passedin terms of setup and software it is a cinch run the software and plug it in and presto it found my wireless network and had me surfing in no time much to the delight of my wife who didnt want more wires running through the housethe downside of this device is security
the only security available currently on this device is wep which although was good at the time of the initial release of the device doesnt cut it today
linksys has not offered a firmware upgrade to allow wpapsk and from two conversations ive had with them doesnt seem to have plans to do sothis means your system will be hackable by even the sloppiest hacker
you would be much better off going with a later model that includes native or upgradable wpapsk supportof course if you dont mind people hacking your system then this will certainly do the job
if you are doing any kind of home business or keeping financial records on the pc id give it a missthe configuration utilities that ship with linksys wireless products will not installrun properly on winxp linksys requires you to use the winxp wireless zero configuration wzc service
one feature of wzc is that once every minute it will drop the current signal in search of a better one resulting in constant annoying interruptions to your online play
thus if you try to use linksys wireless products for online gaming prepare to be very annoyed
otherwise the product seems to work fine for normal web browsingthe one i ordered never worked
im running xp so i just plugged it into the usb port and nothing happened
called up technical support excellent service a couple of time and they said that it must be a faulty unit
i wouldnt avoid linksys products though bucause their service was excellent and i have a router from them that works greative used this product for about  months or so and was a bit disappointed with the signal strength of my computer connected to the adapter after the first hour of using it each time
when you first plug in the adapter to the network its signal strength is described as quotexcellentquot
not too long after it drops to quotgoodquot to quotpoorquot in a matter of  minutes
after that such time the signal would constantly cease to work but then to kick back up to the quotpoorquot signal strength every few minutesi would have to make the prediction that my router and adapter are no further than  ft apart and one floor difference in my house
the product details on this site describe it to having ft range
i would expect that the signal strength would not fade to minimal or none after viewing that description but after short usage or minimal intereference ie
a person walking by the adapter the signal should not but does lose most if not all its signal strengthhowever a month ago i decided to try using the linksys wirelessb signal booster wsb in the attempt to boost my signal to the adapter
it was an extremely easy quotpiggybackquot set up to my wireless router and wouldnt you know it the adapter has been working like a charm ever since
the average signal strength is now mostly quotvery goodquot every now and then rising to quotexcellentquot or falling to quotgoodquoti give this product  stars because it probably works great  ft or less from the router to the adapter but its irritating and aggravating that i have to spend more money and more time to improve this products performance  for a booster
unfortunately i dont think amazon sells this product anymore
i got mine at circuit citydid the job but had to unplug and plug the device back in at least once a day to get it reconnected
tried new drivers firmware updates but no changethe toshiba sd dvd player is a successor to a wellknown sd
for a reasonable price it features parallel video output and dvdr playbacklooksi dont understand what is wrong with toshiba but they continue to produce dvd players that look plain and cheap
if you dont think so please do not read the previous sentence
oh well at least the looks do not influence performancethe frontpanel design has only buttons for basic functions everything else is performed through the remote controlsetupsetup is quite easy assisted by toshibas first setup menupicture and soundboth picture and sound quality are excellent
the picture quality is great when the player is connected to the tv with an svideo cable to avoid moire patterns
toshiba claims the player features  lines of horizontal resolution
the sd also makes a good cd playervideo outsthe player has the composite svideo outputs and colorstream component jacks
the best way to connect dvd player to tv is to use componentvideo outputs if you have a tv that has this type of input since this method bypasses both tvs comb filter and color decoderhowever difference in quality with svideo connection is negligible so svideo is secondbest method of connection
it allows you to bypass tvs comb filter the device that separates chrominance and luminance from the composite video signal and avoid rainbowlike moire effects which happen when the comb filter mistakes luminance for color informationthe difference between picture quality using composite video connection and svideo is apparent especially on tvs with cheap comb filters
and even d comb filters have problems with moving images so svideo is much better and allows you to bypass comb filter and feed the separate chrominance and luminance information directly to your tvs color decoderthe player has a feature called parallel video out that allows you to watch the movie on several tvsmonitors at once by connecting to them using svideo component colorstream and composite outspluge allows the player to pass blackerthanblack signals to your tv than needed eliminating the gray color in places where the black color should be
you can see how blacklevel expansion works from my reviewaudio outstoshiba invented optical digital audio out which is why it is sometimes called toslink
surprisingly sd does not have it but rather features dolby digital and digital theater sound dts compatible digital coaxial output
which provides the same sound quality easier connection and allows you to use cheaper cable with rcatype jacksnote with coaxial digital audio out it is recommended to use a cable that is designed to transfer composite video signal since the bandwidth used is very similarthe player also has analog left and right audio out rca type
to get surround sound you can either connect analog out to dolby pro logic equipment or use coaxial digital out with dolby digital or dts decoder
or you can either use stereo sound from the analog audio out using spatializer feature when appropriatethe sd features dialogue enhancement mode which boosts the center speaker sound level
the player is also cdtext compatiblefeaturesthe player has other standard dvd features parental control cdaudio playback camera angle select multilanguage and multisubtitle select spatializer n virtual surround sound
but it also has some advanced features power zoom x playback x x and x slow scan x x x x forward and reverse highspeed scan and time search title stopremotethe remote is reasonably sized with good button layout  leftright and updown buttons are centrally placed with the enter button in the middlebottom linethe sds looks can be contested but the performance and features make it a good choice
however there are better choices in the same price rangeive had this model and the equivalent panasonic rv and give the edge to the panasonicboth are good dvd players for nondigital tvs particularly if the tv accepts colorstream component input
both have nice pictures and colorstream component output
neither has progressive scan which you probably wont notice unless you have a digital tv
both have miscellaneous features like quotaudio enhancequot a sound mode that tries to play dialoge at extra volume
both seem reasonably reliable and supposedly play audio cds and mp files
both are supposed to have some problems with computerburned cds howeverultimately though the panasonic rv is worth the extra  bucks
the controls are significantly easier to use with a jog wheel on the console and easy framebyframe advance and reverse
the other reports ive seen say that the panasonic is significantly better with scratched dvds which is important for renters like methe product serves the purpose for which i bought and syncs well with my computerit has cute features to usei really miss my axim
this does the same things but not the way im used to
it does have a background lighting feature that helps to read in direct lightthis palm is ok but not as great as a more expensive higher end like m product
when using the palm sd scrabble card in this level of palm the board does not display like the real scrabble board
it works but one must consult the info legend for which characters represent the tiles for triple word double word double letter etc
it is ok and the best that could happen in a non color setting
but the m color works better because it will display the actual scrabble boardthe m was my second pda  the first being a palm pilot so old it didnt warrent a number and as thick as a deck of cardsthe m was leaps and bounds over the early model but so was a franklin planneri was being cheap  and didnt go for the m
it was only a little more but didnt have the color of a sony or compaq
i do not know what the m now sells form was a nice pda but the backlighting was beyond bad
i should have returned it but a crowbar in my wallet and upgraded  but i didntfunctionwise the m did its work and had no system issues
the documentstogo is ok though supposedly you cant create new files
of course there were workarounds to that  like putting in a word or excel template and doing a save as renaming and presto  youre creating a documentmy opinion  spend the money
the tungsten t is becoming more and more affordable and a good purchase  and it is what i upgraded to after the m
i would suggest that
i have also reviewed that modelhowever if youre looking for a monochromatic screen  the m might be the puchase for youtenia una palm vx la cambie por el nuevo modelo palm m esperando encontrarme con una agenda mucho mejor pero no fue asi este modelo a pesar de ser a color no es atractivo a la vista no ofrece nada nuevo ni mejoras sustanciales a lo que ya se tenia en la vx
ademas de que muchos de los programas ya existentes para la palm vx no funcionan correctamente o no son compatibles con esta palm m
despues de esta decepcion mejor me cambie a las pocket pc ipaq
en mi experiencia personal si ya tienes una palm vx no vale la pena la inversion en este nuevo modelo de palm yo preferiria conservar mi palm vx
mucho dinero por pocos cambiosantoniobeing new to the palm universe i purchased this for its small size it easily slides into a shirt pocket and the fact that my boss has the same model
beaming him address items and schedule changes has made life a bit easier
however its small size was a factor on why i chose the palm m over a handspring visorunlike some many
users here i have had no problem synching the device to my pc and my mac
installing the sw and synching has been a breeze
the palm  desktop os is also a straightforward program thats easy to navigateive also dropped the device on occasion and thankfully my data remained intactmy only gripe is the lack of screen contrast  brightness controls
without the builtin light the screen can be hard to see in lowlight conditions
with the builtin light turned on the screen is easy to see although it wears down your batteries more quickly
i have learned to live with this flaw and will not purchase a new palm anytime soonpalm just released the m which has those screen controls
unless you can get a better deal on the m i recommend the newer model if you are really concerned about the screen brightnessupdate in january  my m suddenly was unable to sync with my pc
after a few emails and phone calls to palm i learned that this model and the m are prone to hotsync failures due to static electricity
shipping the m to palm and a quick hotsync with the backedup data on my pc fixed the problem
the m was back in my hands in less than a week and the only cost to me was for shippingi never thought id use the palm iii when i first got it
it wasnt until i began inputting directly from the computer and hot synching that i began to grow in love and then use the darn thing continuallywhen the  first came out i got it for  the color screen the option to add more memory i told you i use it a lot and the rechargable batterythe color screen is the opening one
come on palm you couldnt provide us with color on the date book or the calendar
adding the memory card is almost too easy and it works
adding an ebook or a memory hog like vindigo which has to weekly update is now a nonissue
there is plenty of room for addons and expansionsbut palm has made no attempt to resolve issues like back lighting and the difficult writing method palm is suppose to useso if you use your palm for everything and dont mind the limited color programs this palm is for youthe m is best summarized as an incremental product for palm not revolutionary
it is certainly not the wow product the original palm v was but merely ok here is a quick snapshotpros display  yes a pro and a con depending on whether you compare it to the palm v or sony cliecompaq ipaq
despite its shortcomings i still feel it is better in most lighting conditions than my green screen palm v it is easier on the eyes and the backlight is more useable in transitional lighting
performance  faster than the palm v on all accounts and display performance screen draws is better than m which is why i choose the m over the m not because of color
palm os  stable easy and thousands of simple yet powerful applications
and if you dont think it has breadth beyond a date book look harder office apps project plans pocket quicken photos access databases etc
all on my little palm
size  small and light
it is a true pocket pc
expansion  supports tiny sd and mmc cards
why i choose m over the better display on sony clie
i did not want to be committed to sony only memory stick versus more industry standard sd
even new ipaq supports sd cards
if you already have sony memory stick devices by all means check out the clie
memory  relative to us palm v users with only mb memory
for me extra mb in the m and bigger flash memory too was a huge incentive to upgrade now rather than wait for what will hopefully be a much improved display on next palm
battery life  without the backlight weeks not hours and even with much needed backlight i have gone days without cradling it to recharge
your mileage may vary cons display  disappointing
i think palm should have worked harder on getting resolution and brightnesscontrast right rather than worrying about k washed out colors
it could have been a wow product
and dont tell me they couldnt have done it without huge sacrifices to size and battery life
sony came closer
palm clearly focused on making it better than the palm vvx rather than focusing on the competitive pocket pc threat particularly the ipaq
yes the m is smaller and battery life is better but when people put the ipaq next to the m palm loses sales
period
universal connector  two accessories i connect to this device so far the usb cradle and travel synch cable fit the connector horribly
the m is difficult to seat in the cradle no matter how much i use it and the travel synch cable is an extremely loose connection
availability of accessories  not very many even though m has been out since may and what few are out are still hard to find at many retailersrecommendation if you need the expansion more memory coming from a palm v like me and small size is a big plus for you versus a m this is still a worthy upgrade
but do not switch based solely on color display
you will be disappointed
i even considered moving to the dark side for a better display and i have been a loyal palm user since the pilot  what kept me
there are still key palm advantages simplestable palm os selection of applications and sizebattery life
however consider a discounted purchase as this device may move quickly to the clearance rack if palm comes out with a much improved color model anytime sooni compared the m to my compaq ipaq and palm iiic over the weekend and had some comments to make along with everybody else about the controversial screen issuei compared the ipaq and the  sidebyside and without the backlight on the  looks to be about the same as the powersave mode on the ipaq maybe a little brighter but im not even sure about that
the powersave mode on the ipaq uses no backlight illumination at all which basically means that the  is no better than the ipaqs screen on the th and lowest power settingit does look better with the backlight on though
the ipaq has five different settings for the screen powersave mode low medium high and superhigh brightness
the  looks to be somewhere between the ipaqs low and mediumintensity modes
if it gets to medium on the ipaq its definitely no brighter than that and the high and superhigh settings are very bright
at these settings theres no comparison between the  and the ipaq
on superhigh mode the ipaq looks several times brighter than the if i have any complaint about the ipaq screen its that it looks somewhat milky on medium or high intensity but its brighter than the  even with the s backlight on
however the ipaq like the  is also visible in direct sunlight due to the partially backreflective screen capabilityi also compared it to my iiic which i have had for  months and am quite fond of
the screen is so bright at full brightness you can use it for a flashlight in a dark room
someone once humorously remarked you could use it to signal alien flying saucers which it just about isanyway the iiic is definitely easier to read indoors
i tested it in a best buy store under fairly bright officelighting conditions and without the backlight on the iiic is noticeably brighter
the  is visible outside in the sun however where the iiic would wash out
however in the store i looked at them side by side with the screens facing the front of the store where the sunlight was coming in and even then the iiic was still easier to see than the  even with the backlight oni tried this test with several other people at the counter who were also interested in the  and we all agreed the iiic was still the winner
there were  or  of us there and we all discussed the pros and cons of the unit and the overall consensus seemed to be that you would have to use the backlight on all the time
with it on however most people felt the screen was tolerable although not great and an older woman who i was discussing the unit with decided to buy one right there as the store was having a memorial day sale and was offering it at a very attractive pricei dont own a handspring prizm but ive checked out the screen and even here theres no comparison between the  and the prizm
the prizm is much brighter
its not brighter than the iiic as has been claimed ive compared both screens side by side also but its certainly equal to it
so if youre disappointed in the m you might want to check out the prizm
the prism also offers k colorsusing the backlight on all the time does allay many of the criticisms about the screen as it is substantially brighter with it on but then that will tap into your power and defeats the supposedly longerlife battery of the  compared to the iiic
the one thing where the m was the clear winner though was in the speed area
it is noticeably faster than my palm iiic which i find to be perfectly acceptable
the screen refreshes on the m are really fast maybe even faster than my ipaq but i wouldnt swear to it
in any case the greater speed of the  is a big improvement over all earlier palmsit seems to me that the decision to buy or not to buy this particular palm is going to be a highly individual one
im not ready to buy one yet as i find i still prefer the brighter screen on the iiic despite the much greater speed of the m
but if i the iiic didnt exist id probably buy the  if it was the only way to get colorfirst reaction on using the new m is that it looks sexy has a great screen and will offer major improvements over its predecessors
unfortunately it does not live up to that expectationfor the money the older v series offers everything significant but the color screen and i actually found the screen on the v to be easier to read
and since that v is now less than the m its a no braineri dont think that palm put in enough new features to justify the expense
its all sizzle and no steak
save your money and keep your old palm or buy the v series and put money into your pocketthe reigning king of pdas at least for now
the device comes with mb of memory  and a small removable storage slot for additional space  more than enough room for phone numbers appointments and applications
the color screen is crisp and clear though the backlighting is fairly dim
in addition the m rates high on the coolness scale with a sleek design that rivals gadget king sony
still the price is steep
and with recent introductions of a new generation of pdas by hp sony and compaq the ms time at the top may be waning
if you can find the right price i say go for iti was not impressed with the auto focus  to big for my purposes
would not recommend for close up bird watching on patioi purchased this gpsmap because it was one of the models that would allow me to load free maps of mn snowmobile trail system
if youre thinking of buying one for this here are some things to consider  first i have never used a gps for this purpose so i was not sure what to expect but the mn dnr snowmobile trail map file can download for free from their website is not too bad
ive ridden about  miles with this gps now and have found a few instances where the map is out of date
thats no fault of the gps just local clubs not keeping the dnr informed of changes
unlike auto gps which is pretty intuitive there is a learning curve to this thing so you should be prepared to spend several hours playing with it to get the hang of it before you intend to actually use it
its best to turn off all functions that you dont really need to keep the screen from being cluttered
turn off the map that it comes with so that only the snowmobile map is shown
you will absolutely need to zoom inout often so get very aquainted with that feature
i keep my zoom set   miles while im riding to show when a curve or small variation in the trail is coming up
then when i get to a intersection and im not sure which way to go i zoom out to about  miles which means that you actually have about a x mile map on the screen so you can see towns and which trail leads where make sure you have the town setting turned on
you will need to carefully think of howwhere to mount this because you need it mounted very very solid if you expect to read it while youre moving not to mention keeping it from flying off
i first mounted mine on the dash behind the windshield but found that it was too far away to see and had to always lean ahead uncomfortably to push buttons etc
then i made a mount for the handlebars so that its right in front of me and i can look at the screen straighton
much better but again that mount absolutely must be rocksolid
i had to make my own mount because i could not find anything solid enough
have a metalfab guy make a mount for you using a pipeclamp not hose clamp for the handlebars
my only real complaint about the gps itself is that i wish the screen was easier to see at times there is still a glare depending on how the sun is shining  oh by the way i dont often ride at night but if you dothe backlight on this unit can be set to stay on for a maximum of just a few minutes so youll have to keep pushing the light button to keep the screen visible at night saves battery life i guessi just purchased two ceiva quotinternetenabled photo framesquot as gifts for my technicallychallenged relations
the idea is fantastic send them this frame as a gift and allow them access to a constant stream of  digital photos showing family activities etc
from a different part of the  countrythe execution of the above idea is somewhat less than perfect
i had one of the frames shipped to my house to personally set up and  observe functionality  the other one was shipped directly to the more  technicallyadept family member
after setting up the frame easy and  connecting to ceiva easy i found out that you have to log in to their  web site and create an account and grant permissions to be able to receive  pictures from someone else  using the information enclosed in the ceiva  packaging someone needs to have internet access
one of the frame  recipients currently has no internet access while the other would be  challenged by the ceiva web site and setup
once i had activated the  account i was then able to send pictures to it and eventually to the  framesafter the pictures  at a time were downloaded to the frame i  discovered that the picture quality of the frame is only fair
the  pictures come across as washed out with muted colors
i have tried  playing with darkness and contrast settings both on their site and using my  own photo editing software and have found that a brighness reduction of   seems to help
i guess im spoiled in that i own a top of the line sgi  flat screen monitor and am used to high resolution and brilliant colors  i  had set up the test ceiva frame in my home office right next to the   monitor  yes i realize that were talking a x price differential here   im just trying to optimize the available picture qualityin fairness  to ceiva once the more technicallyadept relation had received her frame  she was able to connect it and make it work with no input from me after i  had set up her account and loaded it with pictures
she is delighted with  the new pictures we have uploaded and looks forward to more and is happy  to have some quotst century technologyquot in her homein summary  i like the idea of being able to send digital images to family members  without having to act as a  oncall help desk
if ceiva would improve  the picture quality of this unit id raise my rating to  stars
despite this shortcoming my relations enjoy their ceivas and the digital  pictures brought to themthe idea is very clever and the frame is very easy to use and set up
i object to having to pay a fee to access a web site where i can upload my pictures to
after all i have just spent a small fortune on this device why on earth should i have to pay to use itthat said i did know it  before i purchased it
anyway the screen quality is good  if you view it  from the right angle
otherwise it fades
also your pictures must be  x pixels otherwise you get a border around it
if you crop your  photos remember to resize them to avoid thisi had trouble getting the  timer to work
i set it i thought to switch off at  pm and on again  at  am but it remained on all night
so i switch it off manually  nowthe only other products right now that come close to this cost a lot  more
sony has a solution that you can plug direcly into your pc  which is nice
and theres also a product called digiframe by a vendor of  the same name that has a changeable frame for the picture and offers   sizes of frame as well as the directtopc cableoverall its early days for  this technology
i think that the quality of the screen will improve so  that you will be able to view from any angle
i think the price will come  down  eventually
the biggest drawback for this product is the  internetconnection requirement and the fact that if you want to replace  the photographs in your frame its a quotmust havequotanother note   be careful to ensure you have a local access number for ceiva near you
if you do not then its a longdistance call or a call to their  number  for you ceiva to get internet access to download
this costs morea good  gimmick
a conversation piece
a great gift idea when youre out of ideasall in all the plugs for other countries are good but the connector to the palm is my only complaintit does not seem to connect well and you have to set it a certain way for it to stay connectedif you travel you still need thisi bought this little unit because ive purchased netgear products before a port hub and a k modemrouter combo
the biggest thing i hated about the rp was the interface
the http interface only allowed you to configure some of the routers settings
the telnet interface while more complete didnt have the content filtering section or the dhcp listing that the http interface had
maybe i just didnt see in the telnet interface this is entirely possible
i was used to using winroute pro a software router which is so easy to setup that going from it to the netgear router was a step backwardseven more than having to go into two different interfaces to configure the router the filtering and port forwarding setup was so confusing
it took me days to figure out how to open the web and ftp ports
in my research for help in this area the netgear site was unuseful
i did find many other people with the same questions and finally found one answer on someone personal website on how to do things properly
keep in mind i didnt read the router manual and as far as im concerned i shouldnt have to
i do believe the router can do anything you want it to do which is why i gave it  stars
i also believe youll have a hard time configuring the router to do what you want it to do which is why it didnt get  starsi ended up returning the rp router and replacing it with the siemens speedstream port dslcable router
it was cheaper and the interface was incredibly easy
it only comes with two ports but i have hubs so no big deal
and to top it off the internet connection was faster using the speedstream rather than the rp
i did notice when i was trying to fix my open port problem with the rp that many commented that the router slowed their internet access speeda diferencia de lo facil de colocar la palm vx en su base de transferencia de datos y carga de energia esta base para la  serie palm m es bastante dificil de colocar ademas de lo dificil tambien de separar despues de su uso
por que un sistema tan complicado para algo tan sencilloantoniowith the introduction of the new palm mx series palm needed to make a whole different type of quotuniversal connectorquot with this new quotuniversal connectorquot we get a new fangled cradlepalms explanation for a new cradle and a new connector was to give true usb support to the cradle
lets not forget that well have to buy all new accessories to cater to the new quotuniversal connectorquot the question i ask is quotis it new functionality or new sales theyre afterquotenough about my rant on the universal connector
lets get to the cradle itself
its different that the palm v cradle i compare it to the palm v cradle since the mx series is just following in the footsteps of that series
first it isnt slide in and out like the old cradle
to take the palm out you have to lift up then pull vertically up
to put it in you have to put it in vertically fumble around a bit then once you hear the palm beep you can nestle it back in the cradlefor people who dont know about the above process im guessing youre going to break your palm so be warnedonce you get the process down it actually becomes second nature
granted i think its a cumbersome process but the unit stays in the cradle securelyone issue that made me knock this cradle down to three stars and this could be in conjunction with the palm itself but sometimes the unit doesnt charge fully in the cradle
you place the palm in the cradle the palm makes the beep and you think youre charging right
you take it out th enext morning go to work and then you notice that your battery indicator is still int he same position
whats up with that
ive discovered that for the unit to fully charge and sometimes hotsync correctly you have to make sure the connection to the cradle is flushthe product does give usb support so the cradle does have a functionality
for me personally i wish palm didnt have to give us a new quotuniversal connectorquot every couple of yearsthis product works but palm is no longer a companysometimes the palm doesnt fit quite rightthere are no drivers for windows  for the usb sync cablehonestly  if you need a pda i would recommend buying a cheap smart phonecompared with the flimsy flipface that comes with the m systems this is beautiful but overkillthe zippered leather case is wellpadded and protects the m well
with a little creative positioning you can still get the m into its cradle without having to remove it from the cases compartment a real timesaver
however the multiple pockets for the expansion cards are somewhat useless how many mseries owners do you know with sd cards coming out their ears
im a geek and i only own the one i bought with the system
 and as a wallet theres not enough pockets here to move stuff over from your pocketbookthis is a nice case but its not perfect either
get rid of the pockets and keep the padding and drop the price
still if you want to protect your investment in your m palm dont trust that flimsy flip face this is a much better ideai am not a pro photographer but my family and i enjoy taking photos of our adventures and gatherings
late last year i decided to take the plunge
after reading reviews online and visiting best buy to actually feel the camera in my hands i opted for the olympus camedia  after using it a year i would say it is a decent but not great camera and that for basic pictures in good lighting it works well
it fits well in the hand is very light and portable and if you have never taken digital photos before it is a real kick to see your work on your pc right after you shoot the photosthe rub is that digital cameras and this one is no exception do not work at all well in lower lighting with the flash
you tend to get too bright and harsh images in the foreground and blackness in the background
you have to go up in price to get some correction for this
and as other reviewers have noted the time lag between depressing the button and waiting for the picture to be copied to the card is longish
forget snapping a quick sequence of photos
and forget the manual
it was written by some tech geeks at olympia who do not have a clue how to write clear simple direct instructions or how to design a clear simple menuing system for the camera
it took me a half hour to figure out how to delete a photo using the led menuthis is just a personal note you have to slide the lens cover over to use the camera and then the lens extends itself
you snap the cover back to the edge of the lens and it retracts and you can close the lens cover
while this is nice to protect the lens it got really annoying to me over time and i longed for a simple camera with a simple lens coverthe pictures can be very vivid even spectacular in their resolution but sometimes the colors can be a little harshi suggest that if you want to take basic pics in day light or well lit rooms this is a decent little camera and the price will only keep getting lower
plan on getting a higher memory card a battery recharger kit and rechargeable batteries the card reader to hook up to your pc works like a charm and download your own photo editing softwareif you want more advanced features better imaging and better performance in dim light you will have to go up in pricei owned this camera for awhile its good actually very goodbut the zoom wasnt what i wanted so i upgraded to a nikon only because im use to a camera that behaves like a slrbut if you do purchase this olmpyus and your a average photo type user or not into tecnical cameras that can be difficult then this is the camera for youthis is the same camera as the d but with a nice  optical zoom
that addresses the most glaring shortcoming of the d but adds a very significant premium to the price 
in this price and performance range id much prefer the olympus stylusbased d
i have appended my review of the d  this is my first olympus digital but it will not be my last
it is a very nice beginners purchase and would also make a very good backup for a more dedicated digital photographer
the size and weight make it a breeze to carry in a pocket purse or glove compartment
it has good quality optics a  megapixel resolution that will allow pretty good quot x quot prints good battery life and can use readily available alkalines and easy usb connectivity to your pc for transferring images
the included  meg card is adequate though it seems to me this camera which when attached to your pc is automatically recognized as another drive a nice feature requiring no software installations would have benefited from some onboard memory
furthermore i do not like cameras that require using the lcd panel to view amp frame the image much preferring a traditional throughthelens viewfinder which is absent on the brio
however its most glaring shortcoming is the lack of an optical zoom it has a digital zoom but these are vastly inferior digital tricks that halve the resolution while doubling the size of the selected portion of the photographed image but if thats not a problem for you youll be happy with the rather handsome brioi think it must be the fault of  that these things have such poor range
my stupid mhz cordless phone goes all the way to the neighbors house yet this thing wont go from the office to the living room i could probably do infrared from the office to the living room without losing  of its signal strengththat said it was easy to setup though it didnt have dhcp capability so required me to set an ip address and it would have been better if they had allowed me to configure it via the net rather than a usb cable since its on top of a tall bookshelf on the end of a  net cable to get rangebut that said its a pretty solid piece of hardware and works flawlessly within the confines of the standardafter a huge initial hassle i got this up and running and it has worked well since
i bought this some time ago i think it was pretty newly released and the documentation had some holes in itspecifically it didnt mention that the software for the host machine was required if you wanted to set up security encryption
i was attempting to set the security without this and the two protocols being used were not matching
contacting netgear tech support was a nightmare
it took multiple emails and multiple phone calls
after about a week i finally found someone who could help and i got an answernow for the good news  once that was resolved i have not had another problem with this
in fact i even upgraded to windows xp from windows se and still had no problems
now that is impressivejust about every other piece of hardware did have troubles with xp when it was first released
so all in all i am now very happy with this access point
but it only gets  stars because it was a really bad starti had no problem setting up this access point and upgrading the firmware but my experience so far is that i have to reset the device far too often for my liking
the signal drops to the point that i loose network connectivity on my clients and no matter how many times i rescan the channels with the pccard software the signal does not return until i pull the access points power plug and put it back in
i have had to do this almost daily
when the device is not hung and needing a reset it works great
it has good signal strength and provides acceptable allaround area coverage in my home
i do think that i will save up for a higher quality product like aironet though
this being my first experience with wireless networking i would say that for the low cost i guess this one is ok i would appreciate a more reliable signal thoughi purchased this adapter for my garmin cx but dont use it because i realized that the car charger for my motorola razr phone works instead
its easier to plug in and doesnt interfere with the car mount as muchim sure this is a great product but i bought it because i got the mistaken impression that you needed it to use the garmin streetpilot
i think it was a suggestion by amazon
but the unit come with the lighter adapter so i sent it back for credit which amazon handled perfectly
so dont get it unless you want an extraim sure the item is well made and would be great if it fit but as one reviewer has stated the website encourages you to buy this for units that are not compatible
i bought this along with the cx and saw that the  series was not listed on the package
i decided to try it anyway and discovered that the pin configuration was slightly different and would not fit
i went to the garmin website and checked the part number
they too lead you to believe it will fit but i wasnt about to use a hammer to try and prove them right
at this point i dont know if there is a  volt power cord available for the cx
has anyone else had this problemthese speakers came with the dell computer my company bought for my office
theyre decent speakers but have no shielding to speak of
i cant have my cell phone even sitting idle within  feet of them lest they spit static
i had a cheap mouse for a little while that had an unshielded wire and these speakers spat static every time i moved the mouse unless i had the mouse cord far enough away from the speakers
the volume changes a lot for a small turn of the knob which is a little annoying but not critical
ive never really pushed the speakers to any loud volumes to check that end thoughtheres a reason these speakers are so inexpensive they aint so great
and theres a reason you should spend more than this on speakers you enjoy music
go elsewherei dont understand why these speakers are getting such high reviews from people
theyre ok but definitely not great
they get loud without distorting theres a decent amount of bass for their price and theyre cheap
but i think anyone would be much better off getting a slightly more expensive but better set of speakersthe following item does not do exactly what you expect it to
upon purchasing it most people seem to think that it buffers out scratches and makes the whole disk look clean on the back that is not the case
how it works i suppose can be explained by this exampleif you have a dollar bill that has some damage to it you may find it hard to get the vending machine to take it
a trick some people know is that if you take a dollar bill crinkle it up then straiten it back out on the edge of the machine sometimes you can get the machine to accept itthis device works like that it ends up streaking your disk with very obvious lines but in the end diminishes the severity of some of the other scratches
sometimes it works some times it doesnt
it depends on two things the severity of the scratches and the quality of your dvd player all being said you need a pretty nice dvd player in order for any disk that has this used on it to be readi had one of these and used it for years it saved a few of my cdsdvds but thats about all i can say with respect to ityou get what you pay for
i tried to save money and still get quality sound and i only saved only
only a few months after purchasing these theres a clicking that starts a few hours after the speakers are on and continues getting louder until i turn them off and let them cool
arghsound with old dvd cannot be adjusted higher to make then enjoyable to watch
music cd excellent sound
newer dvd ok soundi bought it mainly for the subwoofer the speakers are not giving out the best sound out there but if you dont care that much about audio in general you wont notice a difference
at least my tv has a nice subwoofer nowyou get what you pay forsound comes out of the speakersits no bose speaker systembut it didnt cost a thousand bucks eitherbought it for the officeserves the purposedont need studio quality audiorecommended by my friend and they serve their purpose just fine
no complaints
not much more to say than thatthese will work for my modest needs
they seem a little better for my gaminggrawworlds piratesflatout than my musicclassic rock but that difference could be the recordingsplayerssites or who knows
ive only had them about four hours now so no comment on durability
at under  i dont expect the world from themordered these based on other positive reviews but im not superhappy with the sound they produce
im not expecting them to be awesome based on the price alone but i bought these to avoid shipping a similar set of logitech speakers to an outoftown event im working at and while the logitechs werent all that great either these definitely dont sound as good
the woofer seems to produce decent sound but the lr speakers just sound pretty tinny
theres nothing rich about the sound quality at all
they look pretty cool and theyll do fine in a pinch but dont expect too muchsound is okay but not high quality
standard sound for a standard price
i do like the allinone volume knob featurei wont go into too much details regarding the specificities of this  sound system but will jump straight into my assessment of how it is good enough for the  some pricetag it carries at this momentfirst of all it was easy to set up
the speakers need to be connected to the subwoofer then plugged into an electric outlet
i was able to plug and play with minutes of unpackaging it
secondly it comes with a volume control that is attached to the speakers but provides enough wiring so i could conveniently switch the sound on and off without having to reach all the way to the back of my desk to the speakers
this product loses one star from my view here because the volume control is simply too sensitive
often times i might brush my palms over it causing the speakers to start blasting the audiothe cause of the second star lost is the tendency for my right side speaker to go out when the wires coming out of it are set in certain positions
the funny thing is this started persisting after  weeks of receiving it and i havent moved it since i set it up
the wiring is not very strong and a bad drop could tear it from the speakerthe subwoofer delivers bass nicely
as does the rest of the system
i still find that using earphones are much more optimal for watching videos however since the speakers have a tendency to distort the audio files if they arent of the highest quality
with music it works just fine
loud good bass mids and highs a little muffling and distortion but nothing i cant live withwhen these speakers first arrived damn was i impressed
the quality was superb and the bass rocked amazingly
for this price these speakers totally rocked
but the reason i am giving it a  is because about a month in of use the circular volume tuner thing broke and caused only the left speaker to work
although i am disappointed as to how it broke i do know the cause if it and will be fixing it soonfor the price its just unbeatable
speakers are finesoft balanced soundfor the price but wooferwoof
there si no woofer just  speaker set to  khz
it cant even pump the air even a litlle bit from the boxeven  yo
kids didnt like it
so i  found ohm  watt   incher online for  he screwed it in instead of original and kids are happy nowgreat cheap speakers if youre not too concerned with sound quality
i was kind of surprised that the satellite speakers were very muddy sounding
with the size of the speakers i was expecting more of a higher frequency out put from them
its almost as if there is no crossover control and the same full range of frequency is put out the satellite speakers and the subwoofer but the satellite speakers end up sounding like they are not e qd properly
also was expecting some sort of separate subwoofer control to dial in how much bass i wanted
however there is only one volume control for everything
this might have solved the other problemmax sound level is not very loud as long as your work area and or home office doesnt have much noise they will work alrightworked pretty well for about  months then either the power supply or the circuit board broke no visible signs on eithercracked these open and just wired em to the plug pretty quiet obviouslyi think i may have left them on all the time for awhilegot my  worth but expected more given i didnt really use them before the end of august  months inthese speakers get loud enough for a dorm roomoffice setting
they sound pretty good toomy biggest complaint and unfortunately a pretty big let down is that there is no bass adjustment on the subwooferwhich means any albumtrack with any kind of quality production is either going to be extremely bassheavy in abad way or the sub will simply buzz outits not a complete disappointment
the speakers are good most of the time
there are just some albums i cant evenlisten to because of the subpar subwooferits not as good as my previous system that finally broke down but its okay for the price i paid
if you watch movies and listen to videos it will be okay
it wont fill the room like my old one but sitting at the desk is alrightthese as we all know are budget speakers
these speakers for a computer do their job
now the sound is on my spectrum horrible
but do not let that discourage you
the  inch woofer does pound out the low frequencies
but when put on dance or even s music and the volume is over  the low freq
sounds like as a different reviewer said its coming out of a cerial box
that is very true
no depth to the sound at all
the little radiators tweeters sound not too too bad
could be better but pretty good
i got this at a different store  and my intentions in the first place is to return these
i only bought them to write a review
and of course for my pleasure to test them with other configurations
decent sound
not good sound
extremely affordable and extremely space saving
buy at your own risk
this will depend on if you really like great sound
other wise please take my advice and save your money for a different yet still very affordable  system
the logitech s
very decent sound compared to this and has bass vol
and seems of higher quality and more depth to the soundall that more and it is only about  dollars morea inch  watt speaker can not function as a subwoofer
 inches is the minimum to even come close to achieving the deep richness of music
consider the subwoofer to be a midrange accentuation piece
this is not a sub
i do not expect a computer subwoofer to rock like the one i have in my car but for goodness sakes this inch dingy is pathetic
i returned it within hours of purchasingthe satellite pieces are fine
they are very clear and tweet like they are supposed to
the satellites are what earned this item three stars
no thanks to this below par subwoofer
i think cyber acoustics does sell the satellites on their own
they would not be a bad pickup at all if you are looking to replace old satellites from another set
otherwise this is just not worth it
for five or ten dollars more get something with a legitimate subbottom line you get what you pay fori can recommend this speaker system for someone who wants a lowkey sounding system for an ipod or a laptop application
these speakers were not made for a desktop system if you are serious about good sound
i am partial to mylogitech z speaker system as they have a full range sound
the cyber acoustics leftright speakers are fine but tend towards a higher range with little midrange
the subwoofer probably the smallest i have ever seen rounds out the sound quite well with a very deep punchy bass
however the highs and the lows are good but again the midrange is missing
ill confess to being a music system junkie but this set is really for the person that just wants a stereo sound with some bass
these are not bose but then again they dont claim to be
at this price i can honestly say it is a good buy
the speakers themselves are not heavy and could bounce about on a desk but thats about the worst i can say
for the price and for the average music consumer these will do fine
the setup is typical of most systems and is easy
i can say you cant really lose here if you are not too pickysounds was ok but it was nothing spectacular
bought it  years ago and ended up giving it to a friend because i bought better speakers
then again it was  but id spend my money in one of those small speakers that connect directly to your phone probably much more useful than this product
then again if you just need something cheap this will dofirst i want to say it will work
the one in the photo on amazon is not the one i got anyway
i know i should have read it all whats the difference you ask
well this one is a  watt the one i had was  watt
the volts is the same input and dc output v
it is smaller and will have to work harder to keep the v up
that is if i understand it right
i gave it  stars because it will work but will it last as long only time will tella dvdvhs combination is a great idea for those with insufficient storage
this might have been a great buy but i am returning it after a few days of useafter playing a vhs tape for five minutes it stuck when i tried hit eject this was very annoying
i called govideo and they had a special  number for those who bought the dvr and one of their other products
i finally got through after several hours and the technician told me a way other than the manuals suggestion that you unplug the machine over night
to unjam the tape
after several tries all of which i believe may have tampered with the warranty had i damaged the machine in the attempt i finally saved an old favorite tape
the th game of the  nba championship
the govideo person said that the tape age may have had something to do with it but that in any event this should not have happened
im returning the machine even though it didnt stick with a few tapes i tried afterwards i just dont quite trust it
i had trouble getting the main setup menu to appearthis happened very inconsistentlyall that said this has great features fairly easy hookup especially for newer televisions and their customer service was very prompt and friendly
if you purchase this i hope youll have a better experience than i did
note it seems that the other dvdvhs machines have their share of problems as well read the reviews for the panasonic and especially the samsung user experiences seem to vary greatlyi have had these headphones for over  years
so you may say heck you must like them  not really
as with most things compared to nothing its better
so when i originally got these headphones and took a flight to singapore it was great
engine noise was easily cut by a third
they fold up to the size of your hand and the aaa battery last for  coast to coast flight though always bring a backup
however as i have become a more discerning listener and less willing settle the  remaining noise has grown increasingly unbearable
so these will go to auction and i am upgrading to the sony mdrnc which i have heard great things abouti got them at walmart for  what a rip off
i tried them  my mdrvs sound better
they cancel noise but i have to agree with the electronics fan
the sound is okay but not great
so i do not recommend them
they do not sound loudi bought this used cause it was a great price and came with a remote
i dont really care how the cd looks as long as it works
the problem was after about using it for the th time something snapped inside and it made a horrible noise
the sad part is i still have a  technics cd player on another stereo and it still work like its brand newim not saying sony is no good its no better or no worse then any other brand made today but buy it brand new so you get the warrantypros areeasy to usenot as bulky in height as other brandsremote includedcons areprice still  canadian new considering cd players have been out for over  years was expecting the new model to cost less then  canadian when looking for a brand new sony cd changer the other daythis unit is a basic cd changer from sony
i connected it to a sony reciever and sony speakers
song quality was what i expected its a solid sony product
the options and connectivity was limited
if i had to go back id upgrade to the next model above this one which seems to package more of sonys optionsconnectionsfeatures than this one does
read the information on the description closely and compare perhaps on sonys official website side by side to get  real feel for each of the cd options before buyingbasic  cd changer
i cannot believe however that you have to power this thing on and off manually
even at  that is just basic
sound quality is fine thoughi ordered  boxes of these cdrws
the first box had  damaged discs  when i tried to format them before using them for a backup i got a message quotdamaged or defective area on discquot  when i looked at them i could see many scratches on the shiny side not all in the same place on the discs that got this error messageon the positive side the undamaged discs work fine and the slim jewel cases do save spaceseem to scratch easyive been using this product for about three weeks
it provides basic nat routerfirewall functionality at a dirtcheap price but definitely has its limitations and problems
the problems especially require a greater knowledge of tcpip than the average home user is likely to havethe firewall functionality is very basic
having used zonealarm and internet connection sharing before getting the router i was surprised at what i lost
the router has extremely limited logging and no specific intrusion attempt logging
you also cannot block access tofrom specific external ip addresses
you can however block internal ips from internet accessive had lots of problems with bridging stability and dhcp
ive got one machine on the ethernet port and two on the phoneline network one of which is a laptop that often leaves the network
every time a machine goes off the phoneline side of the network either through shutdown or physical removal the bridging stops working
machines on the phoneline and ethernet sides can still see the internet but cannot see each other
the only way to correct this is resetting the routerthat leads to the dhcp problem
the router maintains its dhcp client table in volatile memory
therefore every time you powercycle it to fix the bridging it loses track of all ip address assignments
bringing another machine up on the network often causes duplicate address assignments because of this
i finally gave up and assigned static addresses to all the machines
which means that when my yearold son brings that laptop to the network at his moms house hes going to get quite an education in tcpip configuration
unfortunately this product has very few competitors and the few i have found are much more expensive
so if you want a phoneline router this is probably still the one to get
however i could only recommend it to someone who is comfortable troubleshooting the issues described abovemy expectations for this lens were that the larger aperture would make it handy for quick naturallight captures of my grandchildren
in fact the struggles this lens has to focus usually make it very timeconsuming by which time my subject has become impatient  and wiggled away
operating as it does on my ti the telephoto effect of course reduces the overage adding to my challenges
finally f is not so much faster that kidwiggles do not turn into blurs
i have not yet done head to head resolution comparisons with my mm so i can comment on whether this potential strength will offset the weaknesses ive observedi guess that you get what you pay for  it is not exactly what i had expected as it relates to performance but i can work with it and will have no regrets about keeping itim not sure about this lens yet i have only used it once and it was loud
i dont really want to use it too much
but it does a good job as far as pictures
some day ill just have to spend the big money to get the good fixed  lenswhen it worked it worked well but after only a few months it had to be sent back to be replaced
the new one lasted for about  years untill the wireless side died
i was still able to use it hard wired up until i replaced it this past year with a newer modeli admit i bought this radio on price alone
i was interested in basically just the weather broadcasts
but it is difficult to find a portable unit that doesnt offer am and fm
the radio receives excellent reception
and the speaker sounds exceptionally well for such a small portable in my opinion
the only major drawback to this radio to me is its terrible battery compartment design
the unit takes four aa batteries one on top of the other rather than straight in a row
this requires that you squeeze back the little holding spring at the top to insert the battery beneath
its always been my opinion that all battery compartments on anything are designed by the sadist on staff at whatever company is producing it
but this one offers very little lee way even by the generous standards of terrible battery compartments
in my first try at inserting the batteries i managed to break one of the little retaining springs
rather than return the whole unit i fixed the problem by inserting a small piece of aluminum foil to allow the battery to make contact
since this radio will be almost exclusively used as a portable unit by most customers i felt compelled to mention that the battery department leaves a whole bunch to be desired
one other observation
this radio is just a smidgen over and inch wide at the bottom
although it has two little rubberized feet it is so narrow that unless it is placed on a dead level surface it tips over easily
this radio would be useless on a camping trip or picnic if you expect to place this on a rock or the ground
it will continuously tip over and drive you crazy
the three star rating on this radio is for the good reception of the weather forecasts and the excellent fm reception as well
its overall design is however very substandard and not very well thought outif you want a video camera for a low price this one has lots of nice features per dollar
certainly the only one worth buying in the sharp line u
the viewscreen and remote are good
the zoom is terrific and the catseye feature is pretty amazing in dusk lighting but the daylight picture quality is only comparable to mm in my estimation and  years experience with two previous canon mm camcorders
i expected better but even with k pixels it is grainy and only marginally better than my old canon mm cameras with k pixels
the still capture is again very grainy and painfully slow browsing thru the thumbnails now shopping for a still camera
i hope the camera is more durable than indicated by some other reviewersall in all  it is a good cheap replacement for my broken canon mm but it is not a step up in video quality that a more expensive canon zr might be
 stars for value but  stars for quotdigitalquot qualityi purchase this camcorder  and i am not satified with the picture quality
i got this because my anlalog camcorder was broken
it seems like there no difference in picture quality between the analog one and this one
if you dont mind the picture quality this one is for you because you cant find any digital cameras with this price
i am kinda regretting about getting this one
i would pay a little more to get one with better picture quality
it would be beneficial in a long termfirst the virtues  easy to connect good size wiring to these
 they are good functional all weather speakers
 the sound is not terriblenow the vices  the wall mount hardware goes on and off easily enough but the brackets block the very essential input terminals and sound switch on the back
totally frustrating when actually mounting and wiring the speakers
its as if idiots designed thisno one who actually had to mount these outside on a ladder usually
would ever want to contend with this awkward affair where one must twist and crane and quasimodo oneself in order to route and mount the wiring
music played through these speakers will impress only those unfortunate souls who have suffered hearing loss or who are used to listening to inexpensive boomboxes
wait some boomboxes actually have more low frequency punch than these speakers
but they are waterproof
i would have paid more for a wireless version of these
at the time i was searching i could not find any wireless outdoor speakers except the giant green mushroom style ones that are supposed to hide in a gardenand really i might have gone there but how can one camoflage a giant green mushroom that looks like plastic
thats ridiculous stealth and i for one would rather just admit to the world that the outdoor speakers arewellyou knowspeakersso as you can see the virtues and vices balance out in the end and so i think the rating of  out of  is fair
they are priced about where they should be and likely will last years so long as one does not believe that they are rock concert monitors and blast them to death with more than maybe  watts or so
i put automatically resetting circuit breakers in series with the signal so in the event of too much of a good thing they will protect the speakers
i would not exceed  amperes of current on the fuse or autobreakers
oh and for the dimwits who tagged these speakers let me be totally clear they are not wirelessi got this camera as a replacement for my giant but wonderful film camera when it first came out
it was great to just stick it in my purse and go
after a couple months the lcd screen stopped working
even when i took a picture it would come up black on my computer
i sent it back to canon and they fixed it
wish it wouldve worked right the first time aroundtheres a lag between when you hit the button and when it actually takes the picture results in some funnylooking posed pictures because people think the pictures already been taken
it doesnt take very good indoor photos flash looks harsh doesnt focus well
and action shots are kind of a problem unless theyre from a distance
the colors dont seem very truetolifei just got a photo printer and printed out a lot of photos taken with this camera and a few taken with a friends newish sony  megapixel camera
his photos were all much sharper and had much truer colorsince the pros of this camera has been beaten to death ill concentrate on the cons
i use this mostly for indoor shots with flashmore than half the photos have oversaturated color to the point where i have to desaturate many of them before showing them
also about one out of  photos is out of focusmy monitor is adjusted so that most digital photos i see from my other digital camera as well as on the web look normal
no gamma correction is appliedwhen previewing photos on the camera in the zoom mode it is very difficult to move the photo up and down because you have to hold down one key while pressing another key thats  mm apartredeye reduction works still a little bit of redeye remainsalthough not as good as i have hoped i still carry this camera with me everywhere until i find something better in this sizefirst of all its as big as a walnut
i feel badly because i gave it a bad review earlier today
then as a joke we put it on my gl
it was really bright
id said before that it wasnt but i was using it during an earlier part of the day
i only wish it came with some kind of diffusion because when it came on i saw white circles everywhere i looked for like  minutes
i am really glad to have this little thing if ever i get into a lowlight pinch because it probably will not eat up the battery too quickly
maybe i can make some kind of diffuser for it too
plugs right into the cameras shoe
i have deep set eyes so i felt more confident when the camera was on me knowing it was helping to balance that a little
if my subjects dont go blind im hoping that they too will feel good about having a little eyelight
also i dissed the price before but all photography equipment is ridiculously expensive
this is cheap by comparison
id change it to  stars despite the fact that a professional camera man laughed at this little thing the other day and told me not to use it
i might have to use it though so its part of my lightweight kitthe title at the top of this page says advanced access shoe
product description says advanced accessory shoe
confused
dont make a mistake when ordering as i did
for example this microphone dm will not fit the latest camcorders with the mini advanced shoe commonly called the mini advanced accessory shoe or just advanced accessory shoe
for that mini advanced shoe only the canon dm or smv microphones and canon vl or vfl video lights will fit without adapters or similarcanon is causing confusion with its unique shoes and vague names for the various shoes
this shoe has traditionally been called an accessory shoe
canon wants to drop the word accessory in some cases and add words like advanced or mini advanced
the problem is that stores and similar arent getting the difference
theyre still referring to it as an accessory shoe and tacking on canons unique words in some manner
as with this product page consumers are left to figure it all outthat said this is a nice looking microphone
feels quite solid in the hand as well
and i do prefer the foam windscreen over the hairy thing covering the dm that hair is sure to get all over everything
beyond that wouldnt fit my camcorder so cant say much more
knocking off two stars for the poor product description and the time ill waste with thattook me a while to figure this out but all of the built in camcorder mics and general purpose accessory mics like this one have a built in high pass filter which reduces recording of the lower frequency sounds to help remove the mechanical tape and zoom sounds from the recording
live music recordings will never sound right no matter which of the three setting you use because the low end is cut back on all of them
i finally bought the rode stereo vidmic which allows switching that filter off when you really want a balanced frequency response and found that my hv is really quite capable of recording excellent music audio
something that it could not do with the dmalthough this unit worked well i was not impressed with the directional aspect
it picked up noise from the side and didnt seem to as directional as i desired
i preferred using the camcorders built in mic to thisi bought this for my canon hg because the onboard mic picked up the videographers voice loud and clear but the subjects audio was very hard to hear
this mic didnt make much difference
when i am taping the kids and ask them a question my voice is very loud
their answers are barely audible
so much for being directional
it is nice that the power is on board as well
the noncanon mics have to be turned on and off usually and if you forget to turn them off dead battery oopsjust an fyi for anyone who isnt paying attention and orders this mic for hf or any canon camcorder with the mini advanced access shoe its not the correct mic
youll want to order the canon dm canon b dm directional stereo microphone for hf and hf camcordersive contacted amazon and asked them to unlink this product from the camcorders that require the mini advanced access showim using this with an optura  the sound quality is fine
it doesnt totally eliminate the motor noise but its a definite improvement
sure there are cheaper mics that do a better job in reducing motor noise which i have tried but the first time i forgot to turn on the mic i missed some of the first belly laughs of my newborn and immediately decided to give this mic a shot
bottom line the combo of better sound quality than the internal mic and camera integration was worth iti purchased the nikon mm fd to use in conjunction with my nikon ds
i am going through my prime phase which was precipitated by a bad encounter with anikon mm fd edif afs zoom nikkor lens for nikon digital slr camerasthat i could just not get to perform under any circumstances
i go through this phase about every  years selling off my nikon zooms and replacing them with nikon prime lensesfirst the good
build quality of this lens is fantastic
the size and weight of the lens made it a pleasure to carry
dx shooters must remember the effective focal length of this lens on a dx camera is mm when considering the crop factor
the f  aperture is great for low light shooting particularly indoors where you are always begging for more light
even in these situations however top performance is gained when using the nikon creative lighting system with the lens
distortion is easily corrected in light room  and  through auto correction
contrast and color tones were great
the lens focuses very fast and vignetting is not an issue on a dx camera other reviewers reported vignetting on fx sensorsnow the not so good
lens flare is a problem especially considering it does not come with a hood
i highly recommend picking up azeikos zelh mm soft rubber lens hood blackto mitigate flare
this type of flaring is not unusual in lenses of this focal length however
the focal length of course is a very limiting factor at times
i would consider this lens a general walk around and not suitable for landscape on a dx camera
it is simply not wide enough
for landscape i would strongly consider thenikon mm fg ed if autofocus dx nikkor zoom lensor thetokina mm f atx pro dx zoom digital lens for nikon af mount or the nikon  if you can find it as reasonably priced alternatives
i am compelled to agree with another reviewer that this lens does not compare well with the newer primes such as thenikon mm fg afs dx lens for nikon digital slr camerasor for example the venerablenikon mm fg sic sw prime nikkor lens for nikon digital slr cameras which just blows me away every use with the mm perhaps being the best deal and a must have lens for every dx shooter
i am still testing this lens but those are my observations so far under normal shooting conditions
this is not to say the lens itself is bad
however i can clearly see the lens is not as sharp across the full aperture range as you would expect
and like the other reviewer i need to get close to the subject to obtain sharpness which for my shooting needs amounts to about  of my shots
i will say that amazons shoddy packaging may be to blame for the poor performance of this lens
the lens was packed in a box way too big and with no bubble wrap and it was evident the box had been tossed arounddespite its shortcomings i still recommend this lens for most shooters
in my case th eperformance surpasses my  and i simply found that i did not want to walk around town with a  hanging off my neck
it gets old pretty quick and takes a lot of room in my bag
because of amazons poor packaging i may give it a few more days of testing and then return this lens for another one and see how that test goes
if anything changes i will update my reviewone the main reasons i rushed to own an fx nikon is to use wide angle lenses like this one
the mm fs speed is of no concern to me as i am usually in good light outdoors or use a tripod
id expect this lens to be sharp and it is in the center gradually becoming quite unsharp in the corners
i assumed this was field curvature and shot some subjects where the edges are about the same distance as the center and they are still rather soft
perhaps somewhere inbetween it will be
anyway the sharpness is good and the distortion is minimal
what is not good is the close focusing distance which is really not close enough for me after having been spoiled by the presumably less worthy sigma mm f macro
that one costs about a hundred and fifty more and now i wish i had opted for it with the nikon mount
the autofocus on this lens is nothing quick as far as i can tell either
i say meh to the mm f nikkor af
it isnt bad and i really wanted to like it even half as much as say the mm dc nikkor which is great but i do not
it is light and small and the price was low
isolating small subjects in a mm is a joy if you can get quite close
it creates a sense of space and perspective that widens the minds eye
you cannot do that with this lens
ill try a  on it tomorrow and see how that goesif you need a compact wide angle lens try this one
on a nikon dx body it resembles the mm focal length which is useful outdoors for a variety of shooting
indoors with flash it also works for events or weddings
acting like a mm with dx it is not that hard to master this lens as a wide angle lens is harder to work with for people photography
the nikon hn lens shade is one that i recommend with this lens for dx
it is slightly longer than the official hn 
for fx you will need the hn shade to not only help tame the flare but to keep your fingers off the glass
the front element is quite close to the front
this lens is not the new afs series that nikon is now promoting
it will not match up in appearance to those lenses
however the nikon standard mm filter size on this lens is quite handy especially if you have a mm filter collection
also the lens seems quite sturdy and well made
i would have given this lens   stars if amazon allowed it
this lens is not real sharp on the edges it has a tendancy to flare it is f and not f the hn hood is not very effective
it is easy to rub your clothes on the front element
it is very compact
the af is ok but you should always make your own testsbackfocuses too much
i was really trying to like this lens as it had pretty good reviews here and alli have a mm prime from the same family but this is a much better focus rangemaybe there is some way to calibrate this lens to my camera but i do not know howi am using it on a di cant see how to insert a photo into this review so i cannot show you but i have some photos i would like to show youi started with the mm  and f
then got this mm f
almost all of my night photos were blurry
 is just not bright enough
i was spoiled by my  and  also it seems kind of bad wide open so you have to mostly use it in reasonable light and stopped down
not for night photossomeone suggested mm for street photography but i think they meant on full framed cameras
its okay for street photos but im thinking mm on dx might be better especially with hyper focal distance and getting closer
because on dx mm is more like mmand i would not recommend mm for portraits
theres a lot of face distortion
fitting the whole person in the frame might be ok especially with street work but its not really for closeups of faces unless youre aiming for the distorted lookthis is an undistinguished but competent lens a viable solution for dx users looking for a normal lens at a bargain price and a useful and inexpensive wide angle for fx and film shootersit can not be said that nikon spared no expense in the development of this lens
they spared plenty settling on a minimalist simple proven optical formula without the closerange correction crc used in some of its moreexpensive contemporaries and with an unambitious f maximum aperture
that last detail in todays world of smallframe dx dslrs becomes the lens single major drawback
todays zoom lenses are good enough to equal the performance of a prime in most regards making fast apertures the last remnant of fixedfocallength superiority in the minds of most photographers and a prime lens as slow as an f professional zoom is left with comparatively little to recommend it
yet that has ironically led to this lens one significant advantage it has remained cheap while prices for other lenses have risen significantly and for those whose needs it meets it can be seen as quite a bargainits performance is perfectly respectable
in fact wideopen at normal shooting distances it is already quite sharp something that can not be said for many fast primes and it manages to provide crisp modern contrasty color renditions no doubt thanks to state of the art  as of its introduction  lens coatings
it has the nice rather frictionless focus feel that was common to most early af primes with the easytoreach frontmounted focusing ring that was a welcome holdover from manualfocus days
many newer lenses with focus rings hidden from easy reach behind the zoom ring for example are much more difficult to use when manual focus is called for although most do have the advantage of allowing instant manual override
like any afd lens the user of this lens must flip a switch on the camera body to disengage the focus motor and switch from auto to manual focusthere is one other nice feature of this lens that holds up very well in todays dslr world and that it its mm focal length
while anything in the mmmm range can be considered a normal lens for dx nikons own mm dx prime is a bit on the long side for many and at mm this lens represents an excellent alternative
ive owned and used and posted a review of the g and i love it but in my opinion this is one of its drawbacks
i personally prefer the slightly wider field of view of the mm perspective which in my experience is a bit handier for indoor photography in tighter spaces and a bit more naturalfeeling as a normal lens for dx
sigmas mm f is another alternative and faster but i found my copy to be mediocre at wide apertures and would generally hold it to f or so anyway taking away much of its advantage of speed  and it is a much more expensive lensthe mm begins to look like a very good choice when its workmanlike performance its normal field of view and its small size are considered against its very low current price
for dx users this lens is not exactly a bargain when purchased new  it is more expensive than the mmg for example  but used prices are a different story and for photographers willing to buy used it can be a bargain
for a dx shooter on a budget who is looking for a normal lens and who does not already have a professionallevel midrange zoom that offers an f aperture the mm can be a uniquely affordable and versatile tool for general photography
combined with inexpensive standard and telephoto zooms this lens can complete a modest collection of starter lenses that will leave very few types of photography off limits
in fact somebody looking to start out in slr photography on a budget could do a lot worse than to pick up a decent copy of this lens a used nikon ddd and begin making pictures limited in quality only by their own talentsmy rating of three stars for this lens should not be considered negative
i dont think a higher rating is justified and i dont believe in rating lenses on a sliding scale depending on their price  a four star lens is a four star lens whether it sells for  or ten times that
it is up to the reader to make their own judgement as to whether the price makes the lens a more or less compelling purchase
this lens does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well
the basis for my rating is as follows the lens performs competently but not spectacularly as a mm prime
by itself that would probably justify four stars but its only fair to also take into account its very modest design capabilities
its slow speed in particular compared with other lenses of its type reduces its appeal and the lack of a sophisticated highly corrected optical formula is a factor as well
this lens while possibly a bargain and a fine choice for many photographers is practically the definition of average in terms of performance and thats how i rate itmiscellaneous notes vs nikons mm fg the  is a bit sharper but the  is sharp as well
with mostly minor distinctions these lenses do pretty much the same things on dx and the mm can be picked up on the used market for much less than the mm sells for
the real distinctions between these lenses are the price the speed and the focal length
while most will understandably settle on the mm for many photographers the mm could be the better choice vs sigmas mm f my copy of the sigma was mediocre at wide apertures removing most of its advantage over the mm nikkor
it is much heavier much more expensive to buy either new or used and has very close to the same field of view
if speed is paramount it is the obvious choice  otherwise the nikons price and overall performance make it the better buy with the nikon g probably better still for fx its tougher to make an argument for this lens on fx
fx shooters are less likely to be bargain hunters and there are better choices almost regardless of ones criteria for selecting a lens
i can envision a narrow niche for an fx shooter who wants an unobtrusive lightweight lens and a moderate wideangle view and in such a case this lens low purchase price makes it a perfectly satisfactory option
sigmas mm and nikons g are dx lenses and are therefore removed from consideration for fx shooters
the obvious alternatives on fx would be nikons mm fd or mm fd  but in reality for most fx users the real alternative will be an f midrange zoom buying new vs buying used good lenses tend to hold their value very well and they last a long time
consequently the market for used lenses is vibrant and relatively efficient
in the case of this lens the disparity between the new purchase price and the current used market value is high and i would advise any prospective purchaser of this lens to find a good used copy from a reputable source such as many of the used vendors right here on amazon
be sure to pricecheck against other vendors to ensure youre getting a fair price of course
buying used avoids the large onetime depreciation from buying new and will probably allow the user to resell the lens at some time in the future with little or no loss of value
this is a good strategy for any costconscious photographerthe lens worked fine out of the box
but we sent it back because you have to be so close to get a picture of your subject
right up in their face
the camera needs to be only  to fill the framei have a nikon d and this lens wasnt auto focus i had to return it
the seller was very honest and kind
i was sad the lens didnt work on a full frameit was a bit slow on the focus
but i guess you get what you pay for
a bit soft when it came to shooting quicklyi bought this with unrealistic expectations hoping it would be almost as good as the more expensive mm f
its really not
ive found this to be an excellent lens in bright light only
in low light i photograph a lot of musicians performing in theaters or clubs its only especially good at mm and f
the more you zoom the less sharp the pictures are
not a bad lens but not a great one eitherthe results are from using this lens with my d fx mp body
this lens has way too much chromatic aberration at f which very noticeable and takes away from the usefulness of the lens wide open
the lens shows a very good bokeh outoffocus blur
the sharpness is good
the lens is built well and adequate for general photography just not outstanding more suitable for low light photography when you need something faster than f in the short telephoto range
the focus is fast never had any issues
on a dx body it will have a field of view of a mm f lens
the newer g version is not any better and cost more
if you can afford the f version you will be much happierthis is a tentative review and ive factored in the high price for the rating  buti tested this lens for sharpness and it isnt much different from other cheaper lenses i tried
 i somehow had the illusion that the lens would yield a sharper image when shooting the books in  my library and looking at the printed titles
my  vrii kicks the  out of the park with sharpness because the main source of blur is hand shake which the vr cures
but i dont deny the perceptions of other shooters in this review forumnow i am classified as colorblind because i dont pass the tests where you have to see the numbers buried in the colored balls
yet i see color
am i kidding myself
anyhow i notice the lens  d brings out colors that my naked eye doesnt pick upevidently the quality of this lens isnt measured by simple sharpness tests of shooting and blowing up images
what i found is that hand shake trumps all sources of blur and if you control that you get great results with many lenseswhat the other reviews are talking about is an evanescent quality in the image that magically emerges in shooting
it is bokeh and color vividness mainlyso i am going to review this and up the rating as i actually shoot with this lens if i see what others are talking about
until then i am bringing my vr lenses alongadded   i have just realized the apparent softness could be a limit of the lcd screen on the d
it seems that printing the picture is the main testbut heres another comment about the reviews of my review
i notice a  favorable which is hardly statistically significant but it points out a serious failing in the thought process of people
here it is in a nutshell cultivate and consider contrarion opinions to your own especially if you think they are wrong
this is  because partisanship im right youre wrong
makes you stupid
i have to force myself to do this as its a strong tendency of the human mind to do this science tries with varying success to overcome this but i offer this as a view on how you can judge a lens
for example the limit in resolution of the lcd could be a cause but no one offered that idea
overall i am disturbed by the inability of the d to catch subtle shadings of light the canon d i tested  was much better
is my perception a result of the d lcd
if so why does the canon d seem a better lightcatcher
comments welcomevery soft in corners when wide open
the only advantage is its weight  it is a very light lensive had this lens for several months
its fast and the image quality is decent but for the price its quite good
focuses well even in lowlight conditionsrare focusing misses from time to time
the colors do tend to shoot a little on the warm side
chromatic aberration is often present in high contrast areas
so why only  stars
it shoots soft images
if youre a casual shooter you may not care or notice but if youre someone whos a stickler for this type of thing you may want to spend a little more and buy the so its difficult to know how to write a review for a budget lens
do i rate it based off of price or product quality or both
i opted for a little of both leaning more towards quality
obviously one cannot expect prolevel optics for the price of this lens
is this lens worth the price sure but if your budget allows for the   id opt for that over the didnt even last me a year
the auto focus broke
have to use it in manual
i dont have time for manual being a wedding photographer
it was a great lens while it lastedalot of different opinions in the review forums here on amazon
i ended up sending this one back and buying the  as it just seemed more substantial in my hand
i know that is a soft reason to pay twice the price but i love my   for a more budget conscious person this is still a good lens thoughdo not buy this lens as your primary lens if you own a nikon dslr d d d
the focal length mm makes it a telephoto lens mm on a digital camera
imagine trying to take photographs of your family indoors using a telephoto lens
you will only be able to capture the head and part of the torso of one person
instead buy the mm f or the mm f focal length lenses stay away from the sigma mmwith that said this lens is awesome for low light indoors and outdoor night work
i bought this lens for available light photography meaning indoors or from street lamps outdoors at night
i am very pleased with the results
it is quite a bit sharper than the     or    nikon zooms that i own
to me sharpness is worth doing without a zoom
this would be on my camera x if the focal length was mm not mm
so if you need a lens for availablelight use in portrait or some telephoto work not as a prime on a digital camera this lens is perfectionplease note that my three star rating is based solely on the quality of the lens not on my review of the application above
the resulting sharpness of the photos is very good but not nearly on a par with my yashicabrand zeiss lenses which had a similar price point in  adjusted for inflation and the build is plastic made in china
therefore the quality of what you get compared with the price you paid is about a three or a four very good not a five the bestnikon mm fd af wideangle nikkor lens for nikon mm and digital slr camerassigma mm f ex dc hsm lens for nikon digital slr camerasgood lens but i am so used to zooming from  for much of my street photography that i am not getting much use out of this lensi bought this lens to take photos of my  month old son with the d
which means indoor shots
i had to stand too far back
i ordered the nikon mm f instead
it was alot better
if you are planning to use this indoor i would suggest you look at the mm unless you have a big housei was surprised to find after reading so many positive reviews of this lens that the copy i received was so fuzzy at wideopen apertures that i could see it on unmagnified images right on my ds  screenall lenses lose sharpness at wide apertures this is a matter of basic physics and is the result of something called spherical aberration
some are much better than others though thanks to better optical designs that more effectively correct for this tendency
the mm f for example is very good wide open the mm f is decent and very appropriate for portrait use
my copy of the mm f lost both sharpness and significant contrast as f was approached
i would quantify it as followsf very fuzzy well beyond soft reduced contrast almost unuseablef still quite soft much improved contrastf slightly soft good contrastf sharp good contrastf very sharp good contrastthese results were repeatable on my sample and held true regardless of shutter speed and techniquenotes the advantage of a lens like this is the ability to use wide apertures
a good portrait lens need not be particularly sharp but wider than f my copy of this lens was soft enough that i would use it for nothing other than casual peoplephotography
it would not suffice for critical night or lowlight photography or for general photography where sharpness might be desired
for photos of people it was fine at f but below that it lost so much sharpness and enough contrast that photos of almost any subject looked dull the lens seems like an obvious choice as a first prime due to its price and the many excellent reviews of it here on amazon and elsewhere
even besides the sharpness degradation wide open i found it less useful than id hoped
on a cropsize dslr it is a short telephoto lens and it just hasnt turned out to be a focal length i use all that much
i would urge potential buyers to consider the mm f before this lens as it gives the traditional normal perspective on a nikon cropsize dslr some reviewers like this lens for portrait use but again i found it poorly suited for this
the mm f is admittedly more expensive but it has far more potential as a portrait lens this is not a highcontrast lens
it does not use any ed glass elements which seem to be quite magical at improving contrast and color rendition is noticeably less vibrant than such lenses
for some types of photography this can actually be desirable but for general or landscape photography i prefer the highercontrast lenses my sample of this lens may have been below average considering that most reviews of the lens are very positive
however if you read carefully most thorough reviews do mention that it loses contrast and acuity at wide apertures
ken rockwell for example has reviewed the lens very positively but when it came time to suggest lenses sharp enough to be used on the new dx with its ultrahighresolution sensor he gave the similarperforming possibly better f g version only three stars
i would submit that it is really not quite as sharp a lens as its reputation would lead one to believe
my excellent mm dx zoom for example the only lens ive given a fivestar review as of this time is far sharper than this lens up to around f and hold an edge even there and beyond nikon has recently announced a new mm f dx lens
ive ordered one and will probably post a review once ive had a chance to use it
i would suggest that it is very likely to be a better choice than this lens for almost any dx user
being designed for the smaller dx sensor it will probably be optimized for high linear resolutions within the smaller dx image circle
it is also a fairly inexpensive lens not much more than this lens now that the mm has crept up a bit in price even if my sample is significantly poorer than average my experience indicates that it would be a good idea to thoroughly test a copy of this lens before committing to buy it
be sure to compare images at wide apertures to those made at f where sharpness should be very good and determine for yourself whether the loss of sharpness and contrast is acceptable for your purposes focus is plenty quick and accurate at least on my sample
no problems at all in this regard and none expectedthis nikon lens works decently but when i got home i noticed a little violet dot in the middle of my photos
apparently this is common please read  i have a nikon d and cant seem to get the af feature to work then i realized that the af works if you have a motor camera body
i dont mind focusing on my own though great piece of glassmy primary purpose for this lens was low light exposures where i wanted to use it wide open at f
unfortunately at f the images are soft
at f and smaller however the images are crisp and very contrasty
closer to f softness creeps in again
at first i thought i too may have had a bad sample
but a second copy that i tried gave the same results
if you intend to use this lens between f and f it will produce excellent images
however if you  are looking to use it for high speed photography shallow dof or low light photography ie
wide open aperture this lens may not be for you
i suppose that is to be expected for a lens that only costs  update  ive been using the mm fd since i returned this lens and performance at f is superior
i definitely do not recommend the f lens if your intention is to use it for low light shooting at fi researched this lens thought it would be compatible on my d even asked and expert and they said yes if its this lens your talking about it will work well must not be the lens because no autofocus and no vr
didnt expect the vr but when your shooting sports autofocus on a tripod is super convient and a musti was mislead said manual focus will be easy with this lens i was wrong is much harder to focus in this lens using manual i find easier to focus using manual with my zoom lens mm vr even in focus i still often get bury picture  i dont recommended for d or dx user u should try it before you buy it
u lens kit is good enough no need this lense since only gave you mm d is nice but little useless when is so hard to focus
hopefully nikon will be coming out a motor build in prime lens for d and dx in the future
some shot does look sharp but is not worth the time to get it right a vr telephoto will do better in low light i compare to both
i was expect more from prime lens i think downfault is probably frustrated manual focusthis is a nice lens and if you dont read the d manual or are familiar with the whole afafs thing it wont autofocus on the d
i know this is obvious to all the manual readers out there but i thought it important to let the rest of us know that this wonderful lens has no focus motor in it and thus will not work on the dmy original post is below for additional scorni just got this nice lens and couldnt wait to try it out
plopped it on my d and it wouldnt focus
looked all around for the automanual switch and couldnt find it so looked in the instructions where it said something like manual focus only on the dwhat
how could this be
what ticks me off is that i read everything on amazon on this lens trying to decide if i really needed onemorelens and nowhere did i see that there were any compatibility issues
as this was fulfilled by adorama i have to pay return postageneedless to say im not happy at allbtw i also have a  uv filter i bought thats probably not worth the return shipping cost eitheri didnt buy this for the low price i bought it for its quality at a now deeply discounted price
its often reviewed as producing better results than the gversion and thats what mattered to mebut omg
right out of the box it was falling apart
after a cursory look for dust and grease and for  anything else obviously wrong i put on a hoya protective filter and it felt loose
i took the filter off and tried again
i dont torque filters to a lens i handle them both gently and thought i hadnt engaged the threads properly or that i hadnt tightened the filter all the way
i tried three times being increasingly careful each time and it still felt loose
only as i was removing it for the fourth time did i see that the barrel of the lens at the objective side was what was loose and jigglingarounda mm prime lens that cant hold the lens elements in alignment is slightly more useful than a cardboard toiletpaper tube and the test images proved thatrats
im sure these are made in huge quantities and one or two bad ones are bound to get through  you cant test each and every lens  but i still feel that it shouldnt have been possible for a defect of this nature to get throughlook at it carefully when you open the box and when you buy online only use vendors like amazon who make it easy to return a defective itemnote  i also purchased a  nikkor with a vibration reduction system that didnt work diagnosed by nikon usa who were very helpful
nikon wanted me to send the lens to tem for repair andor replacement but since it was new and i would have had to pay to send it to nikon i sent it back to amazon too
waiting on the replacement
perhaps the gods of photography are telling me they dont want me to get involved again in slr photographygreat sharp lens but shoots more at a mm
not accommodating for tight spaces as you would think
want to do the mm think it will be a bit more useful for menikon mm fd af nikkor lens for nikon digital slr camerasbought this lens last week and have been shooting in various lights indoor and outdoor using a nikon d camerahere are my observationspros decently fast lens
 aperture is nice
cheap
allows you to venture into the prime lens world of photography if you are new to photography andor want to try something outside of standard zooms
the angle of view is pretty close to angle of human eyes normal vision especially on full frame camera like dcons
overhyped lens
struggles to focus at short distances
hunts for focus sometimes
 is not ideal for portraits as the resulting image is not at all sharp
stop down to  or  you get usable picture
that kinds of defeats the whole point around being  what is good in having a d but cannot truly use that
i can see that in a zoom lenses where lenses typically falls short at the widest aperture andor extremes of zooms
but for a prime lens i expected it to produce much sharper images as the optics of the lens should not be super complex
build quality is ok plastic
dont expect to survive if it falls on a hard floor
i see only limited use
may be landscapes and some group pictures
i can do the same with a decent  which tend to  usually produce sharp pictures midzoom
lots of moving around to get right composition especially inside the house where typically there are fewer choices of positionsangles
you have to be very close to get a decent portraiti am going to return this and probably start saving to get a sigma mm sigma mm f ex dg hsm lens for nikon digital slr cameras which is about four times the price of this one if i want to get a prime lens at some pointgood luck i accidentally bought this
its my fault
i should have double checked it
i meant to buy the  gi called amazon who personally called my seller with me still on the line holding to cancel the order
i was assured by amazon the order was canceled bc she spoke with them
the next day my seller sends me emails saying they received a notification that i canceled the order
then later i received a order was shipped notification i was horrified then my seller wrote to me sorry we already shipped your order if you want to return for full refund just refuse the shipment i waited for the day itd come
i heard a knock on the door i went immediately to the door but what do you know
it was just left it there and they drove off immediately
i had no chance to refuse itnow if i really still wanted to have a refund id have to go through a whole bunch of issues with having to pay for the return shipping and them only giving me a partial refund
so much trouble
so i just decided to keep this its not horrible
it works well for bokeh effects with its aperture of  but its a manual focus which is trouble some if youre on the go and dont have time to manually focus for every shot in terms of qualify i prefer the  g this one lacks contrast and has more noise
the bokeh are more octagon and is not rounddont even consider this just seriously go with the new lensoh yes if youre wondering the seller i bought from was beach camera
want a better experience buy from someone differentdont know if its just my lens or this is characteristic of this lens in general but when shooting into the light or photographing a subject against a blownout background my lens produces a sizeable purple flare circle right in the middle of the frame
sometimes it is very distinct and can clearly be seen in camera when composing a shot sometimes it is less pronounced and is only noticeable on a computer screen
i find it a very annoying drawback
i also have a nikon mm fd af nikkor lens and ive never experienced anything like that with that lens
has anyone noticed a similar problem
im curiousi didnt think i would mind the only manual focus but it is a big pain with this lens
after you spend  minutes focusing and shooting and focusing again itll take nice picturesbuild quality feels a little cheap but that aspect never affected me just have never found a great use for this one
the kit mmmm kit lens that comes with a lot of nikons tends to be more versatile for the shortish range this tends to be used for
i might recommend it for shooting objects forget it for landscapes or interiors too narrow to have much of an effectgreat optics for the price
housing is of cheap plastic
i was amazed how sharp and clear the pictures werefor the pricethis flash works great with my nikon film slr but it doesnt work with my new nikon d
get something that is going to be more compatiblei am a beginner and only have a few nikon lenses
however i was surprised when i opened the package to find this lens as the only nikon lens ive seen to have  no lens hood  no lens cap on the filmsensor sidemm d is nice
the thing is at f i cannot get a sharp image maybe because this lens is not designed for digital camerawhen at f this lens is perfect
so just buy a d and use falso i think in us d is much more expensive than it should be
 for a new one is reasonableg should be better than this
i want a g but it is too expensive for meif you want to save money d
if you want a powerful lens g
if you want a tradeoff between them g
of course if d is below  it is a perfect choicewhen i purchased this lens i was looking for a low light lens with the solid construction and exceptional performance i enjoyed with the mm f lens i used  years ago with my nikon f series
what i got instead was a mediocre made in china lens that hunts and is noisy when focusing
very disappointedi already have a the mm af vrii lens from nikon which is an exceptional lensi was looking to use the mm in lower light situations but the lens is not worth the  so ill be returning this one to amazoni am a demanding amateur and the sample i got of this lens left me fairly unsatisfied
i realize that this was the fastest everyman  mm prime that nikon made for years so i would naturally expect great things from itunfortunately this thing is so soft at f that it is basically unusable wide open
there is also serious cacolor fringing all the way up to f
it is very usable at  and peaks at about ffor fx users i can definitely see a use for it since the full frame  mm fov is useful indoors and there isnt much wiggle room if you need that extra half stop but for dx users myself included with the x crop factor you can go ahead and just buy the mm  if you need indoor natural light stuff
the reason i say this is that f you are only going to need inside and for dx format the  mm field of view is way too tight for most indoor situationsalso if you are a dx user and have a inbody focus drive the  mm d is much cheaper and has near equivalent performance at apertures you would actually use outside or with strobe situations
evaluate your focal length needs carefully and if you dont need  mm then dont waste your money
in real world situations  mm on a dx is a somewhat odd field of view
the  mm fd or  mm g are both fantastic lenses and can be used in pretty much any situation that the  mm can and more you just have to move your feet a bitanother characteristic of note here is that there is a g version of this lens
it is more modern and much larger than the d unfortunately and has more distortion but excels in everything elsebokeh is pretty good
however due to its straight iris blades keep in mind that specular highlights will appear as polygons at smaller apertures f  summaryprosgreat in low lightvery smallcompact for a f lensconsodd fov on dx this did not effect my star ratingvery soft wide openmassive color fringing and ca till about fflares very easilyconclusionthere are very few situations for dx users where you would need this lens and if you do need a   mm i would save your money and get the g
its less prone to flaring and has more modern optics like aspheres which control ca better
if you need a  mm and are okay giving up  a stop get the  mm g
the d is cheaper but has a wicked flare problem for indoor use its good though
first i would try the  mm g for all other uses
its more versatile on dx formatall in all this is a decent lens for what it is a fd mm d lets look at the numbers shall we  the same wide aperture as a myriad of other lenses at the same focal length that do the job way sharper and quicker  not too bad of a fstop for mm
the dx younger brother version of this lens nearly a full stop slower than thatmm min focal length
this is a very good wide angle fov if youre shooting full frame or film but if youre shooting dx  crop factor than it equates to roughly mm not exactly off to a good start for a lens they want you to just leave on all the timemm  again a good length especially considering its only stopped down to  by the time you get out thered  this means you can use it on several digital bodies and nearly all of the film bodies since  thats greatmy main issues with this lens are that its not nearly as sharp as id like it to be
it seems to me that nearly every picture i take in lighting conditions any less than direct sunlight are backfocused by several millimeters
thats a lotand when switching to macro you have this cantankerous little switch operation you have to do to switch the lens into macro mode thereby opening up the ability to focus at all distances but limiting the focal length to mm why
why cant you just trust me as a photographer to focus correctly
why does there need to be a switch between me and my shotthe glass is clear and big which is nice but when it doesnt grab focus the way it should thats all kind of meaninglessoverall build quality is good
ive had this lens for years and have never had any issues with it loosening up of wearing out
its built to last but alas still not that greatin conclusionmehthe lens itself is an ok lens
i knew that when i bought it
i bought it new and one of amazons partners supplied the lens and shipped it to me
however upon opening the package it was obvious that i was sent a used lens
it was not wrapped in plastic half the packaging material was missing as was the warranty card
amazon offered me the choice of a substantial discount on the lens or i could return it
i kept the lens and it has worked welli probably wont purchase another lens from amazon that doesnt come from amazon directlysince i used to own this lens i will give my report
the mm filter threads are a royal pain
mm has been the usual standard for nikon for many years although that has been changing
if you have a lot of them at that sizeyou may want to skip this offering and get the mm f afd
the lenses are similar enough in quality
the mm f afd uses a mm lens shade the hn which is also compact but not deep enough to be very effective
on a nikon crop body you can use an hn which is actually for the mm f afd
it is deeper yet it is compact
the nikon hb for the mm lens is quite wide and hard to deal with when using a lens pouch on your belt
the hb is a also a very shallow lens hood and therefore not very effective
this makes the mm f not very compact
again the mm f or the mm f would be my choices for compactness with a mm lens shade attached
i am not going to mention the compact nikon mm f afd
i have not used one because i dont consider mm wide
it is more like a normal lens to my way of thinkingthe mm f afd catches stray light from everywhere so a lens shade is mandatory
i always use a lens shade for protection
i never use a protective filter because it adds flare and can reduce sharpness
the mm afd has a lot of cas
most of the new cameras can correct this when shooting in jpg mode
the distortion on the mm f afd is severe
straight lines do not remain straight neither does the mm f afd keep straight lines straight
i would choose the mm f afd if i wanted a better quality lens
the mm f afd is not an easy wide lens to work with
the mm f  afd is a bit easier to work with for the inexperienced
for people pics the mm f afd is nicer to work with than either the mm f afd or the mm f afd
crc is helpful on the mm f afd and the mm f afd
so all in all if you need very wide then this mm f afd is probably your choice
i hope you enjoyed my commentsthe  f is obviously a good piece of glass
stout sturdy professional grade but it failed to meet my expectations when compared to the more modern technology of the  or the current 
the lens received was wobbly when attached to the camera
and the lens lockout switch would not secure
overall sharpness across the zoom range was spotty best performance as expected was around f to  i purchased the lens for its maximum aperture of  and this is where it performed the least
nice lens but less than i needed
bgsi returned this lens because it showed severe back focus on my de
it is supposed to be a legendary lens but i was not all that impressed even with manual focus
of course you should pay no attention to this  a serious review would require many pages and detailed testing which i have not donethis lens is great and iffy at the same timei used it on a d and experienced backfocus issues and then discovered in the lenscamera compatibility charts that the af used in this lens is not totally compatible with the newer af technology used in the d
ok it was released in  but why hasnt the tech been changed to adopt new camerasits still sold new and i blame nikon for not making it more obvious that it will have consistency issues at widely used focal lengths
were talking out of focus eyes and an inch of fudge room on a lower tier body like the dthat being said it works flawlessly on my d optically speaking as well as hitting focus well but i paid  for that camera not 
it somehow can figure it out but the d cantand nikon almost omits that fact except for one line of text in the user manual of the lens
you wont see it in adverts on bh adorama or amazon buyer beware
id check if you have any camera that isnt full frame but has a focus motor d d d d
the d d d and d should all focus just fine and if the d has a af finetune they can all fix lens calibration issues to a point
im banking on the estimate that fullframe bodies will focus more accurately
however the d may share focusing with the d which i havent tested on this lensanother issuethe afmf selector ring is a faulty design and will break
google it because its a very common issue apparently
the fix is thankfully reportedly easy rather than shipping it to nikon so if you like to diy dont worry too muchbasically a small ratchet activated inside the barrel when you turn the afmf selector ring but it is plastic and easily wears and breaks
by pulling back the larger rubber grip and untaping the cover you can move the ratchet catch over and reglue with stronger adhesive
looks like nikon wanted an easy repair according to some reviews of the fix ive read the part looks like it was engineered to be moved over to easily fix the issue without a new part
also the ring itself on my lens has fractured and is another common problem with this lens if it gets bad that afmf black ring develops a huge crack and can break pieces offpersonally i find any lens thats over  dollars to be shamefully constructed if it fails like this under normal operating conditions
the whole body is mostly metal except this part that breaks
failure on nikons part and something else im surprised they dont fix before continuing production
of course they may have stopped production a year ago who knowsthere have been something around  models to supersede this one and yet nikon still neglects to update the design
its a great inexpensive  zoom but be prepared for some minor repairs on it and watch out for compatibility on less than pro level bodiesso far my likenew copy when purchased used has not failed its main use but has no manual focus because of the ratchet failing and has a hairline crack in the afmf ring just as many reportsave your money if you can get the vrii version or consider the vri copy which may have its own shortcomings im not sure
or if you can pick this up for  like i did go for it and dont look back
you dont need vr in many cases anyway and you can buy something else with your  you saved and earn money with photography to upgrade later
thats what im doingif you save or sell your current crop body you can get a nice d with the added cash you save buying one of these usedi do recommend the lens to those that know what they are doing but warn individuals who arent up for troubleshooting
i knocked one star for nikon failing to address the compatibility issue more and another because the crappy afmf switch that is truly a sad thing on a nice lens like thisi tried this lens at three different stores and all lens brand new had some imperfections on the glass elements and they were soft
right after taking a few shots with this lens i put mm  and the images with same lighting condition and exposure values are much more popping out with higher contrast and much sharper
it doesnt have vr but i turned off vr on  when doing the test to bring both lenses to the same shooting condition
i guess nano coating makes all that differencei was really excited to find this lens
i shoot in two different states quite a bit and fly commercially between the two so i was looking for a backup to mynikon mm fg ed vr ii afs nikkor zoom lens for nikon digital slr camerasto leave in one location all the time so i didnt have to carry so much gear
i absolutely love my  it has amazing focus beautiful bokeh when shooting wide open and is one of my two favorite lenses
i shouldnt have tried to cut corners with this lens
it was designed for film cameras so it is full frame but it just doesnt focus well
i was using it to shoot indoors in relatively low light and as much as  of the photos werent crisp even when wide open
plus it doesnt focus as quickly as the  it looks cool it comes in a sort of vintage case that i like
but i need function more than appearance when it comes to my camera gearthe lens collar the part of the lens you attach a monopod or tripod to also isnt as long as the  so its shorter than the camera bodyi tried two different copies of this lens actually  because the st replacement amazon shipped out was a used lens and found it front focuses on my d at both  and   i tried to adjust focus in camera but even the maximum adjustment would not correct this
i experimented with focusing on a angled ruler and found that the focus was quite accurate however in portrait applications even with a tripod and completely still subject all of these lenses had a strong tendency to front focus leaving the eyes in the  the rear of the dof and not as sharp as the shirt collar or whatever else happened to be directly forward of the focal point
i was using a single focal point and i have not had the same issue on any of my other lenses
when it functioned properly i loved this lens
however k is to much to accept great when it works properly
the dc function works well bokeh is as adveritsed but it does seem to increase the front focus issue at     why buy a  lens if it cant be effectively usedits a fine lens
im old school fixed lens are better everyone knows that
however in practice i think technology has displaced this old saw
i find that my nikon  zoom is just about as sharp at  as the nikon mm fd edif afs i know heresyeven more so my old version  at mm is every bit as sharp if not more so as the mm fixed at 
same pricesad to say i returned it but kept the  doubler
using it on a  im back at over mm and no question which is faster or sharper
i read the reviews on this set up all i can say is it works for methis lens has no internal auto focus motorso make sure your camera body has one inside
i missed this when ordering
thankfully kehs customer service dan was outstanding in helping me sort through my return
they processed the return quickly and without hasslemy experience with keh  dan was so good that i bought another lens from them without looking anywhere else
absolutely recommend this sellerso far i am disappointed by the resulting images coming out of this lens
in some cases very soft images not as sharp as i thought they would be
i have much better results with my sigma  mm
this may change when i get used to this lens may be
i hope so anyway since i have invested quite a bit on this babyi tried this lens out for a few weeks
i was shooting it on a nikon d
i found the autofocus was too slow for my liking
the image quality was decent but fairly soft wide open
the zoom on this thing is great but the zoom is worthless if you cant get the autofocus to track fast enough for moving objectsanyway if youre looking for a lens with good zoom capabilities and will be photographing mostly still objects than this lens is great
if you plan to shoot sports with fast action you will probably be disappointeda professional looking lensoutstanding quality metal constructionsavedand waited for this lens a long timeit was going to be my all around most used keeperthen heartbreaksoft at all settingspoor image quality with a dvery dissapointedim so sorry i sold the old  dthe refurbished drive i ordered was sent quickly well packaged and shipped correctly
only problem was it didnt work
i had thought that refurbished meant they connected the drive to a test computer and wiped it clean then verified all sectors and each head before it was sold
well  this company had a different definition
i called them and left a message they returned my call and told me that it was part of a large purchase they got to refurbish and it had no rotation
they said they opened it up and manually freed it up put it back together and it then worked ok they said it must have got restuck in shipment and they were going to refund my money
i hope they doi should have known bettermy recommendation is to buy new or buy pulls
once they open a hard drive it usually means very short life at besti have used these model drives before and they work very well and provided years of service
i hope this helpsgood luckit holds a couple of small cards easily but anything too big or thick causes problems
the fold side doesnt expand like the zip side so with a memory case one side is much larger and may cause trouble zipping
ok for nowwe bought ours a couple of years ago when it was the only affordable dvdvhs combo at our local electronics store
almost immediately we noticed that some dvds would have trouble playing
having nothing else to play them on we assumed that it was the disks
we even took some dvds back to the store and exchanged them as damaged
since then weve found that disks that wouldnt play on the samsung will play other peoples machines without any trouble
running a head cleaner doesnt make any difference
were looking for something new now and trying not to make the same mistakewhen it works which is most of the time its great
but when it does act up it really ruins the eveningi bought the dx about a month ago and was immediately impressed with the quality of the photos and extreme ease of use
i had done fair amount of research and determined that this unit was the best bang for the buck in the  megapixel digital camera price range
i even added the docking station which is a nice convenience to recharge the batteries and transfer images with no hassleanother selling point for me was the video mode which works very well no this is not camcorder quality for quick clips of my son that i can save or email
it would be nice to have an option to at least use the x optical zoom why not
to bring the action a little closer but it is what it ishowever it did not take long to realize that there was a problem
the battery life would ususally only last for  shots than just die without warning
i tried leaving it on the charger longer but the same thing kept happeningsometimes even worse
i figured that unit must be defective so i took it back for a replacement
the new unit worked only marginally better for the first day but then started acting just like the other one
major inconveniencei would expect to be able to shoot at least  shots with the lcd screen in use before the batteries flopped but no such luck
i have even been careful to shut it off when i was not about to use it again immediately
often times it would just not turn on againi have read reviews from many others who have had similar problems but i am not willing to deal with kodak to try fixing it
it is truely a shame because it is so very simple to operate and the picture quality is excellent
be that as it may i am dumping this unit and buying a canon powershot s elph camera
they are a bit more expensive but seem to offer more for the money including a x optical zoom rather than a x and do not seem to have such reliability problems
also the kodak is definately not pocket sized as is the canon
i wish i could recomment the dx but it just dissapointsim more of an audophile than a videophile so the cd handling was important and thus the reason for the carousel
sound quality is quite good for this level of player with transparent highs and nicely filled out harmonics in the bass range
my quibble is with the carousel
unless you select the repeat mode it only plays one disk and stops
so every time i load cds i must press repeat twice to get it to go through all the disks
even the disk skip button moves it to the next disk but stops playing despite what the owners manual says
and my last quibble is with the buttons on the cd player for repeat random disk exchange and skip disk
although conveniently placed theyre sooo small  about the width of a piece of lead in a wooden pencil
im really worried about theyre longevity in daily use
well thats it
great sound but questionable ergonomicsi bought these headphones  two pair actually  because we live in such a noisy neighborhood and needed to have something to help kill some  music that is played far too loudly so that we could at least watch a movie or listen to music of our own in our own home
without having it supersaturated with the noisome air pollution 
but complaints about my  neighborhood aside these headphones have worked admirably in that regard
i also use them now on the subway to kill a fair amount of the ambient noise and help reduce the air pollution of other less human subway riders who insist on broadcasting their music choice to the entire car
i also take them with me when flying and if that was all i used them for id consider the price well worth it
wow
planes are so loud and these cut out a lot of the noise
and if youre playing your own music while sound cancelling you can pretty well tune out every bit of ambient sound out there
the sound cancelling is also nice in that when using it one does not need to turn the volume up as far as one normally would  thus giving your ears even less noise
when watching movies or listening to music late at night it also means that the volume can be low enough that ones bedneighbor will not need to suffer from noise bleedthroughfidelity the sound quality is okay on these
you wouldnt use them in a recording studio but for tooling around town theyre finecomfort these are not the most comfortable headphones i have owned
they have a silly flat plastic top that does not fit around the head and doesnt have the usual adjustabilty that one finds with headphones nor does the plastic band hold the phones very tightly to ones head so whenever i tip my head say to tie a shoe or pick something up they slide off
however though they couldnt manage to get a snug fit on the head these have a wondrous too snug fit on the ears that becomes uncomfortable after a whilequality of craftsmanship this is where these lose the possibilty of earning five stars
the plastic band holding the earcups together is built somewhat flimsily with no backup support
mine are already cracked from spreading the earcups apart only a smidgen more than their normal rest position
they fold up nicely into a small package but there are a number of little hinges all plastic that im sure will wear out in the next year and cause these to fall apart completely
for a special kind of product  that is not a regular cheap headphone  i wish aiwa had made something substantially sturdier
for the price i actually was quite surprised at the cheapness of the plastic housing the entire uniti do recommend these but with the caveat that you will need to be more careful with them and also the issues of fitting on the head
as stated for tooling around town watching a movie so as not to disturb your partner and for airplanes theyre just fine
noise cancelling headphones in general area an awesome idea
you could definitely do better than these but for the price these are a good dealin my job i deal with a variety of noisy servers everything from u servers to processor beasts
these industrial servers generate a considerable amount of noise
and like many others i fly a good bit
considering this i desperately wanted a decent pair of headphones
i found the aiwa hpcnthese headphones are an open type of headphones but they do cut background noise even without turning on the noise canceling
they also come with an adapter to fit the two prong airline jacks and a travel bagwithout any ambient background noise the headphones produce a deep toned white noise
when i was in a quiet room i found myself turning the noise reduction feature off more often than not
while i felt that that the overall noise reduction wasnt up to the  that the packaging claimed but it is noticeableaudio clarity and quality is excellentthe noise canceling feature of the headphones does work but not quite as well as i had hoped
given its internal power source  aa battery its possible to use the headphones without being plugged in to anything however the external sounds are replaced with a steady hiss similar to that of an old tapedeck at the end of a tapeone personal complaint about the headphones is that the padding on the headphones sit and press on the ear rather than enveloping the ear like the much more expensive bose version
given my particular earshape that creates a pinch point which is highly uncomfortable after an hours weari have yet to try these on an airplane train or bus but they do effectively cancel out the hiss of the air vents in my office and the air conditioning units outside my office
and peoples voices and other noises can be completely cancelled out using a much lower volume of music saving my eardrums some wear and tearif i was to purchase another set of headphones id definitely look for noise cancelation as a feature but i wouldnt pick this exact modelupdate ok  ive had these for a few weeks now and they still pinch and hurt i had hoped my ears would be desensitized by now
but the noise cancelation still makes them favorable to headphones without
for example a portable compressor just started up outside our building and by turning the noise cancellation on i was able to block it to a level where i could ignore it  in fact i couldnt tell when they shut the compressor offthe camera was listed as acceptable but the one i received used obviously was a little more banged up than i had hoped for
rubber around the eyepiece is split and coming off no user manual which is not good with a camera with this many functions and capabilities no usb cable dead batteries not that big of a deal and seems to have a few performance issuesthe lcd screen on mine flutters at times between color and black  white like its going out
sometimes when pressing the shutter release it simply doesnt take a picture
try it again and it does
the lcd screen on the dimage  is also very small
i realize this is one of the first digital slrs on the market and if you look at the backside image on amazon it does look pretty small but in person its really small
also and this is probably due to when it came out after you take a photo it doesnt stay on the lcd screen to look at
you have to switch modes and manually look at the photo
again due to when this model came out no big deal but if it matters to you just be aware of it
just realize that if you do load the photo onto the screen to look at it its really smallmine came with a camera bag and  sd cards which is nice
overall it looks like it has been through a lot in the past and im just hoping it will hold out for at least a year
the main reason i purchased this camera was to use it with ahoya mm rm infrared filterso i at least hope it works well with that once i order itthe is an awesome digital camera that often takes photos of better quality than mm film camerasthe  things that i cant stand about the camera  power hog  when using high capacity nickel metal hydride batteries they only last about  to  pictures  depending on the resolution that youre using the autofocus and the flash
dont even think about using the rear display screen
the power indicator often indicates a low battery when in fact you may have  or more shots left
i use  sets of batteries
the electronic viewfinders pixelated resolution makes it difficult to tell whether the subject is in focus
the autofocus can be infuriatingly slow at times sometimes cant focus and sometimes tells you that the subject is in focus when its not i mostly use the focus by wire focusing ring for manual focus  the neck strap attachment ring on the right side of the camera gets in the way of opening and closing the compact flash door just annoyingdont even think of downloading pics through the supplied usb cable very slow
i highly reccommend the zio usb cf reader transfer rates of mbsstill its the highest quality camera for the buck right nowi use this camera at work often on occasions when i am sent on assignments i didnt know about when i went home the evening priorthis is not my favorite camera for a number of reasons
what bothers me most is the view i receive through the viewfinder
the viewfinder is small to begin being only about one square inch
the views are often clouded in shades of red gray or black also not what you look at with the naked eyeturning the camera in half like the photo on this page does not improve matters
i find this camera somewhat difficult to manage with controls being tiny and that abominable viewfinder constantly creating problems for meit does take fine pictures however and transferring them from the camera to a pc or other media is simply a matter of plugging in and pushing a button
so it does the job well
if only it was an equal pleasure while i was using it i could rate this betteri am hereby changing my review of this camera
i use this camera on a daily basis at work work is a camera store
i originally gave it a star review but after comparing it to the coolpix  the predecessor to this camera which i used to own and playing with the new canon g i have found myself highly unimpressed by the maybe its the fact that the  had a different lens a x the  has a x i dont know
i do know that the quality of the pictures is not nearly as good as those from the   i liked the picture quality of the  but i sold it because i wanted several things it couldnt offer
i wanted an onboard hot shoe and i wanted a camera that had available accesories that didnt cost an arm and a leg
maybe im crazy but paying more than a few dollars for a stupid cable to attach my flash to the camera seems absurd
i sold the  before the  came out and when it did come out i was hoping for some changes which if had been made might have convinced me to buy a   unfortunately nikon didnt make those changesthe manual controls are still tricky and annoying to use compared to the canon gs at least which are laid out in a very easy to use and understand way
why nikon insists on making manual control so convoluted is beyond me its completely unnecessary
its things like this that make people who are new to digital want to turn away from it
here is nikons method of manual control  flip the power switch to quotmquot  push in and hold the quotmodequot button
while holding the quotmodequot button turn the control dial until the lcd screen displays the mode you wish ie
quotmquot for manual  let go of the quotmodequot button
now when you turn the dial your shutter speed changes
quotoh i want to change the aperturequot  press in the quotmodequot button to switch to aperture
turn the dial to change aperture
quotoh i want to change shutt  oh darn my subject moved
too late
oh wellquotnow heres manual control on the canon  flip the control dial to quotmquot  control pad on the backupdown to control aperture leftright to control shutter speed
the nikon  has a pad like this on the camera why isnt it optimized for this useno onboard hot shoe for the flash
still no antiglare coating on the screen seeing the screen outside in the sun is impossible without sticking one of those annoying screenhoods on it
as for image quality i find the that image quality isnt as good as the   its visibly less sharp than the   i did some tests at the store and the color correction is also pitiful
i did a sidebyside comparison of the  and another highend camera people often ask to see the canon g
i took the same pictures with both cameras using the same settings and printed an xquot from each
the gs color correction was far more accurate plus the pictures were sharp from edge to edge
the nikon was sharp in the middle and fuzzy in the corners
even my coworkers the majority of whom are nikonians agreed the the g took a much better picture
both cameras were set exactly the same auto focus auto white balance timer exposure as to avoid camera shake no flash
and before you say quothey youre comparing apples and oranges  megapixel cameras and  megapixel camerasquot keep in mind that a  megapixel camera is very well capable of producing a very sharp xquot print which i have printed from the original  model
an xquot should be no problem for a  megapixel camera therefore i feel it is fair to compare it to a camera of equal or higher resolutionto top it all off nikon still refuses to bundle some decent software with their cameras
nikon view is awful
for the price of the  they should at least bundle something like adobe photodeluxe
canon is generous enough to include copies of adobe photoshop le with the gin closing i highly recommend you check out the canon g
nikon is coming out with a new model the  which is supposed to be much better than the  but if it were me buying it id still stick with the g because overall ive been more impressed with canons line of digital cameras
they must be doing something rightafterall nikon pretty much stole the gs design for their new cp  model go see for yourselffirst digital
good pictures  when you have the time to wait for the camera to power up and dont mind a considerable shutter lag time  no real problem with the pictures but the start up time and shutter lag time wereare incredibly frustrating
i went back to a film camera because of those two problems  when taking grab shots  and for the complete control i get with a mm slr when taking serious photography shots
for a point and shoot quick grab the shot camera it just doesnt get it
on its behalf it is one of the earlier point and shoot digitals
they have come a long way since this one
get a newer model and some of the problems have been cured
after about a three year lay off of digital cameras i just got back into the digital point and shoot cameras with a canon a
it is far superior to the   this camera just cant keep up with the grandkids  or any other quick shoot situation
i still have the  and will use it occassionally  within its limitations again the pictures are ok  not pro quality but ok but there are better cameras out therei obviously didnt expect a camera that is a fraction of the price of the  to match it in quality however i did expect better than this
the camera has positives and negativespositivesa  as with all nikon digitals as of yet you cant beat the macro modeb
the camera comes with a rechargable lithiumion battery
however in a pinch you can walk into pretty much any drugstore or camera store and purchase a cr battery that will also run the camera thats one positive this camera has over the comparable canonc
nice small bodynegativesa  image quality isnt fantastic
ive seen other  megapixel digicams that blow this away specifically the olympus  and nikons coolpix b
body is all plastic
some see this as a positive because it decreases the weight however i like something made of metal because its generally more sturdy and the weight doesnt really bother mec
the lcd screen is fairly smalld
to attach the accessory lenses you have to use a very chintzy goofy looking adapter the ure
it wraps around the whole camerae
only comes with an mb card comes on nikonmb isnt enough for anyonef
i have yet to see a nikon come with a good software package and this camera is no exception
in terms of the software you get with digital cameras the stuff olympus and canon bundle with their cameras blows away the stuff nikon includesits decent but for the money you could probably do much better
if the size of the camera isnt important there are other mp cameras in the same price range that are a little bigger but much betterwhile this camera does an acceptable job you can probably do better for the money
the auto setting is very misleading
it is really more of a manual setting
i have been using a milota camera for years and find it took better quality pictures with less need for adjustment
a friend told me that he has two relatives who actually returned nikon digital cameras after initial useit seems like a great camera but the previous reviewer is right about the lens
i liked the feature of the f  lens for low light situations
the barrel distortion however is awful
i rejected this camera
i was ready to order one and went to circuit city to look at one
i checked out a post in the viewscreen and it was bowed as i panned to each extremei am back looking at other camerasmany people have written wonderful reviews of the c
i have to say that i agree with most of them  this is a great camera with wonderful functionsunfortunately theres something most people have overlooked about this digicam
the lens is so flawed that ill go as far as to say the c delivers worse photos than the old c
before you doubt me completely hear me outmost digital cameras suffer from something called quotbarrel distortionquot at the wideangle setting and quotpincushion distortionquot at the telephoto setting
what this means is if you take a picture of a house and look closely at the sides of the house the upanddown lines of the sides of the house will quotbendquot outward at wideangle and quotbendquot inward at telephoto
on some digicams you can barely see this distortion without a magnifying glass
but with the c the barrel distortion at the wideangle setting is so bad it actually makes it look like buildings are being squeezed from above and the sides are bending outthis isnt a problem if you never use the lens at wideangle or if you never take a photo of something with lines that go straight up and down but i take photos of buildings on a regular basis
i upgraded from a c to a c a month ago
although the c delivers higher resolution photos than the c the barrel distortion on the c was so bad that i took it back to the store and went back to using my cunless you need a megapixel camera for x prints or larger dont get this camera
get a c or c and youll be much happier
trust me
if you do get a c use the lens in the middle range
dont ever go wide or tele because upanddown lines will bend one way or the otheri think a lot of people will give this thing  stars cause it holds a lot  but you know that already and its absurd to write about that
so ill just get this out of the way  yes this card is  megs
yes it holds a lotnow as for its quality i use this card in my powershot s digital camera and have had some problems with it occassionaly it has caused the camera to give an error when it starts up
the card seems to go through bad streaks in which every picture i put on it gets corrupted for maybe  pics in a row then it works fine again
besides this problem i probably lose  in  to  pictures due to data corruptionpersonally i take several pictures of any given object and if one gets lost its no big deal
so this occasional data loss has not really been a problem for me
if the pictures or data you will store on this are very important you may want to think twice before buying a vikingi have also used this in my sharp zaurus and it has never caused any problems thereill give it  stars because most of the time it works fine and the problems i have had with it havent been anything seriousi have to start with saying that i am pleased with the range of this smc pc card
i can work downstairs while my access point is upstairs and have no problemseven when the signal is only fair or poor
doesnt work at all when i am on my cordless phone but i guess that should be expectedbutthe card does freeze occasionally on my compaq and often on my wifes dell
it will be working and then become unlinked and the computer will freeze  seconds work  seconds and repeat until i rebootall while the card has stopped working
i emailed smc support heard nothing back
i tried to call and the wait was over  minutes
so i am fairly disappointed with thisi am a college student and bought this card to split between the smc router i have for myself and the cisco wireless network we have on campus
this does not work with the cisco aironet network i tried and tried and nothing could be done to fix this
besides that though its a great bargain of a card and worked flawlessly with the smc routermy smcawbrsmcw combo does not provide adequate coverage of my  sq ft apartment which is somewhat disapointing
testing at the office shows the lucent cards to have much better range than the smc cardi have a dual booting compaq presario with win me and win  installed
when i received the card i installed it in my windows me configuration and everything went smoothly surfing the web within minutesthen i went on trying to intall it into win  which will not work
i tried downloading the newest software and utility to no avail
everytime i call tech support i wait on hold for  minutes and when a rep eventually picks up they are rude and no help
one of reps that handled my call i could hear them munching chips down their throats and not caring of helping you
all that guy wanted me to do was to move the folder of where the downloaded drivers were on my desktop to the root directory and had me try reinstalling
another rep just suggested to reinstall win  which i did many times even before calling customer rep  it is pitiful that smc has such bad customer repsi have received the card for about  days now and still not able to get it to work in win i also purchased the barricade wireless router wprinter server and that have been working great with my desktop and wireless laptop using win me
if you plan to use it with win  dont even bother buying this cardits just okay the microphone is not as good as the included mike in dragon which is disappointing
for voip it works well
its way too bulky though
could have been made a lot lighterthey are flimsy cheap and sound just ok  be reminded that this requires an output plug for the headphone part and an input plug for the mic
you cant use on a macbook air or pro with only one plug for the mic  headphone inout
i didnt know that so was not able to use on my apple product
however its not much to use at any rate and money could be better spent on a product that is a bit more expensive and better qualityi bought these to use as on my laptop with dragon speech recognition
they are pretty flimsy and they dont adjust well
but i did not pay much for them so i cant complaini ordered this as an alternative to the headset provided by dragonit seem much slower than dragons and less accurate
ive done more training with this than the provided headset
there might be a good alternative but this is not itits ok the cord is noticeably longer
the look and feel is more solid than dragons headset
so its a mixed bagits hard to find a good headset without spending too much
i chose this one because i was looking for a headset which only covered one hear so i could still hear other things in the room while talking with friends on skype
i have not used this headset for anything other than skype but using skype my friends voices sound faint even with my computers volume turned all the way up and they sometimes need me to repeat what i am saying as well
there is a little bit of static too but that is at a minimum
while this headset functions sufficiently for me the quality isnt quite what i am looking for so i will likely replace it with a more expensive headseti read other reviews panning the headphones that are packaged with dragon and recommending these
they do work well
but i wish the headset itself were a little more adjustable for comfortable wear
theyre not uncomfortable but they could be better  theyre just a little too stiffthe package came in properly packaged
it is and does exactly as the detailed description said it would
i have been enjoying the product and look forward to buying more items in the futureok for a nonusb unituse it with an older pcmainly for dragon naturally speakingworks fine reasonable pricehad to send back the first one
didnt work
second one worked  sort of
the plug in connections were reversed and the in was the out and the out was the in
but heh it works so thats good enough for mei guess sometimes one assumes too much and this was the case in this headset i assumed it was a usb cable and found out later that i now have to disconnect my computer speakers to use thisrating this speech recognition computer headset isnt easy because i couldnt tell wheter the one that came with the program was better or not
it was purchased because the packaging of te program didnt say one way or another if there was headset inside
but this i will say it is good for a second pairsound quality is a bit low
but it is a good product for the price
sound cancellation is not as good as it could be eitherbought this for my sister for skype and any other reasons she might need a mic
talked to her while she was using it and her voice sounded okay but background noises are easily picked up and sound pretty bad on thisif she ever needs another microphone in the future i would probably be more inclined to go with a more expensive headset unless lack of funds are holding me backkoss headphones are middle of the road for quality
they dont make them like they used to
for the price ish these are just okay
i wouldnt buy them again but theyre not so bad that i would bother to pay to send them backi use this for dragon naturally speaking transcription
the weakness of this headset is the locks or detents on adjustable pieces
they were unsatisfactory from the beginning and i ended up taping and gluing the adjustments in the best place
it works ok now but i would not purchase againi didnt want to spend a lot on something i would not use all that often so based on the reviews i picked these out
they arrived quickly and as far as quality there are no problems
the one problem i have however is that they are very uncomfortable and dont fit well
you get what you pay for and for that reason i really shouldnt complain but i would not recommend these to anyone who plans to use them a lot due to fit and comfort
otherwise a good inexpensive headsetbought this to help teach an online course
the sound quality was good with no real areas of complaint
however the head piece snapped within one hour of use as i was taking it off
its still usable but i have to be very careful with it
it was cheap so i guess you get what you pay fori needed a single speaker headset to be able to listen to other people in the room as well as those talking to me on my computeri plugged it into a usb converter plug and it works welluseful when using dragon naturally speaking
i would imagine its good for internet phones but i havent used that in about  years
seller refunded fast so no complaints theresound is decent mic is terrible
if it was free to send back and buy something else i would
not worth the hassle thoughthese are pretty normal
the mic works great
by looking at the headphones youd think that theyd be killer for multimedia and have a lot of bass and stuff
they dont
even though theyre huge their pretty comfortable and theyve got decent volume
the cord is long which is important when they have to reach behind your computer so you dont have your forhead pressed to the monitortdk said that you could have made upgrades in the future like the soul and the riovolt but then they found out that the mojo which is the oem of the exonion avin did not had any
also i was tempted to buy the exonion in germany for the same price plus it had rechargable batteries a remote control carrying case and a built in recharger which the mojo does not have cheap tdk
the exonion also have a remote and tdk took that away
i was tempted to return the mojo but then if i had to return a product bought in germany because defective is a pain in the neck
anyway a part tdk being a rip off cheap company that had an oem product and did not know what specifications and features it had the mojoexonion is a good player loud music easy to read display and nice features
too bad tdk ruined a  star product removing the recharger for the batteries the remote and the protective caseciao aldogiven the price i really wanted to like this monitor
unfortunately i found the text to contain shadows and working with this display gave me headaches after only a short period
images looked fine but text no matter how big or small contained shadows and seemed slightly out of focusi tested this monitor on three separate machines a macintosh g an ibm t laptop and a custom built pentium iii box
all support the monitors native resolution
on all three the text was shadowy and difficult to scan
no amount of adjusting the display or the display cards eg scan rate solved the problem
reading pages of black text on white backgrounds was difficult and made my eyes hurta few general comments the cord between the power brick and the display is too short to reach the floor
as a result the power brick must sit on the desktop taking up some of the very space that the lcd monitor is supposed to free
the lack of a digital input may be an issue for some but shouldnt be a problem for users who simply want to stroll the internet and browse documents
the lack of a second input is only an issue for those who need to easily switch the monitor between multiple machinesthe topmounted control buttons arent nearly the problem some reviews suggest  theyre very easy to memorize and since you only use them occasionally its nice to have them outside your regular visual range
like manymost lcds this one is noticably brighter at the bottom than at the top
some macs such as the beige g minitower for example will require an adapter to plug this into your display port
its not included or sold by envision though their tech support answered my email quickly with a concise and accurate answergiven the positive reports from others im more than willing to believe that either my machines had mediocre display card technology though i find it especially difficult to believe for the t given the high quality of its own lcd display or i simply received a bad sample of the envision monitor
either way id suggest buying this from a merchant such as amazoncom with a liberal return policythe picture is fairly sharp although mine had one stuck pixel in the middle
i could not fault the overall picture qualitythe aspect ratio is not  this is good as it compensates for the odd ratio of  x  but is a bit of a surprise and will distort your picture if you run at any other resolution not that you shouldhowever the monitor seems fairly poorly finished and does not feel good quality
i had to return mine as the backlight would not stay on  you had to turn it off and on again to get it to come onyou get what you pay for i think this monitor is cheap rather than good valuei bought a pair of these pyle plx speakers to replace the defective door speakers in my  grand am
installation was fairly easy the speakers are a direct fit into the factory brackets but the wiring needed some modification since the grand am doesnt use standard connectors
i ended up soldering some of the pyle cable which is merely adequate to the end of the factory harness
sound is okay
these speakers have very little bass response compared to the factory speakers and they bottom out and make cracking sounds with anything but the quietest bass lines or drum beats
midrange arent too bad but the highs are fairly harsh
i ended up splicing a pair of uf capacitors into the positive wire to filter out bass below about hz to stop the speakers distorting
quality control however isnt that hot
one is definitely quieter than the other and when swapping them lefttoright the difference follows the speakers
but for under  theyll do until i can afford something of higher qualitythis is a good speaker to use as a front speaker
it produces nice clear highs and midrange however there is practically no bass response
must be used with a larger cone woofer or subwoofer
not the cheapest and not the most expensive but thought i would get lower tones from itbought them and installed
after one day i heard vibration in there
looked and discovered that one of the wires for the tweeter came loose and was just bouncing inside the speaker
basically cheap construction
buy something better qualityreplaced my jensen speakers on my bike with these but put the jensens back after a week better sound
dont waste yuor money or timewell i was hoping for something louder
wishful thinking
the speakers look great but doesnt deliver the sound depth or volume i wanted
sensitivity on these speakers must be low since pyle didnt specify the db level
ill keep these to use for a future projectsound quality stinkshard to work the button fuctionsvery portable and hands off driving are the best featuresi like this product but had to return it because the speakers system in the handheld did not work
but amazon was great and return the product with no problems definitely will buy cobra againthe speaker is very bad
if you try to communicate it is hard to understand any one
most people do not us e the cb any longer anyhowyes the antenna works
does both cb and the weather bands just as advertised
it is not too well made since the grommet at the base of the antenna came loose the first time that it was used
some gorilla glue restored it back to serviceneeded to be tuned as most do
i actually took it off the mag base and attached antenna to windshield frame on my jeep
good results again for the price its worth itnothing special about this unit
i would have liked the insulating base to be of better material
im afraid that the thin silicon membrane will tear easily and was better secured to the magnetic base
removing the unit from your vehicle to clean or wax the vehicle causes the membrane to detatch and its so thin tearing may be an issuealso basic instructions on how to tune your antenna to your radio using a swr meter would have been goodit should be noted that you can pick up this exact antenna for the same price at any truck stopnot a great range booster from this antenna but better then a standard handheld antennas range
sticks to the car just fine nothing great about it but well designed just the samei exchanged an audiovox d for this model
ive had it several months now and it works greatmost of the time
however on a recent plane trip i watched a movie for  hours then had to change dvd discs
when i put in the nd disc it started skipping and freezing
i think it was because the unit had gotten hot
as long as you dont stop the player before the movie is over and then restart it again it seems to work finei also had some brief freezing issues with a new dvd recentlyoverall i think its a good value for the moneyi bought this unit from amazon a few months ago because i was looking for a lowcost portable dvd player with a widescreen
the player works great but just be aware that the screen is as such the actual screen size is much smaller than a  or  player with a  screenalso another minor thing that bugs me is that in spite of having a remote control you cannot control the volume from the remotethis does get the same
channels but it loses the memory when your batteries go dead
i get only a few days from my rechargeable option batteries
then i have to reprogram again
thats a painthis player has come down in price almost  since i bought it  year ago
it has superb picture quality and sound quality when playing either cds or dvds
the features are unmatched in this price range and all work really well
occasionally not on all dvds i have noticed it hesitate in the middle of moving from one chapter to the next but i have also seen this problem on most dvd players my friends have  some of those players are a lot more expensive than this one too
navigation is easy either with the remote or the onunit controls
both give you quick access to the features you want
it will autopower off if you leave the tray open and always shuts the tray when it turns off
the drive inside this thing is ultraquiet
the remote is probably one of the easiest to use  im almost sad to be replacing it and the other  i have with a universal learning remote
i really bought this unit for its assortment of compatibility with dvdvcdcd mp cdr dvdr and cdrw as well as the impressive stats for the mhz video dac khzbit audio converter optical and coaxial digital audio outputs with dolby digital and dts channel passthrough componentvideo compositevideo and svideo terminals
all of which live up to their claims
unfortunately macrovision protection prevented me from copying dvds to video tape for playing on my kids tvvcr combo  oh wellso the only real disappointment is the mp playback
the manual comes with a detailed explanation of the limitations of the mp playback
mp cds must be mb use dosstyle  names and files cannot be listed in subdirectories
it also does not extract id tags so you are limited to the file name for determining what mp is being selected
you can also only have up to  mp files on any cd you put in the toshiba   i was successfully able to compile an mp cd that met all of these criteria including the kbit khz sample rate and the mp playback was horrible
pops and crackles and a very dull tone made the mp feature useless to me
so instead i have a creative nomad now
still highly recommended for dvds  hopefully my next dvdmp cd player will be betterthese headphones are not very expensive
dont expect the sound quality you would get from koss or sienhoffer headphones that cost upwards of 
the bass is a little high but that can be fixed with an equalizer
the headband could use some padding but ive worn them for several hours at a stretch and never had a problemi use these with my laptop computer to listen to mps while i work
ive also sat through dvds on plane trips with them
for the price they are a good buywhy  stars
these headphones do not have the sound quality of more expensive models but the price is good and the quality is fine
they could stand to be a bit more comfortable but at this price i dont mind sticking them in a laptop bag and risk having them broken because i can replace them cheaplyi at one point was giving these headphones stars
after my probably third pair in  years im not so happy with the durability any longer
i dont recall the headphones breaking this quickly before but it seems that the wiring isnt as good possibly
i just replaced my last pair and do not plan to get another pair again anytime sooneven though i really like the design of these for running since they dont fall out of your ears
the last pair i purchased the right ear keeps cutting in and out with sound frustrating when you want to work out and not mess around with headphonesi buy one of these every year
they are cheap but effective
recommended for light use but they are pretty fragilei need the cord to be about  feet  this cord is only  feet
i also would like to have volume control
i dont think these fit in the ears very well
i only bought these because i was desperate since i dont like anything currently on the market
i also own sennheiser px  headphones which do have volume control but also have a cord that is too short
i wish panasonic still made the lightweight intheear headphones rphs no longer availablethe question how cheap can you make headphones that are perfectly adequate
has been answeredi just about cried when my original folding yellow sony walkman headphones finally failed
imo they reached the level of worship previously reserved only for the radio shack minimus bookshelf speaker of the s i still regularly use a pair in the annals of retrogrouch bargainaudio lorei then actually did cry when i read the reviews regarding structural and sound quality of the currently available crop of folding units
oh wellthese nonfolders received decent soundquality reviews from others and earn a threestar ok rating from me for the expected tinniness
their construction almost defies the laws of mechanical physics
so light you forget they exist and the overhead band is so thin the amount of inear pressure is absolutely minuscule  a good thingive had them for several months now and they have yet to snap in half which honestly was my first expectation
and with no volume adjuster to invariably fail they may just be the perfect cheap virtually disposable lightweight headphones
just treat them gently and they should last a good long while
and if they do fail you probably wont feel like you lost an old friendsony ultra lightweight vertical intheear headphones are uncomfortable in my ears and will not stay in position on my head so that the sound is unbalanced
oddly enough when i lay down with them on they work very well
that said i am a very restful sleeper and move very little during my nighti was sure it would break in a week because of the cheap feel you get just wearing them but hey theyre still around and fitwork fine
the sound is super weak thoughthese have become much more expensive since i bought them
my initial decision to buy them was primarily influenced by their low price and the quality was commensurate with the price
i hope something has changed to make them worth this cost
i used them primarily for running i prefer overthehead inear phones when im running and they only lasted a few months probably due to the jostling and sweat
i would not recommend them at the current pricegranted my boys are not the gentlest but these headphones did not last long
im really not sure if its the headset or my soni bought this headphone to use with my ipod classic
it is well made and the sound was fine but i had a hard time keeping it on my head and in my ears but that is just me
i havent found ear buds or in the ear headphones which will fit that i am comfortable using
so if you do not have a problem with this type of headphones then you would probably like these just finethe good news is that these nearly weightless headphones sound great and will actually stay in the ears of those of us who cant seem to master ear buds and seriously whats up with those anyway
the bad news is that ive yet to have a pair of these last longer than about  months before one channel usually the left goes deadthe lightweight wires are so insubstantial that a short circuit is guaranteedand i have yet to be able to take things apart and patch them into working order again
so by all means buy these for small relatively comfortable goodsounding headphones especially nice in the gym  but understand that its basically a disposable and wont last longthe product is shipped from a company called limited goods
due to a postal mixup it was lost in transit for a bit
a very helpful gentleman named nathan emailed me first to check on the delivery then followedup with me every step of the way to ensure i received it to the point of offering to ship me another one
it arrived and all was well
the company was very gracious and the experience was quite positiveas for the headphones themselves i agree with other reviewers that the sound quality is excellent and truly surprising considering the reasonable price
ive always trusted sony products and this was no exception
it is also super lightweight with comfortable ear pieces which really attracted me to it in the first placemy problem with it is try as i may i just cant get the offbeat shapedesign of it to fit to my head or in my ears
due to other reviewers not having issues with it i can only conclude that this particular shapestyle just isnt for me and ill choose a different headphone in the sony family
this made it hard to review the product since it works beautifully but the shape of it wont work for everyonei replaced my jvc sport clip earbuds with the sony mdrwl headphones
the jvc sport clip earbuds sounded awful so i wrote a review on them and sent them back to amazon
i read all of the glowing reviews for these and it really got my hopes up but even though these sound much better than the jvc sport clips the bass is still disappointing
i listen to anything from hard rock to hip hop and the bass is there which is more than the jvcs had to offer but it is still lacking
ive never owned a pair of earbuds before the jvcs so maybe im just expecting too much sound from such tiny speakers
i guess what im really looking for is covertheear sound from an intheear product and im not even sure it exists
the volume level from my sansa clip zip is very strong however and they are quite comfortable to wear for long periods so that is a plusif i had to break down the quality of each feature it would look like this with  being the worst rating and  being the bestoverall sound bass level comfort overalll rating if these had cost any more than the  i paid i would be returning them but i will keep using them until i find something better
if youre really looking for a full bass sound with clear mids and highs you will most likely want to search elsewhere
if youre looking for comfort and secure earbuds to use while on the move with decent sound these might be the right choice for youi received these promptly within  days and couldnt wait to try it on my daily run i as many here hate ear buds as i have to keep pressing them back in and over the ears just shift around
when i first plugged em into my ipod all i got was static and i was pretty pissed i gave it a wiggle and it worked with a little static remaining
i decided what the hell i cant return em now so i gave em a shot and the static cleared completely up and it worked perfectly as soon as i got outside
it was great i didnt have to adjust a thing the entire run
even jumping over pot holes and cobble streets they stayed inuse these for my workouts and they get thrown into my gym bag afterwards
i go through one of these almost every  months
they are not extremely durable because the wire leading into the earbuds eventually becomes loose and i end up losing sound in one ear bud if not two usually
unfortunately i am one of those who cannot use ear buds while working out because they pop out all the time when i run thus im stuck with using over the head headphones
fortunately they are cheap enough you can consider them disposable but it would be really nice if these were more rugged and durable
same problem occurs with other manufacturers of the same style headphone
audio quality is ok not audiophile grade but does the job for a workoutthese headphones after few months the rigth side will stop to workhad  all stopped to work same side dont ask me whya pity cause produce a great soundi was using a pair of sennheiser pxs when mowing or at the gym for the past  years until suddenly one side stopped working
now they cost much more than i paid then about  and even the new pxiis are a little pricey
comparing those to these sonys heres the differencessonys cord is about  shorter
one side gets tugged on a little if i put my mp player in  my sweats pocketsonys are very workout friendly otherwise
sweat wipes off easily when done the pxs i had to blot the ear cushionsthese lack bass
there are parts of songs that im used to hearing that these dont even hint at in the bass region
definitely an airy soundthese are extremely comfortable and stay in place
they dont let sweat pool like the over the ear type did and they dont shift
and best of all they feel like theres nothing at all on my headi paid  for these shipped
not bad although i do miss the cord length and bass
makes me wonder if i shouldve gone with the mdrwv headset
if anyone has compared these two let me know your thoughts
i really like the vertical style now if only i could find some that get down to at least hz and have a  cordive purchased a number of headphones behindtheneck headphones and earbuds
the earbuds become painful after a short period of wearing them some of them fall out easily
many of the headphones feel like vises
other behindtheneck headphones move around too much or become dislodged from my ears when i move my headthese headphones are so lightweight they are barely noticeable
they stay on my head
the left ear piece does however become dislodged enough that i must reposition it
one thing i did not care much for was the fact that i had to turn the volume up quite a bit over other types of headphonesso when the ear pieces stay lodged in the ear canal  and  with the volume turned up these are very comfortable and enjoyablei wear these headphones eight hours a day at work
they are very comfortable however they dont last long
now that the price has risen significantly i certainly wont be buying these again
instead i bought jabaris revo headphones which are very comfortable and meant to lastthe description is accurate these are definitely lightweight headphones
i picked them up for when i am watching videos or listening to music on my computer
the sound quality is good and they are comfortable to wear
my chief complaint is the length of the cord it is very short and i had to pick up an audio extension cable to prevent the cord from draping across my keyboard during usenot bad for the price
im not sure why when i bought these i thought they were behind the ear type headphones but they are not
theyre nice for the gym because they dont have foam pads to get wet and theyre also not too expensive like many of the other options for gym headphones out there
also i find the cable to be just a bit short but it hasnt been a problem for me yetuntra lightweight would be one description flimsy is another
they sound ok but while putting them on or taking them off they bend every which way
they have not broken they just have no physical substanceive owned at least  of these headphones
as others have said theyre great for long runs
however they do tend to break after a few months
i doublechecked my past orders on amazon and as recently as a few months back these same headphones cost under ten dollars
now i see theyre nearly forty
i dont know what changed with amazon target still has them for around twelve dollars but theyre just not worth that priceexcellent product
the sound is something good average to good
they are fairly lightweight
the low depth is not very good
i recommend it for the convenience and light weighti buy these in bulk and last from days to many months
some only play in one ear from the start
im sure everyone knows by now that its due to the thin wires and fragile connection at the plug
what you need to do is wrap  thin rubber bands around the plug area to protect against constant stresses bending and pulling there
if you have the patience and determination when the wires go bad get a  plug from radio shack and cut the old plug off and solder on the new one
this takes some experience but can save plenty headaches over the long run
there are youtube videos on how to do it stars while it works and  star for sony not being able to provide a decent wiring connection
thats why you need to pay attention to the wire thickness and plug size and not just the sound when buying headphonesi want to like these headphones but i find that this earbud style is a bit painful in the ears
i probably in the future will buy a pair of over the ear headphones
all that said these work well and they are really durablethis has a plastic head strap so it cannot be easily adjusted for tension against the head as the old metal ones
i learned to leave it stored curved into a circle with a clip so tension would hold it in my earsfrequency response is limited but what do you expect for this price
i paid  in i just bought my third pair
yes they sound good  yes they are light and are ideal for running
yes they fail in the same way since  or earlier
my first pair lasted many years finally lost one channel
my second pair lasted less than one year lost one channel
my third pairwellsony listen up
its a great product but if you can figure out how to keep the wires connected to the plug id pay the extra  to make that happenupdatei still use these as i hate earbuds for running
my current pair just developed a buzz in the lh earpiece
went to amazon to buy a couple of more sets  discontinued and the remaining old stock is jacked in price by x
ok community whats the best available replacementthe sound is not bad and they are very light but the cord is so short that if you have your player in your pocket and are on the treadmill the cord will get yanked out of the player
this happened to me a few times
if you have your player on an arm band it should be finei had a set of headphones that i loved but the died and ever since i have been on a quest to fnd a replacement
i like the sound that these provide but they are not very comfortable so i can only wear them for short periodsi really liked these but they didnt last more than a few months before one ear stopped working
they dont stay in ear too well either but the sound is pretty okay
they were pretty comfortable though
all in all there are probably better headphones for the price on this siteit is ok but not real sturdy
next purchase will be a stronger and more dependable one
will not get this one againsmc won the battle but lost the war
i bought this unit and used it happily for several months
then cable modem service provider interrupted service and suddenly the smc barricade was never the same
i reset the unit i tried the alternate modem connection option and fried the external modem in the process
i went to the smc site for help and found only a form for posting to tech support
tech support did not respond for over a week
meanwhile neither did amazoncom
i feel burned
so i went to my local store picked up a linksys product live support x
fewer bellswhistles but hopefully more reliable
i like the barricade while it worked
but i wont go there again
ps
 the linksys seems faster model befsr ver
  great instructionsi use my smc barricade extensively as a soho user
i vpn into my corporate network for hours on end
in the evening i like to play zonecom games
i have  pcs i use on my internal networki find the smc barricade adequate but with some serious shortcomings for my use
ill attempt to outline where the barricade falls short but first let me say that if you plan on using this product simply for web or email it will probably do everything you want perfectly
if you are a more advanced user or a soho user please take the following into account
vpn works great
once or twice
then the initial connection slows considerably
then it stops working until you reboot the router
directx or zonecom games will work great a few times
then it stops working until you reboot the router
dhcp works great until you reboot the router
the barricade does no conflict detection before hading out addresses so every time you reboot you will get ip address conflicts
you can not host directx or zonecom games internally despite the dmz feature
i find the best way to cope is to proactively reboot the router every morning before i start using it
then i turn on my machines and everything usually works the reset of the day
but not always
multiple email to smc support has returned not one word
the silence is deafening
i can repro every single problem every day with network traces for them still no response from smclike i said above if all you want is to do simple web browsing this is a great product
if you plan on using any of the more advanced features be prepared to do some configuration work and to reboot this thing at least dailythis router is impressive at the number of attacks it blocks
ive tested it with numerous security websites and it consistently achieves a perfect scorethe webbased interface is easy to use but not very intuitive
the documentation is designed for someone who is already familiar with networking lingo and procedures
for somebody like myself who has not set up a network before it can be a big challenge to muddle through all the requirementsthe tech support is lousy
ive tried the telephone support but get tired of being on hold
email inquiries take a few days for a response and even then they have only answered my question about half the timeconfiguring the router to work with different applications is something youll have to figure out by yourself
i was having problems using outlook and tech support stated that outlook is a nat unfriendly application and that i would essentially have to live with quirky email connectivity
the manual explains how to open up desired ports but not which ports to open for common applications
they provide an example of opening port  for an ftp server but dont tell you that you also need to open port   i had to go to the linksys website to find that info
their instructions for configuring to operate with applications such as msn messenger essentially tell the user to try this and dont come crying to us if it doesnt work  not very impressivei was attracted by the low price and good support reputation of smc
apparently that support is a thing of the past
additionally the  rebate that i submitted back in november has yet to arriveive been using this selector for two years now and it works great until it doesntlately the chroma color has been intermittent on two of the switchesif i push them harder the color will come back but no good to lose color in the middle of a recording
and its not lose plugs  i checked thatat this price ill buy a new one but i imagine an electronicswitching switch if they made one like this would last longerthis is an inexpensive simple switcher that works fine
it tends to move around when the buttons are pressed so get some rubber feet for itit came with  of the  inputs not working but since i only needed  that was fine
otherwise has been a dependable  useful piece of equipmentthis device had all that i wanted for a selector as i attached all my old video game systems to it
included in the list is the nintendo entertainment system super nintendo dreamcast nintendo  and a sega cdx
they all were attached with the av cables that the systems came with and they all worked perfectly
this av selector didnt require any ac adaptor or anything to power it all you need is some regular av cables to hook it up to the tv and then just plug your devices to the selectorwhen the device worked the picture wasnt perfect though for the most part it wasnt that bad
though after just owning it for a couple of months and with not much use it decided to die without any reason
not sure why as i do take good care of all my products though my unit did not function at allfor the price this is an excellent av selector for your switching between devices needs though know that it is always better to have your devices plugged directly to your tv if possible
get it if you really need a selector but know that it might not last longto be honest i did not purchase this product with high expectations
i simply needed an inexpensive way to supply music to various rooms in my house  the garage basement and kitchenfirst the good  its cheap and easy to use
the audio signal it sends to the speakers is decent and better than your average clockradio
in fact it is probably more than adequate for noncritical listeningthe bad  the unit definitely degrades the audio signal
i currently have it connected to four different speakers brands and all of them reflect the same shortcoming a loss of midtoupper range definition and a tendency to give the music a vague hollow sound
the better the speaker the more this will be apparentfor less than  you really cant expect anything better
there is no way i would recommend this unit for a true audiophile
for someone simply wants an inexpensive way to add music to other parts of the house its a cheap way to goi returned this item as once it arrived i determined it would not work with my stereo system
it was my error in not looking at my system prior to ordering
however i do believe it would have been just what i was looking for and was fairly pleased with the qualityi picked up a pair of these at best buy for a pretty good price mostly for watching tv without disturbing the wife late at night and while the quality was good ive been underwhelmed by the sound
i like that theyre closed ive never liked those airy headphones but they dont produce nearly enough bass without having to crank up the bass settings
my major gripe is that although theyre only a couple of years old and havent been used much the synthetic material on the ear cups is flaking off
im looking for a replacement pair and i think ill up my spending limit this timethe minolta s is a fine camera if you can get it for significantly less than its current retail price
the  megapixel resolution makes for some excellent daylight shots and the  second movie recorder renders superb quality avi files
however the camera suffers excessively from camera shake in lowlight conditions
in addition the manual setting for taking shots is difficult to manipulateeven for the intermediate level photographer
nighttime shots suffer from imbalance in color levelsrechargeable nimh batteries are an absolute must for this camera
my unit came with  aa alkaline batteries which expired after roughly  minutes of usage
ive owned my current set of  mah kodak photolifes for roughly a year now and theyve consistently given the camera an operational battery life  days with regular onoff usagewhile the s has a workable zoom it fails to give adequate focus in both automatic and manual modess rendering blurred images  especially to subjects taken with the digital zoomi wont recommend this camera to a firsttime buyeri use these disks only in an old sony mavica camera which is now seldom used
so far the disks from this pack have worked ok but many disks from a prior pack failed and pictures were lost
sony does strongly recommend however that only sony disks be used in the camera so i cant complain if i disobey their recommendations
the disks have all performed as needed in the computer but this is older technology that i dont use anymoregood find hardly have any use for it good price from a well known brand technology is always ahead its oki use the sony camcorder dcrpc to take photos
when i use the mb memory stick it is quick
when i use the mb stick it feels like it is half the speed  that is not good especially if i take continuous snapshots  sony should tell consumers these kind of things
also the camcorder spec says it is good for  megapixel photos
it is a lie
the image quality is like magnifying a  x  to  megapixel
the result is coarse pixelation of the photo i called the sony customer support and they told me quotif it looks good on the view finder then sonys job is donequot  what bs
sony wake up and dont tell liesi think its well worth buying a mb or even better this mb memory stick with a new sony camera thats what i did but i dont see any reason to pay the premium in price between the sony version and those made by competitors like lexar scandisk and otherssony will tell you that part of the speed of the camera depends on the way the incamera computer can access the memory card but i have read articles that say that is just a tiny piece of the equation
and from experience i can say that i see no difference in quality between my sony card and the one from lexarin the end i give this card only three stars for reasons not related to quality but to price
these memory sticks have become simple commodities like rice or cement and the deciding factor in any comparison shopping should be price
i would and do pay extra for sony quality when it comes to digital cameras and other hightech equipment but i dont see a reason for it when it comes to memory sticksi bought this for the tj
it may be overkill but what the heckit does put a drain on the tj
have not played with it too much to gage the losshowever it is nice for a quick backup especially if you are going through an airport
a wand wave in india once wiped the memory on a palmit is costly and the main reason for the lower score
of course the sales happen after i buy but it does the job and i have tons of room especially for those large games you dont want to tossthe mouse works ok  if you want a trackball  where you dont move the mouse to move the cursor but move the thumb ball to navigate the screen
i was specifically in the market for an optical mouse  one that does not use a rollerball on a mouse pad but uses reflected light under the mouse to navigate
calling this an optical mouse is misleading  make sure a trackball is what you want when you buy thismany trackball or mouse users have very specific preferences and theres no reason to believe that one size fits all is a valid concept
with the trackman everything looks great and may even feel great when sampling it in the showroom
the trackball fits ergonomically over your hand the clicking is very easy and it looks good to boot
personally ive heard a number of positive firsthand accounts of people who have used this device
perhaps it might prove instructive to some how the experience of one user wasnt as positivemy first difficulty pertained to tracking it simply took too much efffort to navigate from one part of the screen to another a real problem if you have a  screen or larger
a software update improved things somewhat but not enough for the kind of convenience you get from kensington products
and then there was the tracking itself for an optical mouse the movement was not particularly smooth
the software didnt catch some kinds of navigation making movement even more difficultafter sampling the product extensively i came to realize that it was severely handicapped compared to kensington products which allow a range of tracking styles speeds and customization
if designers were to develop some kind of fix this trackball might offer serious competitionthat said i strongly recommend trying a number of devices at a computer store to see if their feel is appropriate to your work style
a number of vendors allow a moneyback policy for the first week even with a restocking fee it saves having to keep all but what you really need
you even might fall in love with the trackman after alli bought this just about july    its now december    technically the mouse is still usable and functioninghowever its showing those signs that its about to become trash
noticeably its starting to do that thing where it randomly doubleclicks instead of singleclicks
this is not a software or hardware problem or anythingits that sign that the mouse is getting to be trashi got the mouse to replace a microsoft mouse which had five buttons and a trackball and it was fun and stuff
on amazon that mouse seems to go for over  dollars so screw that
i dont know how long itll take but i feel this mouse might end up dying soon so i label it as  years goingits fun its easy its reliable
for cleaning though its not as easy as the microsoft one
the ball doesnt come out easily so you have to reach under it and shove it out with a prodding object and it gets a lot more filthy in there than the microsoft mouse
updatei bought another one on september   it is now november  and the same problem has recurred with another onethis is the best ergonomic trackball bar none
itll fix your carpal tunnel and make your clickwork much faster once you get accustomed to it
its optical makes use of rather than forces you to work around your thumb is deadly accurate and easy to clean and has a very nice fit and finishat the same time im on my fourth in five years
its a bit frustrating that the buttons wear out stop registering clicks accurately over and over again while the rest of the device remains useful
before the optical trackman series of devices i used a threebutton logitech mouse for over a decade and without any noticeable button issues
to make matters worse the latest replacement apparently has a new usb chip because it suffers from continuous random disconnects after which the trackball must be removed and plugged back in
bring back the old quality logitechif they could make the buttons last longer these devices would merit  stars from mebought this for a second computer and after hooking it up i realized there were no back or forward buttons which for me is not good
it is easy to use but lacks in overall function as opposed to what i am used tothis is a replacement for my yearold logitech trackball that finally started acting up
it has the usual high technical quality that i have come to expect from logitech
ball control is smooth and easy with no rough spots
the driver is easy to install
the only problem i have is that the buttons are too sensitive
just resting my fingers lightly on them sometimes causes them to click
the buttonwheelbutton grouping is also just a little too tight for my rather large hand
but i am slowly getting used to it and so far it has functioned flawlesslyit is a good product but i am not used to use this
sometimes it irritates me while selecting image from one screen corner to another
it skips in between and then i need to reselectfor simple clicks and scrolls i dint face any issue but selecting a big portion of screen or image is paini like the logitech trackball mice because my wrist become tired with a traditional mouse
if you suffer with sore and tired wrist make the switch to a trackball mouse
this particular model use your thumb for navigation something a little ackward for meabsolutely nothing to complain aboout
now have  trackballs
use one for laptop
it would be nice if they made a smaller version for road warriors to take with their laptops
otherwise beautifully functional producti saw a trackball mouse on the desk of an acquintance and asked him what he thought
he raved about it so i thought id give this one a try
i use a large monitor  set at high resolution and i thought this might alleviate having to constantly pick up and reposition my mouse when working on large formats or magnified objects
i also hate constantly changing the batteries in a wireless mouse
so i chose this one
it works fine in most applications ie word documents spreadsheets email etc
 but i personally have a tendency to cause the ball to move slightly when i lift up my thumb and this can be frustrating when working on something that requires precision
ive had this a few weeks now and i am getting better at it
it just takes a while to change habits
also i dont know that i would really call this ergonomic
while im not using my wrist as much all the the movement is now done by my thumb and now it gets sore after a long day on the computeri used to absolutely love this mouse
i still use it
every day
constantly
i also have to clean it out
every dayliterally all that is stopping me from replacing it is remembering to actually go out and buy a new one
i think i need to stamp the words buy new mouse on my foreheadit is asinine to buy one of these now
unless you know youre ridiculously nostalgictechnically im sure this is a fine product
my college professor suggested using a trackball instead of a mouse for photoshop work but after ordering this and trying it out for awhile i went back to the mouse
this was too clunky and big for my smaller hand and i was very uncomfortable using itive been using the microsoft trackball mouse for years and loved it  unfortunately that mouse stopped working so i had to get a new onei like this mouse but it is a lot smaller than the ms mouse was
i suppose i just need to get used to this
also the ball itself doesnt move very smoothly the mouse pointer on the screen is fineallinall i like this mouse and its worth the money
however you do get what you pay forlet me give you some background before you read my reviewim in my s
i use computer  hours a day and start developing rsi symptomsi have tried  owned the following trackballslogitech trackman marble fx trackballlogitech optical marble mouselogitech trackman wheel opticallogitech cordless optical trackmanoriginal  buttons kensington expert mousekensington expert mouse prothe logitech trackman wheel optical does not score well in my needs  eliminating  reducing my rsi related painspros reasonably priced good build quality scroll wheel included programmable buttonscons cannot be used left handed small trackballthis is one of the few trackballs that has a useable scroll wheel
the logitech cordless optical trackman and the kensington expert mouse pro for example has a tiny scroll wheel that you wont even bother to use after a period of time
this one however is positioned like all the other mice and you can use your middle finger to scroll effortlesslyhowever the biggest problem for me is that the trackball is controlled by the thumb instead of indexmiddle fingers like the other models
precise movement is harder to control using the thumb
also you can move from point a to point b much faster by using the index fingerconsider this experiment point your mouse pointer to the bottom right of the screen which you can conduct in any local electronic store before you decide to buy this product and then try to move the pointer to the upper left corner
take note of how much effort it requires and how much stress it is putting on your thumb rather than how long it takes for you to complete this task for those who own a  lcd you should record your time and post it here
now you should understand why using the thumb to control the trackball is a bad ideaif your local electronic store has the kensington expert mouse on display you can compare how superior it is to use a huge trackball with your indexmiddle fingerfirst im not used to using a trackball  thus perhaps my own problem
but i suspect that others may have the same problem of adjusting to this input method
one complaint though the scroll wheel is extremely slow  by that i mean that it takes a lot of turning to move the screen down or up
this speed may be adjustable but i dont see any way to adjust
overall not bad but it may take me a little longer to become proficient with it  have only had it for one weekok its a basic pci gigabit ethernet card
probably not one you want to buy however since linksys says they may never provide windows  drivershowever it is possible to get this card working fine in windows  if you have a version  form of the card the currently shipping versionyou can find the required download by googling for realtek and sid which should find you realteks windows  driver installer dated 
you install this which will say it doesnt find any matching hardware then in device manager update the driver for the unrecognized network adapter use the option to browse from a list of drivers select network adapter realtek and pci gbe as the card and tell it to install anywaythis has made the card work fine in windows  retail version for mehope this is of help to someonegthis product works great on my pcs with xp and win vista but as soon as i upgraded to win   bit it became a doorstop
no support as of yet for win  from linksysif your looking for any other os this is a great card but if you plan on win  look elsewhere
real shameupdate just wanted to update everyone that i have spoken with linksys support and they told me that their not sure win  drivers will ever be created for this product
shame because i just purchased it about a month ago
linksys used to be so good about supporting their productsim upgrading my home network to gigabit wired n wireless
i have a linksys n as the routerswitch a netgear gs as a local switch to connect an older pc and a work laptop with a gigabit ethernet port
i installed this card eg in the older pc and installed the driver
going forward i had much slower boot times and the cpu pegged at  all of the time
yes i did have network connectivity but the pc was almost impossible to use
i put the old etherfast card back in and the pc went back to normali want to emphasize that that the old pc is slow p but is fully up to date with xp pro sp
my guess is that this card puts one hell of a load on the cpu that just isnt noticed on faster processors
it may well be fine for newer desktops that due to cheapskate manufacturers still come with etherfast connectionsmy computer doesnt recognize this at all connected to my video camerai dont know if the cable is malfunctioning or i need software for an older computerill keep working on itit was given as a gift to my boyfriend he wanted it and needed it
it arrived promplyi suspect im not the only person who has gone through so much gadgetry requiring so many assorted connectors that its frequently less timeconsuming and irritating to simply purchase the required connector than sort through the boxes and drawers of accumulated stock
enough is enough
i can remember when the large phone plug would suffice to connect just about anything then it was the rca plug and now its a galaxy of plugs and connectorsguaranteed to occupy a computer userphotographeraudiophilevideophileand musician those electric keyboards and little midi boxes
for several lifetimesthis cord i must have  somewhere in the house by now will nicely transport your photos from your digital camera to your computer via firewire connectivity
but the micro pin connector is perpetual impending disaster
its convenient for the canon elphs and other small cameras that barely make a bulge in your shirt pocket but its increasing use by manufacturersfor example in  gb external storage drives used to store the precious records of a lifetimeis inexcusable
ive had them wilt on me fall loose from their female harbor fail to reach a coy recessed receptacle and experienced close calls too numerous to mention
aside from the briefest of usesa quick transfer of files from a mini portable camera or mp player to your computerthe  pin should be outlawed
look for equipment that doesnt require it remember when floppy disc drives came with the cable permanently attachedive had mixed results with these memorex cdrw discs having used them on both windows nt and windows xp pcs
the discs oftentimes work fine but more times than i would have liked ive started to add files to an existing disc only to discover that the disc has become unreadable for some reason
this happens even when i use the discs on one pc alone it happens much more frequently when i go back and forth between computers
i do back up some of my important files on these discs but i would never depend on them as my sole means for recovering files lost in a pc crash
im sure memorex cdrws such as this are quite common among workplaces as they are relatively inexpensive and widely disseminated
for basic wordwordperfect and spreadsheet files they are ok for the most part
i wouldnt trust these things for graphics or other large files however and i certainly would not trust them with really precious files
and whatever you do make multiple backups of your important files or if at all possible make use of more than one backup devicethese are cdrw discs of course so they are made to order for saving text files spreadsheets and the like if you want to save music files youll want to use cdr discs cdrws wont play in standard cd players and only cdrw allows you to reinsert the disc and add files at any time until the disc gets full of course  it holds  mbmemorex however is not recommended by drive manufacturers and i have created many coasters  will be ordering another brand not worth a return hasslethese seem to burn fine but i do have some trouble playing them  in certain cd players
maybe its the playerthese cds worked okay in my plextor pxal but i had about  coasters out of the batch
this may be because acoustica mp cd burner software is fing up all the time lately so i cant totally fault the discs but these are not the taiyo yuden versions
these ones are made in taiwan not japan
if you want the really good ones that never f up on you make sure you get the taiyo yuden versions not these
an average disci received these discs quickly but was disappointed to see that they are from taiwan not japan
packaging is totally different than pictured gold label not bluebut this could just be an update
the label says maximum performance and archival quality which is what i want for photos
i havent used them yet so will submit another review of the quality laterthis would be a  star item except for two major problemsthe first is that the router only functions via the uplink port
and that port is only mb
if you already have an existing network that is mb youll need to buy a  switch to plug this in
irony is i bought this because it includes its own switch
this mb port is a major bummer
a single wireless laptop is mb
if you have two or three or 
they all have to share that mb uplink
if you want to connect mb wired devices to the switch portion of this device they share that mb too
choke chokethe other killer with the uplink port is that it cannot be a bridge to your dslcable modem or other hub
the uplink port is a router or it is nothing
if you have multiple ip addresses from your isp the mr will not function as a bridge for those other ip addressesif your needs are simple the mr is a great device
you get a single address from your isp and it will mac masquerade for cable modem users and you plug in the mr
plug everything else in and you dont even need to configure the mr it just works
however and why i killed two stars in my review if you have an existing network or want to build your network out later the mr integrates very poorlyi have this router and b rocks but ive had trouble using it with my charter my isp cable modem
when charter resets its gateway which is something very common in the isp industry i guess the router has to be completly reset to factory defaults in order to quotregainquot a connection to the internet
this in itself would only drop the rating to a  of  but netgears backup settings utility seems to back up the old gateway address too so even after resetting the router to factory defaults and then reinstalling your backed up settings you arent on the internet
you still need to completely reconifgure the router from scratch by hand can be very frustrating depending on the amount of conifguration you want your local intranet to havetheres no need to buy the brand name version of this
a few million factories in china are pumping out exact copies and its a simple piece of molded plastic thats kind of hard to get wrong
you can find the knockoffs around for  and theyre just as solid
try auction sites if amazon doesnt have any of the aftermarket onesits a piece of plastic that says nikon on it and fits the back of a nikon lens
the best part is  it doesnt say canon on it
hayou can get a thirdparty one on ebay for one dollar
theres nothing better about one made by nikontheres really no reason to buy brand name with this
get on some auction site or otherwise search around and you can get a set of rear lens cap  body cap for like  or something
youre going to want another body cap anyway
seriously its just a molded piece of plastic
any factory in china can make one of these and not surprisingly several arethis is a nice wireless mouse but i would suggest buying one of the newer wireless mice that microsoft makes
while this mouse does the job i feel that the newer mice just fit better ergonomically in ones hand and its a more pleasant experience
i dont find the new horizontal tilt wheel technology in the new mice particularly useful but its another upgrade over this old style mouse
 recommendedi feel pretty lucky compared to other people who reviewed this mouse
i like it a lot except for one or two minor problemsthis mouse feels much better in my hand than any other mouse i have tried so far
and i like the feel of the wheel alsoso far i have not had to replace the batteries but it has only been one weekmy main complaint is that sometimes you spin the mouse wheel and the screen does not move
i have two of these mice and the both do it on two separate pcs
so it is definitely a design issue with these micei find that to be very annoying
but if you can get past that it is a nice mouseapparently this camera receives lots of user compliments  but browse it carefully you will find that a great percentage of these positive comments are from first time digital camera buyers or users
i wonder whether their opinions will hold true after they have tried other digital cameras on the market
the truth is that there are better choices out there even at similar pricesfirst lets look at a myth floating around among first time digital camera buyers mega pixel is everythingsince a mp camera delivers a higher resolution than a mp camera the picture it takes should be sharper
sounds right
not necessarily so
the quality of the output mainly depends on the quality of the lens and grains
a grainy mp photo taken with a lower quality lens is not necessarily better sharper than a low noise mp photo taken with a high quality lens
it happens that the photo taken with dx contains lots of noise and the  element in  group lens might not be as sharp as lens on digital cameras from other vendors in the same classok now lets talk about the cameradesign and builtdx is very compact
it has a slim plastic body and is suprisingly light even with two aa batteries inserted
it has a sliding door style lens cover and you can only find a few buttons on the camera
everything is designed for simplicityhowever this design also brings out the issue of quality of construction
the battery door hatch and compact flash door hatch are extremely fragile
the first time i accidently dropped my dx it broke the battery hatch door and the bottom of the case became cracked
kodak initially asked  for fixing the battery door saying this is a flat fee
after my complaint about the high cost of fixing kodak suddenly said somehow they calculated it wrong and i was charged  instead
i have to admit that their service is pretty fast though
two days after the phone call i got the fixed camera back
the lcd is only  inch and it is not bright so you might have some problem reading it under bright sunlight
however i like the lcd menu very much it is so easy to operate even a monkey can find all the options and settings and make the adjustmentbecause i like high contrast photo and saturated color i always prefer kodak color
the dx does take photo with good color
but when i start to compare these with pictures i took with kodak dc and dc a while ago i was hugely disappointedthe color of the photos taken with dx looked very plain and dull
and then comes the worst part the photos also have more noise than those taken with dc and dcsdc and dc are old generation mp kodak digital cameras
dx is a mp digital camera of a new generation
but everyone who has seen my photos can tell that the mp photos i took with the dc and dc are better than those taken with dx
i dont know what kodak has done to the dx series they did fix the dc and dcslow shtter speed problem but they failed to produce a camera that could take better pictures than their old geneation of cameras
and the build quality of kodak dx series is definately inferior to those like a brick feeling dc and dcs
i think this is really saddo i have anything to recommend with even lower price tag than the dx
sure canon a and fuji z
they are both mp and i think they can compete well with dxsome suggestion for first time digital camera buyers try and compare several digital camers before you make the final decision
what others are saying might not make sense to you
try compare and make decision for yourselfnowdays it is outdated  even hddvd is dead now    it cannot do upscaling so not good for large tv setsthe choices in mp players are simple solid state cd or hard disk
before i bought the archos jukebox i though the cd format is best for me
however after purchasing the archos g jukebox player i know that the hd is the best way to go
there just isnt any substitute for having your entire music collection with you all the timehaving said that i decided to return the jukebox player
why
because i decided that i want its big brother the archos jukebox recorder
the archos jukebox player was so good that it convenienced me that the hd is the format i want and therefore i dont mind spending the extra price or so for the recorder
for the extra price you get the following in the order of importance to me higher resolution display
the player can display only one line of text the name of the song while you are browsing the song list and while the song is playing
this limits your capability to quickly move through the list
the recorders higher resolution lcd screen can display about  lines of text and lots more information about the mp file youre playing
recording capability  you can generate mp files by directly hooking up an audio source to the recorder
however the limitation is that it only records in vbr variable bit rate and the sound quality if you hook up analog just isnt going to be as good as digital copies
user interface and buttons
the recorder has  more buttons  vs  which makes the user interface a lot more intuitive
gone is the twokey combination for volume control of the player as well as other strange key combinations
usb  interface  if you have a usb  interface on one of your computers youll be able to access the recorder drive which is usb  compatible at mbps instead of mbps in the case of the player usb 
the difference in speed is nightanddayeither way with the player or the recorder make sure you evaluate an open source firmware rockbox
believe it or not it actually improves the sound quality over the original archos firmwarethe battery cover on the archos is notorious for difficult to open
here is a tip  use the cap of a bic pen and insert the pointy protrusion slanted side out into the battery hole on either side of the lcd screen
this will slide the cover out slightly then pull the battery cover up and out
batteries on any electronic device should be much easier to get to but with the bic cap technique you can remove the batteries in  seconds flatnote the player  is the playonly model while the recorder is the model that also records if you have young eyeballs this smaller screen with smaller fonts might be just fine
but if you are over  i suggest you go with a fullsized palm screen or a larger handspring display
i liked the ms convenient flipscreen much better than handspring visors and the m would have fit the hand very comfortably
but that new expansion card creates a sharp uncomfortable edge in the otherwise smooth glovelike fitalso my m screen was defective left side would not respond to stylus so i sent it back and bought a palm vx insteadi dont find any pda screen big enough for multimedia web browsing nor even email
so i dont think color is worth paying for and theres no need for quotexpandibilityquot if you choose a monochrome pda with  mb of memory
also i find serial port better than usb for synchronizing a monochrome pda because it is plenty fast for plain text and leaves one more usb port available on your computer for devices that really need itso the palm vx was a better choice for me  more than the m but  less than the m
your quotmileagequot may varyi have returned this product for the following reasons the screen although sharp is actually smaller than the palm vx iiixe etc
this reduction in size leads to a reduction in the ability to enlarge fonts of about one magnitude
since i already was at the largest font on my iiixe this was a step backward
the flip rubber cover although a nice idea came totally scratched
investigation with palm revealed that you cannot purchase a replacement cover
the product i received was actually a returnedrepackaged item
the unit came with two aaa batteries already installed plus the two in the package
while the unit does allow for expansion via memory cards there are currently no applications that can actually take advantage of this extra address spaceanother disappointing effort from palmthey took the m which is plagued mainly by its small screen and decided that what people really wanted was expandability
so they ramp up the price add a couple of expansion slots throw in a faster processor a usb cradle and a couple of software extras and voila
the mif you want the cheapest palmbranded model with expansion capabilities then the m is itbut what palm should have done imho is lowered the price of the m and given the masses what they they were demanding with the m  a larger screen
i cant emphasize that enough
with a monochrome screen to begin with and the builtin difficulty of pointing and clicking on a palm device size matters
id recommend buying a visor deluxe or the new neo in this price range
not only are they a good bit cheaper they have a larger screen as well as expandability
if you want to stay with palm consider the palm v although lacking in expansion slots it comes in a superslim package with a rechargeable lithium battery and a fullsize screeni also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy expandable new m but in that price range i think a pocketpc might make more sense
heres a basic product guidepalm mhandspring visor  bargain basement models with  mb of ram
good starter models for the price
distinguishing characteristics visor has significantly larger screenexpansion slot and fast usb cradle
palm has slower serialpalm mvisor deluxe  workhorse models with  mb of ram plenty for monochrome models
visor has bigger screenusbexpansion slotpalm mvisor platinum  upper middle class models
visor platinum has larger screen

smallest fullfunction pda with lithium rechargeable batteryvisor edgepalm visor pro  all way too much for a palm
consider compaq ipaq instead which although bulky has a wonderfully brilliant screen and can double as a digital audio machinebravo for the clean images of the  megapixel setup but take one star away for the lack of a true optical zoom and another for making the camera compatible with multimediacard memory format harder to find costlier smaller max memory size than cf and there you have it a  star pkggamers
dont buy flat screen monitors
if you think that the clarity of the picture is good that is true but there is a terrible outcome of getting a flat panel monitor
dont expect to get good picture if you even do without having the game crash if you want to raise the resolution
on a flat panel it is has godlike clarity but you can not raise the resolution in games
you can raise the resolution on your desktop but not in games
i did not know this until a kid that went to my computer camp last summer experienced this problem in quake  and then unreal tournament and then serrious sam
so gamers i am warning you
do not make the same mistake that this kid made and dont get any flat panel monitor
the people that will love this monitor are people that need it for their office at work or home for space saving reasons and multimedia nerds that watch lots of movies dvds divx etc
graphics designers will also love this monitor but all graphics designers know that they should have either a flat panel monitor or a  inch crt monitor
once again gamers dont get flat panels
everyone else this is an excelent affordable space saving flat panel monitor and it has godlike picture clarity
everyone besides gamers that are in the flat panel market right now should buy this monitor
dont walk but run
run like the wind to your nearest retailer and buy this monitornormally i swear by refurbs but i have to secondguess that notion after buying this camera
physically it is in perfect condotion and all pieces are there
those two points led me to believe that the camera was perfectwell the first thing that bothered me was that none of the automatic exposure modes auto portrait landscape etc
work
not sure why and i have read the manual twice to ensure that i was not overlooking some obvious button to enable these modesanother issue and im not sure if its a bug or a feature is that the lcd stays on while film is loadedeven when the camera is quotpowered offquot
the camera constantly shows the exposures remaining and the quotfilm loadedquot indicator stays on
i guess since lcd watches last for years on one battery then this shouldnt be a serious battery drain
it is good to know before you pull it out to use and potentially ruin good film
maybe its a featurenow for the good points flawless pictures
i am using the camera for a intermediate photography class which is why i didnt return it and it takes perfect exposures
so far i have done night photos multiple exposures camera will handle  action shots and family pictures all with flawless resultsgranted the great pictures are due to the photographer but the clarity and sharpness are really impressive
the user interface takes some getting used to but it actually seems intuitive once you learn the camera
it seems that aperature and shutter could be adjusted easier thoughminus two because of the first two points
id imagine if i had bought it new it would be an easy  for a photo hobbyist like myselfi missed out on all the recent discounts to the visor deluxe in my area but really wanted to get a pda
as far as the palmos goes i loved the features avantgo outlook integration ebooks
however the hardware leaves much to be desired the glossy plastic holds fingerprints like glue and is very slippery the battery was down  after  days many syncs the backlight is weaki bought my first portable mp player almost two years ago
it was a diamond rio
it was by far the best player that i ever had
i have owned three other since then since these players are pretty fragile
none of them have been as good
isnt technology supposed to make things better and not worsesince then i have been struggling to find a good player so i decided to try out the intel personal audio player  it gets the job done but it was certainly not designed with the jogger like me in mind
the belt clip is weak
there is no battery juice bar to alert you when the battery is about to die mp players used to have that
like i said  isnt technology supposed to make things better
transfer speed to the player is relatively slow
the buttons arent really placed in a userfriendly manner
there is no separate power off button
in order to turn the thing off you have to press the stop button and hold it down for a few seconds who came up with that bright idea
the one improvement that i like is in the transfer software
you can transfer songs and peruse your song list at the same time unlike previous versions of the transfer software
still i am not overwhelmed with this player
if you have never owned one before then this version might impress you but if you have been playing with these things for a couple of years then it definitely wontthis is my second mp player
frankly i dont see why anyone need more than one but i only got it because my first one which is a samsung wasnt any good  for one thing it was using up my batteries while the darn thing was off
i am sure they made alot of fixes but definitely read the reviews before you buy a samsung mp player
as for my intel player its the best
very reliable
havent had any problems with it
very easy to use
comes with nice software
sound is great but i think the sound on the samsung was better
there are some minor things which are matters of personal taste
the back of the player is soft and rubbery like one of those softgrip pens
i hate that feeling
personally i like the hard cold metallic feel of your everyday electronics
you have to press the buttons really hard for it to work
this is done on purpose so you wont accidentally hit the buttons when you put it in your pocket although there is a buttonlock
also the display is not lighted and does not show the title of the song
but the thing i found most annoying about this player is that its damn ugly
very ugly to be exact
i cant bare to look at it
it claims you can customize the face
i tried but worstjust when you think it cant get any uglier by putting in one of their selection of faces or your own creation you actually made it the ugliest mp player known to mankind
im not even kidding
i am a professional artist and there is nothing i can do to make it look better
i just left the face blank
the only reason why i am still using it is because it is very reliable and its not a battery hog
and lastly the headphones are terrible
but from what i read in the reviews all the mp players come with inferior headphones
you start wondering whether they worked out some deal with the headphone manufacturers to increase profit for everyone
with the headphones this player gives you not only is the sound bad but the plugs are so big that you start to experience pain after a few minutes of listening
could you imagine that
you are enjoying easylistening music and your ears start hurting
ironic
but my grandmaster once said dont worry about the pain it will go away  so you can heed his advice or just use better headphoneswith windows me but not at all with windows xp
a search of the manufacturers website uncovered no new driver eitherthese are low cost low performance speakers
they are fine for an office or low use areai consider myself a digital camera novice
here is my review for what it is worthto get a good picture you have to hold the camera completely still or you get a blurry picture
this is almost impossible to do since the process of pressing the button makes the camera move
i think this is happens since the camera only has an iso of   most cameras in this price range only have  as well
assuming you can hold it still it does take a nice picturethe back screen is hard to see in any conditions even when adjusting brightness
when you view the picture after taking it you dont know if it is a good one or bad onthe part to open the battery is on the bottom usually where your thumb is and i find that it pops open if you arent careful with handlingwhile i think the finepix  is a very nice camera for beginners having used other cameras there are a few gotchas in my opinion
the lcd screen is quite dark even in regular room lighting
the optical viewfinder is a lifesaver here
i have also found that the white balance in shots taken under florescent lights can be less than perfect
it also bothers me you cant view photos on the lcd unless the lens cover is openthe pictures are good  but i found i was tweaking every one by adjusting the brightness and contrast
my previous camera olympus dl never required this
ok i am picky
i admit it
in addition using the zoom allows you to be further from your subject but remember the flash may not be able to cover that distance
this isnt specific to the  but keep it in mind
based on the average review ive seen here this is one hot camera
i dont want to dampen things but if you are expecting a bit more from this camera like i was you might be disappointedi would suggest you also check out the olympus dz camera also available from amazonhad to get a soundcard for my new computer cause i didnt want to use the built in sound
i bought the audigy because it was the newest thing out and was being touted as the best thing for audio since stereo soundwhen i installed it though the sound thru my  boston accoustics speakers was a joke
i had to turn them way up to hear anything at all
the sound was hissy and crackly
after i moved the speakers away from the monitor the sound improved greatly but i still have to have my systems volume turned up all the way to hear anything
i definetely expected more but maybe if i got more expensive speakers i might unlock the potential of this soundcardthe package comes with  shelves but you only really use  shelves to hold  dvdbluray cases  per shelf
the good thing is that i only needed  good shelves for my configuration
the bad is that  of the shelves were somewhat defective out of the package parts of the shelves were slightly warped or poorly welded in comparison to some of the other shelves in the package
the paint job on the rack had noticeable scratchesimperfections if you look up close
it was fairly easy to construct
the rack seems fairly stable and functional to hold about  cases per level
i have the rack leaning slightly against a wall to add some stability to prevent from falling over since i didnt want to screw it to the wall
the price is a little steep for the quality of the rack that you get i had higher expectations for the build quality but am mostly satisfied for its utilityi purchased my first tier rack in  assembly was easy going
product was in excellent manufacturing condition
but as time passed i ran out of room for dvds
i recently ordered an additional one
this second one was not as easy to assemble
every shelf needed to be hammered down at the edges to prevent them from popping out of the plastic stoppers i used a rubberhead hammer
the interior threads of one of the rods were either stripped or semiunfinished because when i screwed one halfrod into the other half the two pieces would not stay sealed tight
i had to use loctite glue to hold them together
also four of the eight shelves were slightly bowed in the middle but it wasnt very noticeable once dvds filled them
something definitely happened at the factory in china between the first time i bought this media rack in  and my recent purchase of another
finally there is just no way that this rack can hold the amount of cds dvds and vhs tapes that atlantic claims it can
its just not tall enough
i no longer have vhs tapes and my first rack was a combination of cds and dvds  and one shelf went to waste because it could only hold cds or dvds if laid on their sides
the new one is only for dvds and it too was left with one shelf that cannot accommodate dvds uprighti set mine up for dvds and used  of the  shelves
after assembly i noticed that the back stop on two of the shelves was wobbly and would not reliably hold dvds
these were on the lower levels and it was too much trouble to take it apart
ill prop them up somehow when i load those shelvesabout a third of the dividers are so badly made that they will not stay in placeits a bit wobbly and i have used the straps to hold it to the wall
so far there have been no problems with the shelf and two big dogs in a narrow hallway
im getting another one for cds
ive mailed the factory so maybe ill have some extra parts to insure i have enough good parts feb  got the second one and it had fewer bad dividers
the back stops looked good to start with but upon assembly a couple got flexible
it doesnt take much to mess them upi never heard from the factory about the bad parts so i took away  starlike most bookshelvesdvd cases you buy this thing will have an extra shelf once you finish assembling it
i set mine up to be dvd height which gave me the extra shelf i ended up tossing in the trashassembling the thing took less than  minutes and needs no tools
you just need to be able to tell which way is upi have standard carpet and put it against the wall
my carpet is tucked underneath some floor boards so at the very edge before the wall it slopes down to get under the floor boards
i never even noticed this until i put this shelf against the wall
the back to legs hit this slope and it wobbles a little on the carpet
it does come with an earthquake strap but its a hideous white thick shoulder strap
ill be getting a black one over the weekend
and something a little less of an eye soreworks but you need to modify the bottom to make every shelf the same size to fit  shelves with dvdsyup these headphones are cheap
yup these headphones are better than what came with your ipod or other portable music device
but then again that bar is really low the headphones they toss in the box with most portable music devices are trashgiven the current sale for less than  you can buy these headphones and get an appreciable upgrade in sound qualitythat said these are far from the best low cost portable headphones on the market
theres probably nothing better sounding for less money but if youre willing to spend a few dollars more any of the low end koss headphones are much superior sounding to theseits not even a competition
the difference the koss headphones are more accurate the high end of the koss headphones is less fatiguing and the bass of the koss headphones is tighterok now for specificssticking to  or under id recommend the following koss headphones all available at amazon or at other fine retailers
 the koss kcs behind the ear model similar to these philips hss not much more expensive than the philips headphones and so much better sounding the koss ktxpro the koss portapro ugly but good sounding or the koss sportaproif you simply cannot spend another penny beyond what these hss cost well then buy them and at least youll be getting an improvement on the junk they tossed into the box with your portable player before they shipped it
but if sound quality matters to you add about what it costs for one big mac to your purchase price and get a serious improvement in sound quality by getting the kossi bought these hoping i could wear them with my giro helmet when skiing
as it turns out they are much too bulky for this
sennheiser phones worked great the philips phones might work with a really short helmet but not a giro which is actually a shortystyle helmet itself
these headphones have very good sound great for the price but i found them uncomfortable even without the helmet
the headband has a groove in its underside for the cord
the edges of this groove are sharp and after a while they really dug into the tops of my ears
ouchgreat headphones and are more comfortable then the annoying earbuds
however the cord was a little short so i had to use an extension cablei got the  version and love the newer version
i originally ordered the  based on other rave reviews but the non amazon merchant shipped me the  instead which i promptly returned
the  has a cloth cover and is very comfortable for many hours of usage
i love shopping at amazon bc it has better price than other stores good return policy on  wrong item or wrong buy and free shippingi would only buy this camera if its on sale for well below the suggested price and if it is significantly cheaper than other x megapixel cameras
i picked this camera up for a very good price at an early morning post thanksgiving sale yet i barely got what i payed for
had i paid full price i would have taken it back that daythe main problem with this camera is that it only delivers quality images if you have lots of light but no backlighting
otherwise those  megapixels yield x images that are very graining andor blurry
there also seems to be slight to moderate color distortion on many images though this can be adjusted using the bundled softwarelike most digital cameras it eats batteries
if you turn off the lcd while taking pictures and just use the viewfinder that goes a long way to stretching battery life
however after taking a picture the lcd will sometimes stay on instead of showing the picture and then turning offanother concern i have about this camera is the durability
the camera feels very cheap
it has no lens cover and the battery door is very flimsy
also about a week after i purchased this camera the lcd stopped working
i turned it on and off several times and also tried fresh batteries with no luck
finally i gave it a gentle smack on the side and the lcd immediately turned on
i havent had this problem since but history tends to repeat itself especially with electronicsif youre thinking of purchasing this camera i would suggest going to an electronics store and compare this camera to others
i think you will find the others produce better imagesas mentioned your reception will be dependent on the antenna you use
a few notes youll need an adapter to connect a standard antenna to this unit there are no weather stations despite what other reviews say verified with midland there is no channel scan function
so youll have to tune into a channel and hope that youre on the right one
you cant monitor both  and  for exampleit seems to receive well but it lacks in transmission even at short distances
i ordered a stronger antenna and i hope it helps
it is very compact and appears to be made welli bought this radio as a backup for communications in case of an emergency
the quality of the unit is very good and the reception is good
i gave it a rating of  because i have not been able yet to receive a call back when transmitting a request for a radio check so dont know if it is getting out there
there are many reasons you may not get a reply to a radio check weather range no one listening at the time etc
it comes with a v cigarette lightertype cord for charging batteries but requires  aa batteries to operate it
i have seen v cartype  channel cb radios for half the price that may be a better choice at home if you have v power and a portable antenna available at homecheap and seems to work
it is very simple but heavy
i really wonder why the rechargers cost so muchthis is a great camera with wonderful features
butthe redeye reduction system does not work
instead of flashing twice as most cameras do the g projects a quotbrightquot beam a light while you focus on your subject
this beam is not bright enough to constrict the pupils in the first place and is not wide enough to even hit the pupils in a typical composition
you have to attempt to flash the beam in the subjects eyes before taking the picturevery difficult to impossiblefor this price and considering all of the advanced features i would expect better
i cannot recommend this camera because of this egregious flawcanon g owners please complain to canon if this bothers youmaybe it could be fixed with a software upgradethe canon g gives amazing color
get a good canon printer like the i and youll get amazing prints
it does black and white very well and gives great bright colors in landscape photos
my only real complaint is its super slow
i upgraded from the toshiba m  megapixel camera and i honestly wish that id kept it too
the toshiba while three years older than the canon caught better candid shots
i find that when using my canon i cannot capture good candids of people or animals its so slow that the subject moves before it records the scene
super slow
it hesitates all of the time and the red eye flash alerts your subject that you are there totally ruining the picture
im either looking at buying a canon d or buying back my old m for nowthis was a good camera at the time i bought it which was about two years ago
now i realize that i need to buy a new one
the camera itself takes moderately good pictures but thats about the only positive side to it
when you want to look at the pictures youve taken on the screen its a huge battery waster
my biggest pet peeve is the time it takes to reload after taking a picture
its an ok camera if you just want to try one out but its no good if youre an avid photo takerive had this camera for a couple years now and im still quite pleased with it
at its prime it was one of the smallest cameras around
however that size does come with a price
ie lack of features
there is no zoomonly x digital and can only be used in vga mode fixed focus and very few manual settings
however the camera still is quite goodpictures are pretty good
if you have ample light they are wonderful
if its dim you get yellowish colors
this can usally be somewhat corrected with softwarethe one major problem ive had with mine is the selector swith is giving out
many times as im composing a shot itll flip back to preview mode
people might also have problems finding cards now of days as it uses smart media cardsnot smart digitalall in all a great point and shoot camera
great if you dont have time to fiddle with focusing and suchwhile the photo quality is amazing on this camera there is one maddening thing about its operations that makes me secondguess purchasing it
there is about a one to two second delay between the time you press the button to take the photo and the moment the photo is actually capturedi took the camera on vacation and when other people offered to take my familys photoi had to explain to them not to move the camera for a couple seconds after pressing the button so that we all didnt come out in a blur
i am amazed that this has not been pointed out in camera reviews
i wish i had known this because it is a major flawthis camera is terrible at action shots on automatic
i havent tried it on advanced settings yet
i will have to explore that morealso it takes a long time for the camera to quotwarm upquot once you open the cover and prepare to take a photo
very little spontaneity is possible with this camera if you intend to put it away and take it out only during photo opportunitiesthe best use for this camera is for still shots and people portraits
its not a quotgetupandgoquot camera with fast response time and responsiveness
i am hoping that my inquiries into olympus will clear this up as a simple programming issue so that i can speed up the cameras performance
but as of now i feel the camera isnt as versatile as i would likethis is a camera similar to the c whose time has come and gone
it is old technology with a serious delay between shutter release and flash
it is very hard to take a low light picture without the person blinking due to the flash delayat only  mp and very heavybulky to hold and carry you can do much better with a more advanced newer model camera
the smart media cards the olympus requires are very expensive get a  mb but theyre never on sale anymore and fragile in contrast to the newer less expensive memory media available with other newer camerasbe aware that the second movie clip mode does not record sound
the camera does have many features but they are not intuitive nor user friendly and most people will just point and shootif you do buy this camera make sure you get a lens mount extender as you can damage the lensmotor if you accidentally turn on the camera with the lens cap on motor makes a grinding noisethis camera eats alkaline batteries so youll also need to get  nimh batteries and a fast charger
i recently sold my c on an auction site after i bought a  mp canon sd  from amazon
the canon is light years ahead of the olympus and amazon has an excellent price for it
you get what you pay forthese earbuds sound ok but there seems to be a slight buzzing when bass kicks in
i cant always notice it but its there
also the cushion that slips over the ear pieces has already ripped not that big of a deal and i expect it from  dollar ear buds
you get what you pay for if you want ear buds that will last for years go more expensivethese sound great killer base
however they dont fit my ears or anyone elses that has tried them
maybe if you have huge earsthe sound quality on these headphones is excellent but the size of the bud makes them uncomfortable to wear after a whileive had these for around  months and have subjected them to simple gym use
they finally stopped working on me today and i am not sure if sweat has finally taken its toll on these but they are no longer operational
for the price i am not dissatisfied but i would liked to have owned them for at least  months
i will still buy another pair seeing as how these are just for gym usage
quality is good i am no audiophile by any means but they dont blow me away
theyre about a midway point between cheap headphones and beats by dre headphonesthese earbuds provide decent sound quality but they dont fit well
they caused my ears to hurt after using for  minutesi have always been a sony fan
this product has not let me down
the sound that comes out of this earbud headphones is really good
the quality of the material is really good too
if you are looking for something cheap and goodthis is your producti love listening to audiobooks and since i purchase most of my books online and in mp format i use my little sansa clip player to listen to them as i do chores or putt around the house
regular old school headphones are much more comfortable than earbuds but they dont carry as much volume making me turn up the volume on my mp player to the max just to make out the dialogue so i decided to purchase a pair of earbuds
being a budget my eyes fell on theseflook im no sound expert and quite frankly when youre listening to audibooks bass really isnt a priorityso my scale isnt going to be what others measure quality by
id say the sound for these is average
nothing to write home about
they did the trick though and id have rated them at least one star higher if it wasnt for the comfort factor
these things hurt
not immediately but use them for about an hour and your ears start to throb around the cartilage areas that help nestle each bud to your earalso about two months into owning my pair i bent down to pick something up and received an unpleasant little shock at the side of my face
i took a look and found that the wire leading to the left bud had pulled away from the bud itself leaving the inner metal wiring exposed
my mp player doenst have enough charge in it for the shock to have really hurt but needless to say they were useless after that
into the trashbin they wentits ok nothing special
picks up a lot of noise not very distinct
i later bought a digital microphone 
costs a lot more but was well worth iti love the cordless capabilities of this set
the range is great the keys are quiet and the mouse is very accurate on the screen even in firstperson shooters for those gamers out there
however i wouldnt recommend this keyboard for the price  i believe for several reasons  the battery life in the mouse is terrible
my batteries need replaced once a month
the keyboard has been running fine on the batteries it came with for almost  months now
the letters on the keyboard are applied very cheaply
they will nearly wear off on the keys that you use the most
somehow one of the tabs that holds the palm rest to the keyboard broke
this isnt a big deal though the palm rest still stays on
minor detailmedia key doesnt work with the newest winamp version
i just programmed one of the logitech web site keys to open winamp who keeps these at the default anyway
like i want to use a logitech page as my search engine  pthe battery life is my main issue
it adds to the cost considerably i tried rechargeable nickel metal hydrides but they didnt seem to last as long as regular alkalines
other than that the keyboard is most likely a huge step up from whatever keyboard your computer came with
hot keys are very useful i even use the scroll wheel on the keyboard frequently
there are no lights on the keyboard to tell you if caps lock numberlock etc are on but it shows up in your task bar so its easy to keep track of thatother than the battery problems of the mouse the mouse itself is very nice and fits comfortably in your hand if you are right handed that isits a nice product if youre just interested in having a wireless mouse and keyboard and the itouch buttons on the keyboard work really wellthe problem is that sometimes when youre playing games the keyboard sends the keystroke signals in the wrong order
i know that sounds strange and it is
for example if i quickly type  ltentergt hello ltentergt sometimes the game responds as if the letter quotoquot was typed after you pressed enter
pressing quotoquot while in chat mode and pressing quotoquot while in gamingmovement mode can mean very different things
very annoyingalso the mouse just isnt that accurate
granted this could be because ive been using a razer boomslang mouse which is about as accurate as a surgical instrument so perhaps im hypersensitive
as a gamer i think the mouse just feelsnerfed
its fine for desktop and web application use but its just not smooth enough for a serious gameri dont want to say quotdont buy this productquot because its not a bad little setup
its great for someone who just uses the computer for internet and desktop applications
for the serious gamer however this cordless deal just doesnt cut it
im returning mine to the bestbuy where i got it and getting the corded versions of both productsi was very excited to get this keyboardmouse because i had great expectations after reading so many reviews online that were generally saying a musthave
now that ive had this keyboard for almost half a year i have alot of postitives and negatives
first im a serious computer user who sits and types and mouses around at least  hours a daypostitives came with  nonrechargeable batteries easy to set up coollooking factor quick access buttons especially the volume control and sidescroll keyboard batteries last a long time couple of months without a problem mouse scroll is smooth and quietnegatives batteries whether rechargeable or not in mouse lasts barely  weeks so you better have at least  new backup batteries or the mouse will just suddenly go dead mouse only takes v batteries most rechargeable batteries are v mouse sometimes disconnects or stops working and you have to shake it mouse form is not very ergonomic even for righthanders those indentations for your thumb and pinky are horrible mouse clicks are loud keyboard scroll doesnt work in frames both keyboardmouse customizations reset unless you load them in startup menu for windows keyboard clicks loud keyboard weight is overburdened by batteries in the front so having it in your lap tends to slip keyboard is hard to grip if you are carrying it since you may accidently press the poweroffsleep buttonoverall if i had known about how the mouse sucks up batteries power like a desert sucks up water then i wouldve just bought the keyboard alone
the optical mouse is definitely not for gamers who need accurate surfacing it is okay for photoshop
the keyboard is a good buy  but the problems with the mouse really devastates the whole cordless freedom packagei like the unit but you cannot transfer mp files from this unit to a computer
why
ask them
obviously its perfectly okay to transfer mp files  thats how you get them onto the nomad  but it will not transfer the mp files back out
this was a real bummer i had a lot of mp files on my work computer that i wanted to bring home
i put them on the nomad brought it home and then discovered in the fine print that it will not transfer mp files to the computer
rottenwhile the price savings at the time of this review is significant the quality is not up to par with the  really right stuff rrs dual axis level available only from really right stuff or the jobu design dualaxis clear bubble level with easy see green fluid both have much darker liquid and thicker lines allowing you to more easily see the bubble and determine if its actually level
additionally the plastic doesnt seem to be as dense thick or as strong as the really stuff or jobu
i have doubts how long itll lasti received this in place of a jobu that i ordered as it was out of stock at adorama
adorama has stated theyll refund the difference but i really wish they would have just backordered the jobu for mei have lots of lynksys gear and i have had lots more
lynksys stuff breaks dies and misbehaves regularly
it is however some of the most useful minimally proprietary and easiest to use consumergrade equipment out therei am on my third wmp on my server in  months but lynksys tech support is pretty good and they are prompt to send replacement hardwareeverything about the bad antenna placement is true
i have the computer in normal position the reception is 
if i turn it around with the antenna facing out the reception suddenly goes 
that is how much blockage a steel box can make
you might as well get the usb one instead if you havent buy it yetbut if you already did dont worry it works
but make sure you install it right
if you are using windows xp do not use the direct installation on cd
you want the system to detect it and search for driver in the disk
what happen is that if you install the driver first the software that come with the card and windows default wireless software will be competing for the card and the connection keep dropping after a few minutes
for other windows system you want to use the software because there are no wireless software build inafter hours of installtion and trying different placement
i finally decided to place my mail server insideout on the highest shelf of the kitchen which give me  signalfinally you might want to check one more thing before setting up a b network any ghz phones
i have a panasonic ghz phone and whenever i turn it on the network is immediately offline
i eventually disconnect the phone and use only a mhz onethe configuration utilities that ship with linksys wireless products will not installrun properly on winxp linksys requires you to use the winxp wireless zero configuration wzc service
one feature of wzc is that once every minute it will drop the current signal in search of a better one resulting in constant annoying interruptions to your online play
thus if you try to use linksys wireless products for online gaming prepare to be very annoyed
otherwise the card seems to work fine for normal web browsingi bought this card last december
opened my desktop pc installed the driver put the card in one of the pci slots had the desktop connected to the network in less than  minutes
then i spent the next  hours trying to get good reliable wireless connectionthe major complaint i have with the card is that the linksys should have separated the antenna from the card and allowed users to put the antenna somewhere else via a cable
with the antenna mounted on the back of the card directly it is completed shielded by the pcs metal case which makes the wireless transmission and reception poor
with all the cables and connectors in the back of a pc it also makes it hard to adjust the antenna at all i had to move the wireless card up and down the slots to find the optimal location
my wireless ap was only about  ft away and i was only getting    signal strength and link quality
from time to time it would lose the connection completely
linksys should really have thought through this antenna issue
after all the hard work and time spent i finally got the optimal antenna position
i am now getting    of signal strength and link quality
it now runs reliably at  mbps speedthe second problem i had was that this card interfered with my daughters favorite music player winamp
whenever she played music using wimapm the wireless card would lose connection and stop working completely
this problem was fixed after i downloaded the latest driver and firmware for the card
not sure if this is related to the creative sound card interference problem reported by another review
my desktop does have a creative sound cardi have owned the s s and s and have done everything one can do with these cameras
here is my take on the good and bad on the canon powershot sthis was a terrific small digital camera when it was introduced but the digital camera market advances quickly and this model has been surpassed by canons own s which is an updated s and the new s  megapixel in the same body only in hightech black
serious photographers seekng a digital should turn to canons eos digital rebel
the s and s are good cameras if you want lots of features in a small package without paying a lot of money
the two models are identical except for this the s is  megapixel and allows isoequivalence of  allowing for lowlight indoor photography
the s is a  megapixel model using a denser ccd and its maximum iso is   you can make the pictures smaller than the maximum size to conserve space on the removable compactflash cardsseveral modes are available to you such as sports high shutterspeed and high resolution shots portrait night etc
you can put it in complete idiot mode okay automatic mode and let it select your shutter speed and aperture or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one or you can go full into manual mode and pick both
theres even a movie mode complete with sound which creates video clips of  x  pixelsthis small camera fits in a purse or shirt pocket easily and wont get in the way if youre shouldering it in a case not included just buy a generic
but you pay a price for the small size the optical zoom is limited to x
and unfortuately the s like all the powershot s family starts out with a focal length of mm which is a very wideangle view
even at x optical zoom you will max out at mm often not as close as youd need
there is a digital zoom but so what
crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature
i found mm insufficient for shooting across a large room
if you work closer in this wont be a problem but it is not a good focal length for shooting children who stop whatever adorable thing theyre doing when they notice you framing that shot
and see comment on slow shutter response below
the sliding door that covers the lens and turns on the camera seems flimsy and can cause problems
my yo niece got ahold of my s remember this is the exact same body as the s and ripped the door off
i was able to reattach it but now its a loose tooth ready to fall off again
even under warranty my choice was to send it back to canon for  weeks or live with it
i couldnt live without the camera so i kept it loose sliding door and all
ive just learned not to lend it to people who cant baby it a good push and that door is off the camera againone of the ss most frustrating limitations is a slow shutter response
i cant tell you how many shots ive missed using it i frame it lovingly i see the perfect moment i shoot but no score
the people have moved on the sun has set the universe suffers heatdeath and finally the shutter clicks
if you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital slr as almost all the compactstyle digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue
another note of annoyance on the powershot s family they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap
i dont know what use a wrist strip is for a camera if im not using it then i want my hands free
i bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasnt a great fit
at least canon should offer one as an extracost accessoryi give this camera  stars  for putting so many features in such a small package but the loss of one because you can buy the s for about the same price and the gain of a megapixel more than makes up for losing iso  which produces very noisy photos anyway
the powershot s comes with software but youll probably want to buy your own image editing package such as photoshop elements
the package provided is fairly limited
useful software includes photostitch which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots
the included  mb compactflash card is also too small for typical use so plan on buying a bigger card
also plan on buying a second batterythis camera looks and works great and for a long time i had no issues with it whatsoever
the pictures were sharp and of decent high resolution
until i took this camera with me to las vegas to take some night pictures
it worked fine when taking closeup night shots with a flash but when taking long distance pictures it became practically useless
first distant images with flash enabled appear dark and blurry
if you disable the flash images come out nice and colorful
except they look like someone with parkinsons disease was holding the camera  the lights are smeared everywhere  even if you stand still as a statue
now i know what youre thinking  just decrease exposure time right
id love to do that if that was an available optionof the  pictures i took only  were useable and even then blurryby the time this camera is ready to shoot your subject is either long gone or scowling at you
just forget candids of the family unless youre lying in waitand wait you will
this is classified as a still camera but more accurate would be stilllife camera because thats about all its good for
from turn on to illumination of the red and green ready lights the delay can be around  seconds it seemsand another thing it gets the flash exposure wrong quite often and not just when light from the flash is bouncing off your finger into the sensoralso the histogram usually appears to be inaccuratein short it can take high quality pictures if you have the time to wait for it and then retake the picture
ironically its a little like using a x view camera
although the  is small its no zippy little joymemory is not a problem
just pop in a  gb ibm microdrive
batteries are not a problem either
just keep a spare in your pocket and youll go or wait all day
if you power it up in review mode or with the usb connected you dont need to remove the lens capwhen the coolpix   megapixels came out everyone was waiting for nikon to release a  mp prosumer digicam
here it is but it is lacking especially when compared to other digicams on amazon such as minolta dimage  excellent  mp camera
or olympus en another  mp gem but suffering from memory buffer issuessee the list of pros and cons to see why you should skip this coolpixpros  megapixels digital zoom x optical zoom x builtin flash no fumbling for popup buttons accepts compactflashtype i and type ii and ibm microdrive sharp nikon quality lens aperture range f  f superior macro abilities comes with rechargeable battery lightweight  lbscons bad red eye potential due to flash proximity to lens comes with a small memory card  mb
these days one needs at least  mb card for the large mp cameras limited lens potential
the mm equivalent lens    mm is good but almost guarantees youll need to buy an accessory lens to get telephoto capabilities ok battery life approx  min
 could be much better camera feels a little cheap due to its very light weightoverall the camera is good but not great
there are superior  mp cameras on amazon that deliver just as good or better pics and give the user much more creativity and control at easei recently ran into someone who owns one of these
the owner spent the next half hour telling me all the wonderful things this camera can do
the story ends up he is a freelance writer of some great repute and did not have to buy the camera nikon loaned it to him to test drivei freely admit the pictures it takes are stunning
i sure would love to be able to add additional lenses to my camera
but i have to ask myself if the coolpix  is worth the moneyfor me the answer is short and sweet no
my purpose in owning a digital camera is to take photos to send over the internet
i dont care how fast your connection is no one is going to want to download the huge files this camera generates
yes it is the right choice if you want to print you photos but at what it costs are you really going to take with you when your family goes to the local theme park and your kids love the soak zone or flume rides
no way im not sacrificing a kilobuck for a happy snap
if my current camera gets trashed yes ill be disappointed but i can afford to replace it
if i trashed a coolpix  id have a hard time replacing ityes its a great camera but ask yourself why did you decide to go digital
if its for fun pix the coolpix  may not be the ideal choice for you
if youre into digital photos for commercial use then maybe this is the camera for youim rating this middle of the road for its technical excellence at a very hefty price tagthis was a suitable case for an early model magellan gps
both are sitting on the shelf since new technology makes this of little interesti have only used this card for video capture not as a vcrthe software as of version  does not allow you to record with a horizontal resolution better than also on my windows xp machine the software crashes not infrequently and the drivers often make windows blue screen
you might want to consider compressing the videos you make using the divx codec
if you want to record with a horizontal resolution better than  like x dont forget to run a deinterlace filternow you have a perfectly serviceable video capture card for cheap
unfortunately i cant really say how good the quality is as all the stuff i have captured was rather poor quality to begin with but it seems decent enoughive had this for over a year now and used it very little for several reasons
first its big and bulky and very akward to carry
secondly it eats batteries when used for playing cds thirdly the radio reception is unacceptable
while the sound is very good and the antiskip feature works really really well i would not purchase this again because of the drawbacks and because its also quite costlyafter much comparison shopping i chose the rio volt for the following reasonsplays wma files alsodoesnt skipcomes with rechargable batteriesis reasonably easy to navigate once you learn howgives good info on its betterthanaverage lcd screenhas a useful remote and a nice skin casehas acceptable soundhas good controlsi was very pleased with this player for the first  weeks
then it just stopped working
i tried changing batteries running off the ac with no luck
so i sent it back and im now back to square  ive since read about other quick failuresid gladly pay top  for a really quality really well made mp cd player
sony makes a pretty one but it doesnt have the features that this one has
the sony also beeps when in pause mode aaaghproduct worked well for a year then just completely quit had to be replaced by an mp playeri have no complaints whatsoever with the playback and antiskip
it sat in the tape bin of my pickup for months and never skipped once
it delivered excellent playback even if the startup time is a little slowon the other hand one day it stopped working because a screw from the lid fell out and wouldnt stay in
it still worked but when it stopped working again and there was no loose screws pressing on  the cd this time i opened it up and discovered that every screwpoint standoff and bit of plastic inside the thing had broken
externally it looks perfect
internally its a wreck
very thin plastic in there where the screws are mated to thin plastic mount points
the very slightest misstep or in my case vibration from driving a vehicle with a suspension like a brick could seriously damage it by breaking standoffs and screwin points off from the inside of the case or shattering them around the screwsthat said a few hours and a tube of krazy glue and it works again
except i have to control it with the remote on the wire since the lid panel with the controls didnt have enough plastic bits left to glue to and make true contact with the buttonsall in all a fine piece of hardware so long as you treat it basically like its made of eggshell and never take it anywhere where it could conceivably be exposed to accidental abuse ie
treat it like a portable device because not everyone is as skilled with small tools and household adhesives as i am
at the price offered its not worth it
there are cheap mpcd players that you can beat up and not feel so sad aboutive had my  for about  months and i love most everything about it
but there are a few problems im having with the mp discs im making
if you burn a mp cd with more than  tracks think audiobooks at kbps and you create a playlist to make sure you hear it in order the player will stop after the th track
not a major problem ill admit but i drive crosscountry a lot and i was hoping to cut down my cd luggage when travelling
the other problem is when you fill a mb cdr any brandive tried  different and use a playlist the player will not even boot upit just goes back to the power on screen and stays there unless you go to the radio
the player has worked well other than these  probs sounds greatworks great with audio cds and the separate line out jack is great for plugging into my home stereo
ive heard customer support is in the toilet but until it stops working completely im coolhidont know how many of you purchased the riovolt as part of a free car kit deal but ive found the carkit causes my music to sound scratchy at times
yes its the kits fault because when i listen with headphones the defects are gonethe remote control is a bit sloppy and it takes some getting used to if youre trying to navigate menus with the remote
its much easier to do this with the buttons on the cd player itself but thats not always possible eg if youre drivingalso sometimes ive noticed it spins like crazy and hangs while trying to read my mp discs
its not like i burned them in any obscure way
in those cases i would have to turn the system off and turn it back on againbut otherwise a solid mp playeri bought this so i could use it in my car
to keep it short it did not live up to my expectationsprossweet screenidremote good ideagood sound qualityconsremote is too smallcheeply made plasticsound quality is good but not great your paying  dollars
the pros and the cons are about the same hence the  rating
i hope this helps in your descision makingthis antenna works decent for me because i live about  miles from my local hdtv transmitters
if it was any further i think this just wouldnt work
other thoughts  the bright blue led on the front is very distracting i had to cover it up with tape because it would light up the room at night bedroom and it was bad enough it would keep me awakei went through a couple of webcams before i got this one so i think i am qualified at least as an amateur user to comment on the pros and cons of the logitech quickcam pro the pros the installation was easyworked like a charm on the first try
thats a plus when working with any peripheral device and windows operating systems
the software that comes with the camera works well too
it allows you to capture edit and enhance a videoit is cutelooking
very sleek
it has a builtin microphone that works wellthe cons only medium to high light will give you good videos
low light is out of the question
before you say quotwell i am not doing any lowlight video workquot think about backlight
that is if you have a bright window the room may be too dark by contrast to get a decent image
the stand is poorly designed
it is hard to adjust the camera to just the right position
the long cable hanging from the back tends to drag the camera away from how you settled it
the stalk at the base of the camera that inserts into the stand is not easy to work withtends to twist from the position you set it
it is not ideal for netmeeting
this is because it is defaulted to zoomed mode which means you have to be further away from the cameragiving a fuzzier picture
the camera adjustments available in the logitech drivers are inexplicably not available within netmeeting including the zoom setting
what a pain that is
so for netmeeting i cannot recommend this particular cameraif you want to do online gabbing video back and forth with the
