not going to write a long review even thought this unit deserves one
ive driven well over mil miles and done most of my own routing so i pretty know whats the fastest and shortest
have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with any gps unit theyll all get you in trouble if you let them
i was really excited about this unit due to the size and the features
allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull
but the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking
i gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due
its like the prossesor that they installed in the tnd  was  years old
example if i needed to make a simple route change ie
in town down to the next street due to the fact that i couldnt make the turn or the street was blocked off it would take the tnd  upwards of  seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me
here im sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didnt make me happy
this is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change
also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up
at least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when i made a wrong turn it got it self lostie
take left on xyz street and it was some ones drive way
or turn left in  yards and the turn was less than  feet away
you might think in a conjested city situation i might get a little mixed up but this is out in the country
twice it put me under  bridges when im 
of course i made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be
i also updated the os versionvia rand mcnally
all in all i expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot
it just had to many route mistakes
going back to the basic garmin
this isnt just my complaints i have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints
all of us returned the unitsthe cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itselfthe price is completely unfair and only works with the nook hd and hdthe mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate
the holes dont align so i couldnt put two screws in
i just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment
then i used zip ties to secure the arm better
i did this because i had to install the tv asap and could not wait for a replacement
also the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom
this means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned
again i did a quick fix
i gave this  stars and not  because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount
i should not have to do quick fixes on a product like thisthe fact that the pivot point on this tv mount was not built straight caused the tv to tilt slightly when it was swung out
there is no adjustment for it so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall or when it was out
i do not recommend this wall mountto its benefit though it was reasonably sturdy and easy to installunfortunately im returning this mountthough i like the look of it particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts i feel that the one i ordered wasnt well madei purchased it to mount alg le inch p hz led lcd hdtvin our kitchenthe mount arrived quickly and was well packaged
unfortunately the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the lcd would never be levelalso the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and i could see some rust already formingi decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning figuring i would just get a replacement and hope for the best
im glad i did because this led me to find two other issuesthe first one i blame on the manufacturers the second i would consider a design flaw of the lg lcdthe first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short
the screws are only mm long and would barely catch in the threads of the tv if they werent recessed at all
most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed
i stopped by my local lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws m or something to that affect
 a packet so not much of an expenditure just a big hassle
i needed mm long screws to mount this to the tv so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied
the manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options but only one shallow length of each setthe second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and hdmi ports on the back of the le
again i think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount as theyre situated rather high and central
either way its something youll want to check on your tv before ordering this producti actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company
thevideosecu swing lcd wall mount  inch extension  lb loading capacity for lcd tv monitor flat screen vesa mm mm usgets very high marks from me
its basically the same arm with a x to x vesa head on it
this second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectlyi understand that its a very affordable mount and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement
however i just cant give this mount any higher rating than i haveyou would be crazy to buy here its cheaper anywhere else
update  i see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so i retractalso discovered another negative when browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites except amazon now fancy that
it will stay on amazon about  seconds then pop back to where ever i was before web browsing
ive tried it over and over does it every timethanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook
it is more complicated now but doable
im debating about giving it a try
updated there are things to like about the nook butno android marketbn wants your credit card to download free apps   aint gonna happenstuff that is free on android market cost money at the bn app store
ie
angry birds costs  but is free from android marketi bought this nook because it was rootable but no longer with the latest update bn blocks attempt to root the deviceboo hiss on bn
i never buy anything apple because of the closed system
i totally believe in open architecture for electronic devices
the closed system only benefits the seller not the userif all you want is a reader email and the web
then hey go for it
but i truly disappointed and may return iti pulled the trigger on three of these on preorder back in november
id cancelled my order for as many kindle fires because i felt the technical specs justified the extra  for the nook tablet
i also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since were a four person family and i drive  all three were for my wife and kids and not me and i expected theyd be used on the road a loti think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets both kindle and nook to be fair are tied to their respective distributors
that didnt come as any surprise to me i fully expected it
i knew that without modifying the device not really acceptable for your average person if you ask me i would be stuck with bns app store
what i didnt know was how woefully limited that app store really is it pales in comparison to amazons and doesnt even register when compared to the android marketplacemy daughter got hers first a late birthday present
for the most part she was satisfied with it
i made sure wifi was available throughout the house we downloaded a couple of apps angry birds of course and a drawing program
the first thing to notice is that the bn app store has a tiny selection of free apps
the adsponsored version of angry birds cant be found but for a couple of bucks i didnt mind paying  i paid for the nonad version for my phone toonetflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home ps and a bluray player both hardwired networking as long as wifi connection is good
her other use was email and since she hardly gets any the built in app was okthe other two tablets i purchased were for christmas for my wife and son and thats where the problems started
my wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesnt want to have to delete things three times
the built in email application absolutely sucks
you cant even empty the trash to completely delete messages you dont want
we experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace which also happened to be a free app
bn makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace so this app was not available at all and the selection was slim for other apps
even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with microsoft exchange servers apparently doesnt work and is very expensive for an appas i mentioned i knew id be limited to bn app store  i just didnt realize how limited that app store wasmy wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books and bought several of them
they all downloaded except one stubborn one
that book would load just fine on all the other nooks in our house the other two tablets and we have two original nooks as well
i sent an email to technical support and received the usual we got your request and will reply as soon as possible message along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests
that was a week ago and we still have not heard back
after a few days though we physically took the nook to the store to get help
nothing worked offon archiveunarchive even de and reregistered the device losing our wifi and email configs in the process
this book still will not loadwe finally side loaded the book which required installing a program on my wifes pc which is very annoying in itself and we were required to create an adobe id how much spam will we get from them i wonder
after sideloading the book it has no cover art more annoyance
that book still wont download correctly even after they told us itd be fixed in  hours that was five days agoi am not one to root products like these especially since they arent mine as i wont be the one using them
as the guy it seems im responsible for all technical support in the house and didnt want to deal with the ramifications or frankly even take the time to run through all those steps to do it
its not that i cant its that its a pain in the buttocks and i simply shouldnt have to
we were not asking for the world we were asking for a table that had nook ereader software and allowed a few other niceties
i wasnt expecting an ipad for  but i was expecting working software and a functional email programits technically not a bad tablet  the screen is bright and clear and responsive the ui is decent although i prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big n button on the nook
its solidly built and sturdy with angry birds and netflix as my only benchmarks i can say they both run much better than they do on my phone with no pauses that i saw in angry birds at allhowever the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me lets say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere the other side of the bed
i am returning all three  luckily bn has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them which is very cool of them
they have not lost me as a customer i have my books purchased from them and will continue to buyi hope them the best in the future it was a nice try
if they just werent so tight fisted about control over content especially apps in this case id have stuck with it
technically speaking the device is quite good and at the current time imo the hardware is worth the price tag
i wouldnt mind being limited to the bn app store if they actually offered more apps a lot more as they have practically nothing compared to whats available for the android community at large
again im not asking for an ipad i know the ipad can do some really cools things this tablet cant just something to make the tablet part of the nook tablet more worthwhilei imagine theyll fix glitches with the download problem too
im not the only person who had a problem but i think everyone else managed to find a solution besides sideloading
keep in mind i generally know what im doing and tried everything and the expert at the brickandmortar store couldnt fix it either
the lady from glee didnt come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet either that was disappointingso thats my review  its decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content
some will argue that its not meant to be a tablet its meant to be an ereader but lets be honest  its marketed as a tablet its called the nook tablet
it doesnt have to be an ipad but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tabletit accepts up to gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a gb card
mine would not boot because the card used too much energy
that was the only issue i had
customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card
i returned it and purchased a samsung galaxy tab  plusfunny thing is barnes and noble rrjected my reviewmixed up the review to show how the nook changed with updates within  hours of opening the boxopened the nook packaging with great anticipation
the instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentialsit passed the back pocket test famously
this was done straightaway
was very pleased with this featurebut buyer beware
i discovered this nook tablet has no camera at all
who ever heard of such a thing
there is a reasonable expectationthe nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously
everything was smooth and cheerfulthe speed of the nook was very good in my opinion
page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast
the book pages are easy to read
another dan brown book i think
made the discovery with inferno
playedwatched linux action show and other video for about  hours with about  of the battery power leftchecked youtube and amazon to see the how the graphics engine worked in the nook
the motion pictures were crisp and clear on youtube and amazon
the sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise
can hear the device clearly and with ease even though i am kinda hard of hearing
the movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics
the motion pictures were like a tv broadcast
not kiddingnow the ultimate bummer their much touted microsdhc card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer
later several hours later there was an additional patch of  upgrades that made the microsdhc capable of playing video filesmovies
the selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in android devices
the latest android operating system is  kitkat
the nook will not play certain avi or hd files
it is very persnickety  what the nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed
it can only play things downloaded from nooks libraries for salewrong as mentioned
i would have never bought this dohickey if i knew thee was no camera natively in advanceone always takes for granted a camera
and their microsdhc is nothing short of a ripoff
jeez wrong nowmy chinese brand x tablets can play my media content in avi
mp and other popular media formats very well indeed
these brand x tablets can play far more movievideo files than the nook
their android versions are newer than the nooksthe back pocket thing was a real plus
great sound
great graphics
good speedbut these pluses can not counter balance the negatives
the camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me
now i am thinking i will keep this nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microsdhc card port capable of music and motion picture replay
forget file sharing in androidbn needs a no brainer award for greed and stupidity just like apple kindle and nexus
apple kindle and nexus deserve the nobrainer award more because the nooks microsdhc does work but has limited compatibility with the filesapps that can play these type of music and movie filesnow i have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig
may keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie filesif you need a camera dont buy thisthe price of this tablet i do lovethats about itfirst of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheapalmost the whole shell of the nook is plasticsince also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to pushthe format of the homepage i do not likeif you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and videoyou do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limitedwhats also very limited is the app storewhat a jokethe apps are all very boring and overpricedthe book are usually never freethe only up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junkeither save up your money for an ipad or or kindle firei will be returing my nookthe nook takes forever to turn the page the battery life sucks it always falls out of its case not sure if its the case or the nook i have tried both nook and kindle i recommend the kindle over the nookbought a nook in september   used it solely in my home
now its february  and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen
customer service is terrible routes your calls to all the garbage rd world countries of the world
cant undersand them and they run you through all the tier support questions for an hour
still gets you no where
finally got a return label but i hear that they send you a refurb item back
greati only bought the nook over the kindle because the nook supports drm free downloads from libraries and what not but kindle has better controls
i will find another ereader than supports drm and eat the cost myself
maybe get an extended warrantyyou can get this for about  less at bn directly plus tax or at that same lower price without tax at their sitei bought the nook color after using the original nook wifi to read a few books
im sure like many people i was drawn to the color of the screen
it is crystal clear its great for books with drawings or art in them
really brings it to life
this is about all ive really likedwhat i dont like is its heavy
compared to the original nook and the kindle its a heavy monster
the screen glares with everything
i hate seeing myself in the screen when im trying to read
the touchablilty of the screen is  times better than the bw nook
it doesnt turn when you turn the nook itself even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on
did i mention it was heavy
also i took it outside and yes i adjusted the brightness all the way up
however i could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting
its like my iphone cant see the screen in sunlight
this is the part that frustrated me the most
also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading
the battery life is pretty short too
overall i wouldnt recommend this ereader
get the kindle youll be much happier and its cheaper
also kindle books dont charge tax to buy them like nookbooksi bought this with my brother for fathers day
i tried to help him use the product thinking that im a reasonably educated personthe main problem that we had was trying to read google ebooks in pdf format
i tried different methods
downloading directly didnt work
and they will tell you this too as their help desk told me
and downloading it from a pc and transferring iteven after going to a nook kiosk they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support
apparently they just dont workthis whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustratingother huge negatives
not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesnt doo much for you and isnt that simple to usemy advice
get a refurbished ipad
youll be happier for the small price premium over a nook color
it does so much more and is worth the pricei finally was convinced that i could enjoy an ebook reader did my research and settled on the nook color
my goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure maybe even some business documents
even though i have an iphone i thought i would diversify and go after an android based platform
i figured that even if i decided to go with the ipad eventually i could use the nook app on the ipad to read the books that ive boughtafter a few weeks of using it im close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with android and getting an ipad the quality is low
the software is buggy ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo
the battery charge socket seems to be flakey so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now cant buy books when youre outside the us
so on an international business trip  when itd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe  one cant buy a book
that sucks although in theory i could load a bunch of pdf documents onto it for reading the display is too small for them
the interface for pdf documents in terms of adjusting fonts scrolling is very limited
device is useless for this the book selection is slim
i dont think my tastes are that obscure but im not interested in the mass market
forget pulling out old sci fi classics
forget getting a textbook
and i find that some of the books that i would like to read are available for the kindle but not the nook the iphone nook app is super buggy
in theory it should let me sync get my books on the iphone too
but the iphone app just hangs and doesnt sync to my account even after a reinstall
if you read the reviews of the nook app on the app store theyre all saying this the app selection is slim
email doesnt work with outlook and theres no vpn supportbetter to just get an ipad clearlyi am dissatisfied with bn nook this product is only good at their site
and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindlei bought three of these
i was very very happy of the performance with the original  firmware
however two of them already upgraded to the  firmware which immediately erased the ability to use the look functions as internet browserone of the readers frost during update and it doesnt recognize the nook menu button anymorei will return it luckily it is within the original retail return periodthe second reader seems ok it is less responsive now though after the upgradewill test it with imported through callibre books tonight if it is still ok after firmware updatethe third reader hasnt updated yet i dont know why
i will return it anyway  i dont want to take the riskconclusion bn completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update
it is definitely not worth the money right nowi have the first generation nook too and in general i preferred nook due to the epub support
i integrated with callibre and used embedded fonts for nonlatin epub booksi promoted my nook readers to friends until this firmware update because of the ok hardware and epub support
however considering that bn is much less popular than its competitor and popularity means software and application support and it has no text or word doc files support and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content i am strongly not recommending purchase of the device
it is ok if given free for a brand new unitfor what i wanted it to do namely display some of the pdf files and books that i already have on hand this does a pretty poor job of it
the default software is not compatible with many wouldbe useful formats such as txt or rtf
there is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you
the settings page is a joke there is almost no customization to be had there
the shops main view was nonfunctional out of the box every time i tried to access it it kicked me back out to the main page and i had to access it by going to the top  page instead and even then the search would sometimes not work
the battery capacity went down  over  days so i dont think that it would make the  month mark that it should havefor all of its failings it gets much better once it is rooted as underneath it all it is still an android  device
once that happens you have access to the android market email web browser and more importantly you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader
you can even put amazons android kindle reader on it as wellthe reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default
the default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me and it seems like bn were just being lazy when putting it together
rooting it is also a pain and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android os on an eink interface i still think that it is better than the default software
i would rate this as  if it came unlocked by defaultok i got this thing and plugged it in as instructed to which it responded by doing nothing
after some further research i found that it likes to be updated
i followed the instructions on the nook website and downloaded the newest version and  nothing
the little monster came back just as dumb as before
it does show cute screens but not yet anything productive
so far not impressedi bought this to replace a sony prs that i thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning
yes the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but i am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter
i am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook  ive yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions
why arent nooks plug and play
thats my first big problem
i have no problem with my sony and the library book i wanted is now on my sony
the second is that i like to read while im eating my lunch  ereader in left hand and fork in right
it is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating  the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side
the sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center which is perfect placement
i read the great reviews on the nook and for the price i thought it was worth a try
im also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general
i dont need wifi on my ereader but it looks like theyre all offering it now
i also dont appreciate my registration info being used by bn as permission to start emailing me crap  i am already unsubscribed from that service
im definitely not happy with the nook and im going to save up my money to buy another sony
update   i finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming i finally found help online
i have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page
this was a very bad buy for me
i bought a bookstyle cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as i find the cover just gets in the way
i did not know how good i had it with the sony prs and will continue to use my sony instead of the nook
i dont recommend the nook at allthe device physically is relatively good for the money
there are many reviews on youtube and other places that address that point
the problem with the bn system is the fact that you must enter a default credit card to be able to use or purchase any books
if you were to buy this nook for your young son or daughter they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger and it would charge to your credit card for your convenience
similarly if anyone found your childs nook they too could purchase anything using your credit card informationi tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the childs account bn still requires a credit card to be onfile in order to unlock the book
by contrast with the kindle system you simply buy a book through amazon using any credit card which does not have to stay active and send it to an authorized device
the nook system by comparison is slow clunky and a massive security riskif you setup the nook and do not provide this credit card during setup no books can be sent to the nook wirelessly they must be synced with a cable tethered to a computer
since my  yearold daughter purchased this herself with her own money i have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control
furthermore it would appear that bn is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard
by opting out of this model you are left with an utterly useless devicewhy none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me
i suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child id avoid any device related to bn altogetheri give them  starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device in this case is useless
while you can delete your credit card from bn the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card order download sync unlock and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device
either that or hand your child your visa and tell them to enjoy
now thats what i call conveniencethis is an update from my initial reviewthis barnes  noble nook simple touch was advertised by blueproton at amazon as having been marked down from  to  so it certainly seemed like a great deal
it now seems like fraudulent advertising because ive since read that the msrp is initially i had serious problems with the nook and requested a refund
the seller blueproton refused to take returns or give a refund for it and directed me to barnes  noble who referred me back to the seller stating  that the seller should refund it within  days at that time  id only had it a few days
my amazon a to z claim ended with amazon siding with the seller blueproton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on nooks  something i did not see when i initially read their policybecause neither blueproton nor barnes  noble would take responsibility for the defective product and their attitude was take the money and run
 im giving the nook a low review although later i found an update for the nook which resolved the problems  with no help or information from either seller or barnes  noblei now enjoy using the nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading  and to carry back  forth to work each day or to travel with
i dont like the gray screen which requires you to face the nook towards the light and i dont like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights
i have to sit just so to read it  which somewhat defeats the idea of portability
overall i do like it but it needs improvementmy favorite use of the nook is to borrow my local librarys digital books using the free overdrive media console software which allows you to select  save your library ies and to directly access the digital library from it on your pc and then sideload drag  dropthe borrowed books to your nook no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse borrow or return books downtown and no more parking hassles
most of my librarys digital books are in epub format which is the native format of the nook
however as other reviewers have stated you can still borrow or buy kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to epub via the free calibre software
borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan periodordinarily i dont buy many fiction books because i rarely read any of them more than once
additionally due to the poor customer service from both amazon who owns kindle and barnes  noble who owns nook i am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies and will primarily download either their free books or the librarys loan books
the companies want us to buy their ebooks but wont take responsibility for their ereaders so that infuriates me and alienates me for lifethe pros the low price comfort convenience savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something youll only read once no clutter of physical books easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in  days automatic returns ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free calibre software
the nook can also read your pdf filesdocuments from your pc or elsewhere plus it can use your jpeg files of photos to use as your custom screensavers the nook will convert them to bw
the cons plueprotons and barnes  nobless total lack of responsibility for their defective nooks  why i gave the nook such a low rating amazons siding with blue protons irresponsible returns policy dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be  often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a responseover all im pleased with my nook simple touch now that i managed to fix it by myself but the companies irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for lifethis thing was a paperweight from the mint i opened it
and the customer service is just awful
it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it i could not use it
went back to the kindlei bought the nook touch instead of the kindle because it was on sale for  which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books
i didnt realize that if you buy books from bn you can only read them on your nook and not on anything else
so even though you paid for them those books really arent your property
you have no access to them if you dont use their products
still i liked the fact that it used epub and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more epub books available
however i just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from bn
 if i had known this i never would have bought the nook
its as consumer unfriendly as you can get
really a nasty way to do business
amazon is different
once you buy a book it is yours
you can read it on any device
when it comes to buying books amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly
the kindle is by far a better choice of the twoi am returning the nook after only a week because this is a frustrating product that doesnt function like it is supposed to do
there are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable
here are the cons  first it often takes multiple touches to access anything
you touch or swipe the screen and nothing happens
you try it again and still nothing
what a joke
second pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning both forward and backward
i am always losing my place when i try to read a book
ive noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the nook
if youre reclining and turn to adjust the pillow dont expect to return back to the same page you were on
third the popup menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident
if you hold the nook too close to the screen or at the top or bottom the popup menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally
this happens several times an hour
you cant just simply sit down relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap
last of all it does not use a standard usbmicro usb cable
the usb connection to the computer is standard but the micro usb connection to the nook itself is not
it is thinner and wider
you can only use the cord provided with the nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries
you cant use the standard usb cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets like your digital camera or your portable hard drive
so if you need a longer cord or lose their cord youre out of luck
talk about a major inconvenience one that makes zero sense
pros i did like that it recharges in under  hours and that it has a very long battery lifereceived this as a gift last christmas  months ago
manual claims that at a typical rate of reading one should be able to use it for a month on one charge
my battery already lasts only     hrs on one charge before the unit wont start due to a low battery level requiring recharging
this is either a false claim on the part of b  n or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality
ive used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years if this thing suffers from a battery problem then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality  lemon nicad rechargeables i use to encounter  years ago
keep awayi am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader
i bought the nook for these reasons  it reads industrystandard epubformat ebooks  its tightly integrated with the bn ebook store  the ebooks are encrypted in a welldocumented easilyunderstood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in say your ipads nook reader software or even in a sony reader with the very latest firmware without having to be repurchased because of drm nonsensethe problem is that the nook simply doesnt live up to its promise
the paperwhite display is more an offbeige and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light necessary because it has no backlight as is true for all epaper devices
its heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day
the  day battery life in reality for me has been a day battery life read a book and it needs to be recharged and be darn sure to turn it off
the thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software
the latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudofolders which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the nook is to scroll through its book list get about  books on the list and youre in for major pain but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us whove gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our headssad to say i really cant recommend any current ebook reader
either theyre too clumsy to use nook have no books available for them sony or have a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor kindle
im seriously considering buying an ipad yes it will only work for  hours or so on a battery charge but thats true of the nook too in real actual use and the ipad is usable for a lot of other things too
its just disappointing that i cant get an epaperbased reader that meets my criteria nonproprietary ebook format long battery life compact decent user interface and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor
well i dont like crippled so ill look elsewhere thank you very muchi had to put generic android on it because barnes and noble had it so hamstrung
should have gone with the new  nexus
no built in gps turned out to be a major lacki am already a kindle owner and i love my kindle
the kindle does have some limitations most especially in the handling of pdfs
the kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdfs you upload
this is where i found the nook hd more useful apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the play store
in handling big pdfs the nook hd is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdfs is not very smooth
i really tried to love the nook but did not and so i did not use it beyond the first month
i will not recommend the nook
if your goal is the android store just get a nexus tablet and download bn app
it is cheap and works much better than the nookhaving all the ipad models  different android models i can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing
i realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there
granted there are price differences and for price alone this is a decent dealthe hardware itself is impressive
bought these for our  and  years which were upgrading from their galaxy   tablets
the most significant issue with these tablets is the bn version of an already outdated android osice cream sandwich not the latest jelly bean which is far far better
it is very clunky and very slow not at all snappy by any sense even with the latest updates
i did buy it as they finally put play on it which was a requirement for me but the os itself is just horrible
it does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can openadditionally as this is an overlay os it is very limited in terms of options
sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles etc
many apps on the google store will indicate not compatible with this device
i generally rom my android devices however cm is the only one at this time with any support and that rom is very very buggy compared to say frosty rom which is not available for this tablet
it works but again not a smooth integration of a rom
so really your stuck with what bn puts on it and at this time it is very slow and clunky
now you can buy a card with jelly bean on it but again pulling off the card is slower vs internal memory though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a real android os on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this timefor the kids they still like the tablet enjoy the better graphics larger screen etc
once going graphics is good sound is adequate though not great touch input is good
but for me i could never use this tablet for serious use
my asus tft is my go to tablet even over my ipad etc
at this time i am contemplating just selling these and buy nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older android os
perhaps if bn releases an os based on jelly bean it may improve thingsbottom line there are far better options in the android worldprosgood resolutiontouch is goodgreat balance of size not large nor small like a  tablethas play installedexternal memory card optionconsbn os is horrible slow cluncky and based on old ice cream sandwich not jelly beanspeakers are just okvery limited accessory options compared to even kindle hd devicescharger plug is very tight on both of my models
perhaps it will loosen up over time
never had a tablet exhibit this in the pastlack of support from the aftermarket in terns of rom availabilityno cameraold slow wifi hardware and you will notice this
download speeds compared to my other tablets is very slowbought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my nook tablet
wished i could just get the cable as the ac plug works fine
after  weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again
this is the rd barnes and noble cable i have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again
any plain micro usb cable will charge the nook tabletso save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable insteadworks great but wasnt what i expected 
thanks  sent it back
sorry
maybe it will be good for a conferance room but not for singing too recordi got this for my computer to use with my magic jack and i got no sound or nothing
it may not be compatible with magic jack but more like skype
since i dont have skype there is no way of knowing if it would work with skype or compatible with itthis film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of samuel clemenss classicas one example the book has great  fun with the scenes involving aunt polly a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever and the genuinely shrewd tom who plays on catering  to pollys illusions about her own wit
this is a far cry from beautiful  intelligent celeste holms portrayal of polly  and the familys poverty  clearly seen in the book disappears as the sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy widow douglassome of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original
toms taking  off to quotplay piratesquot after becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kids escape after aunt polly tells him how quotno goodquot  his father was  the humour and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  quotfirst lovequot is gone
the theme of toms learning responsibility  is overworked and sequences that are hilarious in the book sunday school  classroom etc are largely left out
the enchanting becky thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy
and isnt much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a songanddance outing for families
tom  sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents  lets not turn it  into a commentary on quotfamily valuesquot a la s political  correctness
johnny whitakers singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard
his rendition of quotif i were godquot  aside from its text having nothing to do with the story  toms only  church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug is pure purgatory  for the listenerive used this cover with both a kindle generation  and a nook
surprisingly this case is better designed for a nook for two reasonsthe sleeppower button location
on the nook the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port
however on the kindle the button  which requires a slide not a press  is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold
this isnt a deal breaker for me but i was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the kindle
so when i want to wake up my kindle i have to move the corner hold slide the switch and then readjust the corner hold
not easy to do because the hold has a lot of good tension way directional key
the notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right
because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook it slides easily but ive never had it come out
i have however had it slide far right inside the cover and then when i shut the cover its at such a position that it hits the  way directional key and starts to advance chapters
i thought it was just a fluke at first but then it kept happening
if i do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now
the nook lacks this  way directional key entirely so again  no issues there
this issue might also be contributed to the breaking in of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles
i dont believe ive been rough with the case though so i can only assume its common weari also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design  though in truth i dont think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closedim starting my review over and changing this from  stars i like it to  stars i dont like it at first i praised it highly based upon initial expectations but now that i actually used it for work im seeing it may not be the case for meive tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware ecovue to the otterbox
i always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the moleskine ipad case
i placed my order on nov th and after nearly  weeks it finally arrivedinitial reactions i like the case
it was thick and felt pretty solid
i liked the way the case held the ipad and overall the case seemed really well built
now i dont have any issues with the build quality
the case is built very well
and others have complained about the thickness well i expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it
my measurement its just at the  mark in terms of thicknesswhat did i likeconstruction quality very nicely madeipad protection the ipad is held very securely in the case big pluslove that it has a notebook unfortunately its not a standard size which makes this a minus as welllooks professional
this is one of the best looking cases i have seenmy issue comes into the issues i found while using the casefirst off the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case
this means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad
its a minor inconvenience but if im in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts its nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it
now in most meetings i am actively taking notes but in other meetings im just a observer so when i am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distractionsecond replacement notebooks
i have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any
i found some small jr legal pads and tried those and yes they work but they dont sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and i think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric
i think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve
this is just a guess
and since you cant at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial  pagesthird no pen loop
they give you a notebook and a spot for your ipad but nowhere to hook a pen
yes i can carry a pen in my pocket but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or ipad stylus like the pogosketchfourth the true lefthandedness of the case
the case can in fact be used by left handed people but that causes a few issues
first off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone
then my biggest complaint the ipad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top
this also means the microphone is opposite the home button
so when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you
i use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the ipad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly
when i use the moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversationsfifth no stand
it would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on its back
its not sold as a case with a stand but come on for topping the  mark you would think it would have oneall in all its  nice to finally have a case built well with a notepad
but given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak
i can use the case in right handed mode but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isnt as functional as it should be
they instead should release a second model that is built for left handed and not make one unit semireversiblei may end up returning this case and going back to my marware
im going to keep using it until the end of this week before decidingupdate i have returned the case back to amazon and have gone back to themarware ecovue for ipad
this out of all the cases i have use is the best for my personal situation
i wanted to like the moleskine case but it just didnt work for me and i still cant find replacement notepads
sorry moleskine perhaps revision  will be the one for me but so far your case didnt meet my expectationsit doesnt connect
it reckognizes that theres internet service somewhere but after i get to the logon network screen it doesnt connectdrive simply will not mount
i imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but im returning mine as nonfunctioningi got this to use with a linux based xbmc media center on a zbox as the dvd player
it was recognized out of the box
it plays dvds great until it just quits
ill have to buy another drive as this one is not working for mesometimes cheap is good
you go a long way with your buck
with this machine i ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning
my computer wouldnt even recognize the damn thing
i had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned
i would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it inrun time in my regulated jetbeam flashlight was about  of what it should be with these batteries which were freshly charged
well under powered and capacity
theyre going to be replaced immediately with any battery other than this one
these batteries will see second string dutywouldnt buy this again
i never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case onnot as good as the built in mic of my nexus  which i was looking to improve
theres some static on all recordings and im not sure what to do about it
it was cheap so im not too broken hearted about itas a microphone this thing works fine
however if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isnt loud enough
i have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic
and then if you have skype in forget it because you will never hear the thing ring
but the mic works and it is little moneyi bought this device so i can use my laptop and charge my phone during travel to other european countries
but few hours after using it the fuse blew up and the device didnt work after that
very disapppointedthe usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked
im not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but i never saw either of them turn on either
it was difficult to fit grounded us plugs in without some serious shoving and the fakey plastic ground doesnt retract so i couldnt use it on outlets that didnt have a ground socket common in hong kong
its also quite big and heavy to travel withoriginal review this cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the asus brand cable that came with the nexus  its the same length
but the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enoughupdate we recently made a trip and i took this cable along along with the original asus charger
big mistake
as noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my nexus  i left it plugged in overnight and it was only at  the next morning
when i returned home i tried the charger with this cable and found that after  minutes the batter charge increased from  to 
using the same charger and the original asus cable for the same  minutes the battery had increases from  to 
i left the nexus  connected to the charger with the asus cable and it reached  charge after about an hourthe cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my pc but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable
ergo the downgrade in my rating from  to  starsthe price seems to reflect the product here unfortunately
i bought this to be used during a short film production
it worked about  of the time
it would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor
havent tested on other monitor as we were to busy working but this cable negatively affected my production having to wait to start rolling as we didnt have an imagei will like be returning this product
you get what you pay forlike another reviewer here i can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism
on my nakamichi bx they frequently stop during recording or playback
its a tension problem wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage basically it thinks the tape is stuck
cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes
ive had no problem with other commercially available cassettes on this deckmy advice if you have these tapes is to run them a bit before you record to them
pop em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape then rewind fully
maybe a few times
with one tape after recording one side just fine it was stopping every  seconds no matter where i started from on the opposite side until i performed the above
ymmv
recorded audio sounds finei would add that these are recommended in the nakamichi owners manual
go figurethe cassette as other have said makes a clicking noise as it runs
i have it in a  rav oem stereo
it will also cut out when tracks change on the music player
very annoying
i would not have bought this except for the maxell name
disappointedi am unsure of the benefit of using this cd lens cleaner
it may have solved the problem of a dirtydusty lens but it may not have as the problem on one cd player was only temporarily resolved
another cd player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all and on all of my players that did it could not advance to the third track which contains only music
significant skipping was noticed on all cd players including those that never skip on other discs
if nothing else this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix but if your cd players lens needs cleaning there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problemeasy to use cleaned the cd player  but the cds still skipordering a cd cleaner next
sighthe cds are borrowed from the libary so maybe they are in really bad shape
worked for most i guessi tried this with a cdrom player that was not recognizing the cd
initially it seemed to help a little bit
but the problem returned quite soon
so i tried using the cleaner again i think three times in a row
the problem really never went awayi purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews i read
it cost a little more but i know maxell to be a good brand
the directions are not clear enough for me  they assume you already understand how the thing works
then i couldnt get it to work
it was supposed to go in and then start talking
of the  slots i tried it in it only worked inone and it wouldnt come out without tweezers that scratched the disk
i have a bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine
i had some minor problems with one slot and i was assured the cleaner would take care of it
i never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything
i am afraid to put it in anything for fear i wont be able to get it out again
i dont know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesnt work withthe radio seems good at first but they dont hold up to longterm use in the shower
ive had two of these which have died after several months of use and am trying a different brand insteadworked well but after about one year it died
im guessing water got into it
my daughter used it in her shower and im thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the showeri bought this player about a year and a half ago
it worked great for about  months
it played all the dvds and cds
unfortunately it cannot read vcds or cdrrws
for most people that doesnt matter i guess
however only after about  months of light usage the player started to actup
sometimes it wont read the dvdsthe player indicated quotno discquot in player
i unplugged it and it worked after replugging it  minute later
then it doesnt work again and i repeated the same procedure of unplugging
finally i sent the player back to rca
since it was still under warranty all i had to do was pay for shipping
it came back after about a month
it worked and then i started to see the problem again within a couple of days
i was confused
why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work
so i tested it out to see the prob
myself
it appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak and being unable to read the disc i thought could be due to the fact that rca had provided a weak motor part
i was half right
i removed the plug from the upspower supply and plugged it directly into the wall
ever since the player was plugged directly into the wall it shows no problem
i think i may have found a solution for nowthe difficulty in reading the disc i concluded was due to lack of power believe it or not
well if you have the same problem try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player
it might workbeside this the machine is good
it played every single dvds ive ever rented or bought
i have this hooked up to my reciever through toslink optical cable
the sound is excellentgood proportion of sound from center satellite rear and subwoofer
it plays cd but it takes a second or  to skip to songs
basically dont expect it to play it like a real cd player
it sounded just as good though
the picture quality is excellent
eventhough i dont have an hdtv i could still clearly see the improvement over the vhs or betamax tapes
im getting rid of it now because i want a new and better player that also plays vcdsthis was my third purchase of this model
i had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this new set didnt have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that i had purchased over the  years
i changed to cc radio plus sets which do what i had wished this ge set would doused a panasonic ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone
plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fineso beware the operation of the unit is uncertainif you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok but for modems and internet connections your speed will go dooooooown to  or even lessi installed this product and tried several ac outletsbut the phone always produced backgound hiss and staticwithin a week it quit working and i could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund
i got a different brand that does not have the background noise
i hope it laststhis product does not have caller id and makes a hissing sound that is irritating
i bought it from buyaccessories who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase
i will buy from them again
its not their fault the product is mediocrethese rca wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances
dont bother trying to use them for data such as with tivo or a computer
they simply wont work
they use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the housei thought i ordered both receiver and transmitter had to reorder by phone
they told me they would send me a ra by email and i never got it now im stuck with two ordersi decided i wanted a headset so that i could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house
i looked at both this uniden headset and  the atampt one that is also sold on amazon
even though i read the  reviews on here that said this headset can easily break i went ahead and  bought one for cheap off the amazoncom outlet
i used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it
it was comfortable on my head easy to  adjust sounded good and i never got any complaints from people i was  talking tothen it brokeso now im about to shell out some more  money for the atampt headset and i figured id share my new found wisdom  with everyone elsethe wireless modemphone jack idea is a great one but it rarely works the way it is intended
whether its interference from other electronics old house wiring or any number of things it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection
if youre using this for either a modem security system that requires a phone line or a telephone jack its likely not going to give you the results you want
my recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day
it may be a more expensive option but its by far the best onei tried this to use a fax two floors above my vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty
sometimes it worked but many times id get a poor line condition error message when i tried to faxi finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls
it was a pain but i finally got my fax to work all the timeworks ok not worth the price tag new
i purchased refurb for half the price of new
sounds is not cd quality
sound is similar to fm radio as the device broadcasts over a fm signal
i live in a condo and placed  speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room
now i can listen to my comcast music choice and cds thru out my homei purchased these speakers about a year ago
if youd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example
im on amazon right now buying replacements another brand for these that have completely failed
they worked fine at first then got fuzzier
one quit completely tonight no powernothing
the other still works with lots of fuzz
i find myself retuning the signal a lot
time for a replacement
if you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand
im trying the acoustic research aws now
they supposedly have better range
dont settle for cheap unless you have to
youll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long
dont say we didnt warn youthese were great at first purchase but they did not hold up very well
they were used only inside the home and handled carefully
one side speaker went and then a few months later the other one stopped as well
they lasted less than one year
dont waste your moneywe opted instead for phillips oneill sho
these are extremely comfortable around your head noisereducing fab soundthere is a slight reduction in regular lowfrequency noise as in air travel but these are not nearly as effective as bose or audiotechnicai previously had a pair of sony noisecancellers
the big downfall of the maxells are the battery pack
its about halfway down the cord
if you use them at a desk and move much youll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and itll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones
the sonys only used a single aaa battery but the maxells use two
so sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation
oddly the sonys seem to have much better battery life for me
the maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use
if you wear them for hours at a time the similarly priced sonys are easier on the ear
im not wild about the way the maxells fold up either
the sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage
another problem with the maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic
often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plasticonplastic noise that comes through quite loud
with a slight redesign maxell could have a nice set of headphones
wait until then or try another brandthese headphones were disappointing
i bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger ac unit
these headphones do a good job of reducing the lowfrequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through
as a result the noise reduction for me was about    of the total
i also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results
they do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like ac units or vacuumsi purchased these headphones before traveling to europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great
the sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice
the battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains
i used it on both flights with great relaxation and i also used it on the chunnel and some subways with continued satisfactionthe weight length of cord and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for travelingunfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable
they are made of plastic and feel very fragile
i was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch
but worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded upin other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design
after only about a month one of the wires split and i lost the right headphone completely
and forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casingi am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again
if not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the priceive never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones but i received these as a gift
fortunately no one spent a lot of money on them because they really seem cheap to me
the construction is flimsy and theyre bulky
maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that
it offers no protection to the headphones at alli just cant see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carryon space
i dont see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off
with noise cancellation on the sound is even worse
its flat and lifelessi had recently purchased a pair of sennheiser pxs
they sound vastly better for the money
they fold down supercompactly into a nicelydesigned case and even cost a few bucks lessi dont know about the expensive noisecancellation headphones but i would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this pricei am not an audiophile but i do care about the sound i hear
i bought this headset last week mainly for the time i spend removing snow in winter
i wanted a headset that covers my ears well while sounding ok i thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice especially because my snowblower is terribly loud
well it does cover my ears comfortably well but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset
it isnt particularly great sounding and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation  rather the lack of it
it is hard to perceive much difference between nc being on or off
it does suppress some so i know it is on but it can hardly suppress anything real
i quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower but i then found it cant do much about the sound of my homes furnace as well  which is barely audible even without a headset bummeri have a sony mdrnc that i have been using for the past  years or so
it still works great just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear
if that is not one of your criteria i highly recommend it
it sounds way better is cheaper at least now it is noise cancellation works great too
see my review theredecember i really like these headphones
i also tried the sony rfrk which is in a comparable price rangewhat i liked about sony  longer battery life  hr instead of  hr theres a stand on which you can hang your headphones theres an auto onoff feature that saves battery lifewhat i didnt like about sony  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit i was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge like the palm pilots do in their cradles when i tilt my head forward at my desk since i use these at work they slide offwhat i like about advent  the sound is slightly better the battery recharging is easy plug it in and it recharges they are more comfortable than the sonyswhat i didnt like about advent  theres no recharging stand the tuning knob is in a really bad place where youd put your hands when youre putting the headphones oni didnt really care about the range because im really only using them in the same room
one thing to be aware of the advent instruction manual which nobody reads says you should plug them into the line out and not the speaker out port
the line out has a much stronger signal unless you turn up the volume on the sound source
theres also an adjustment knob youre supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level
before i did these two things i got a lot of noise
after i read the instructions and set up a strong signal i had almost no noiseoverall i really love them
i can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate and theyre comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble
december i no longer use these headphones for day to day use
after about six months i got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out the increasing amount of hiss and the random loss of stereo signal
im back to using regular wired headphones this time spending only  on an aiwa pair that i like
i still use the advent wireless headphones for occasional tv viewing where sound quality is not so important but i wouldnt recommend themyou can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk
it did not remove the scratches from my disk
waste of moneyi had a dvd that kept on not playing every other disc l got from netflix
it would say the disc was dirty or scratched
i gave any one that didnt play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work
maybe if you had dusty cds but l never got any sense that this was cleaning
more of a light polish
didnt work for medid not clean my cds as good as it says
they were still scatched
would not recommend this products to anyoneas others have noted there is only a small amount of velcro to holdalso i like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable so you dont lose the tie and then around the bundlewith the way these work you cant do thatif you want ties in different colors and you wont be using them much eg
wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it then these might be okbut for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized pick something elseboo hiss buy the  count one in my other review
for some reason these are short and they are not designed to stay on a cable like the other ones i reviewedi have used a couple of types of velcro cable ties in the past
the best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped
these have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie
you have to wrap it carefully and not particularly tightly around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks
if you unwrap the cable the tie falls off
these a just considerably more annoying to use than the type i first described
one other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you arent going to be undoing them regularly
true but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the costill never understand why reuseable cable ties are so expensive or so unavailable
these belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation
and even for that purpose i dont care for their designif you are a musician looking to tie up microphone speaker or instrument cables these are not suitablei had no idea what this cable was because i found it in my drawer one day i thought it was the vcr cable and i tried to hook it up to the tv and vcr one day and nothing happened except the reception on my tv went bland and emptyi had no idea what this cable was because i found it in my drawer one day i thought it was the vcr cable and i tried to hook it up to the tv and vcr one day and nothing happened except the reception on my tv went bland and emptyim not sure how this can be advertised as a belkin product
the cord that was sent to me is clear with two bright blue leds on the ends
it works just bring some sunglassesinstead of the pictured belkin cable i got a flimsy generic cable
total and complete rip offi ordered this cable from sewell direct
i received the cable in generic form
it was not packaged by belkin
it did not say belkin on the cable itself
it came in a plain plastic bag
my cable at home has belkin imprinted on it enclosed in belkin packaging
i returned it to sewell
they promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs
they should specify this generic or bulk packaging so that i do not waste my time ordering from themi cannot recognoze well how foot long because im japanese and the peoples other than us use metric unit
it doesnt wrok for my intension because too shortthese speakers sounded great but i do like to crank up the occasional kiss or vanhalen and these speakers just stopped working
ive never blown a speaker before but i guess thats what happenedthis device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success
now the solutionofchoice only for older machines more than  years or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that theyll be able  to connect a zip drive to any pc they encounter this most basic zip drive  should be avoided by most purchasersfact is if you need to be mobile  with your zip you should go the usb route these days
every new pc and  macintosh comes with usb connectivity and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost
this parallel port  machine is the very slowest zip drive available
if  you download files of  any size m or more you will notice the differenceyoull also notice  the difference between this model and an internal model
make sure that  you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an  external model
as has been stated in other reviews the zip has  become something of a standard nowadays and many machines come with a zip  drive preinstalledalso even though the price is attractive think  carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing
most  printers use the parallel port and although you can hook up both a printer  and this drive to the same port you cant use both simultaneously
this  is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the zip drive
it can  be done but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives
also  forget about accessing the zip drive if youve sent a print command
your  parallel zip drive will be unavilable for the duration of the printhaving said all this i absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise  the zip format
its got the broadestbased installation of any zip  format so chances are youll be able to port your data more successfully  with a zip than any other format
true mb is starting to look like  small but its still an awful lot of room for almost everything but  fullmotion fullsound videostill i have to give this product fewer  stars than it wouldve deserved two years ago simply because iomega has  come out with better stuff in the interim
for many users it would be  wiser to buy an internal zip
or better still buy an external usb  zip for current compatability and leave the internal bay available for  future installation of a jazmb
that way youll create a removable  media solution that handles both past and future needsnice looking good feel
but my rail pulled off the rubber binding after  months of light usei bought this bag for a  laptop mbp an extra battery a spare hd and some papers
not very much stuff
so i was extremely disappointed that a   leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag where the strap was stitched in the sidethis bag was used for  months before the strap ripped under normal daily usage
there was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this onewhy spend an extra hundred dollars to get the palm vx which is half the size of palm iii and then add a case which makes it about the same size as the palm iii againthis unit looks very protective because of the aluminum finish
however it is only hardened plastic  not a great shock protector
in addition i had trouble getting the catch to stay closedi got this as a gift tried it and do not use it because it adds too much additional bulki fully charged them put them in my digital camera and immediately got the low battery signal
not made is us
i do not recommend themthe palm v and vx may have seemed totally awesome but i never fell for the hype
the palm v and vx have a rechargeable lithium battery
when its day is done theres an agonizing choice go for a replacement one of these have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable aaa batteries
the palm v and vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me
if you can find that the palm vvx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher i had then it is definitely the belle of the ball
if on hand b you are practical and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld the palm vii or palm viix may be a far better optionjust alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss overin the product description it might have been helpful to mention that the software isnt available for macim going to attempt to figure out another way to get it done using these but not sure if ill be able toi work in cable modem operations
we have some  customers who buy cheap and often problematic nics ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on nic issues
the netgear fa is one of their biggest problems
made of  flimsy greenboard and quot
quot type chinese components netgears  crusade of inexpensive nics has made a joke of consistentcy
the price may  be attractive yet you would be hardpressed to find any company who would  commit to using netgear nics throughout their operation simply because  the service and quality is inconsistent
netgears customer support is  short of laughable as wellyou get what you pay for
from my point of  view i would avoid netgear linksys or any other quotoffbrandquot  nic and consider looking for one more dependable
you may pay a little more  for a com intel and smc but they are worth the price
they offer the  consistency and stability every nic user should demand  not just a  discount pricei have owned five of these ups units over the past four years
i purchased three for my mac and pc at home
then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
currently only one still works
i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down
my g mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the  inch lcd
i cant comment on other ups brands such as belkin  but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apcs popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand
my experience over the past four years has been mixed
these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance
the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years
i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries
prices vary from  to  depending on the vendor
battery life depends on many factors so i dont begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have  out of  units simply stop working is unacceptable
i bought apc branded batteries and cant explain why the recurrent failures
im frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model
just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an upsi purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green
no matter what i try they just dont seem to provide a clear distinct view
seem abnormally darker than others ive used and never give a crisp clear view
on the other hand they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones i owned feel great solid nice setbut wish id kept my  year old set instead
not good for bird watching
cant begin to imagine for sports
perhaps its my eyes
unsure but they dont compare to  year old setunlike many of the other minidisc owners on here i happen to like mp
the minidisks are greatbut for something small and light to tuck in my pocket nothing beats the rio
its at least half the size and a third the  weight of my minidisk player
and yes the size does make a difference to  many peoplei love getting free mps off the web and while i could  put them on minidisks i like being able to every day or so put a  completely different assortment of songs on the rio to listen to
its  certainly not much harder than recording a disk and im one of those people  that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition  doesnt bother me anyunfortunately the rio is not without faults
in  fact i have a hard time recommending it
 meg is definitely not enough
i got a flash card and have started having varying problems first with my  memory being unusable and then having small chunks become corrupted
am  now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and  freezing up so i have to remove the battery
oh should mention that the  first rio i got had a broken battery compartment and was returned
am still  waiting on my rebates
hate not being able to use it on windows nt and not  having usb
and the headsets that come with it are worthless for many  people
personally im not sure i even want to try the later rio models  as ive had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning  itthese inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from tv movies etc
however in terms of comfort they leave much to be desired
the flat hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin somewhat scratchy cloth material
it provides inadequate cushioning of ones ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures
a cotton or even a foam covering would be an improvementi got this from a yard sale
the cords are unwieldy
the bass is too strong and is not adjustable
stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofersi bought a new pair of motorola talkabout fv radios and it simply does not work with them
when i plug it in turn it on and press the ptt button the radio starts transmitting and doesnt stop until i shut the radio off
i knew the vox feature wouldnt work but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the ptt button
it does not
however it does work with my older talkabout which is a t but not with vox
im giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which donti was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it
i had to shut the radio off then turn it back on again
just a slight movement from the male plug that goes into the radio would cause the radio to be unusablei found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radios headset socket
the problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much not allowing a good seat
i used an xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding thus allowing a good seat of the male plug
no more weird locking of the radio anymore
i also had to do this with the other motorola headsets that came with my motorola radios as wellthe sound quality is good
i purchased these to plug into walkie talkies
as someone whos been use to wearing the actual walkie talkie unit on his pants i had to begin to clip it on my shirts because the plug and its cord are short and tight
if i wear the walkie on my belt and have the speaker on my shoulder the audio jack always pulls out of the walkie unit because of the tensionfor my purposes these are not ideal and if you are use to wearing the walkie unit on your belt line then dont purchase theseif youre okay with wearing the walkie unit on your shirt or somewhere a lot higher than your belt line then go for itwe purchased two of these in hopes of keeping the radios from falling and breaking
this would keep the radios in our guys pockets
worked great for two weeks then nothing
for both of them
they are heavy and seemed well made
bummeri was expecting the ga to be much better made than it appears to be
the case is plastic and not particularly good plastic at that
the seams between the front and back halves of the case dont fit together well leaving an unpleasant sharp edge
the leather cover is nice and unlike the plastic case gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for  or there aboutsi bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarmradio
however in reality its much larger and heavier than i expectedthe above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality
both are extremely poor
this radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying hiss
i dont live in an area with great radio reception however my boston acoustics receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations
if the grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of  stations
short wave is basically worthless on this radio as is the am bandfor  this radio is not a particularly good buy
there are much better radios for the same price or significantly less
the leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness
in its absence this radio would be worth  at the very mostbottom line  this radio looks really nice in photos but dissapoints in reality both in terms of fit and finish and tuner qualitythe grundig ga is like the pretv series anna nicole smith  hot looks feels great but not something you want to have around day in and day outto be sure its one of the nicestlooking radios youll find but as a shortwave receiver it lacks a lot  doesnt tune the whole sw spectrum why these radios just dont cover the full   mhz range is beyond me sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired and selectivity ability to separate closelyspaced stations is in adequate
plus the audio is on the tinny side
for the  or so bucks you will normally pay for this you can do much better
probably grundigs worst modeli bought this grundig porsche radio at staples a number of years ago when they were getting out of the product line
i wasnt even shopping for one
i grabbed it in a bargain bin for  since it had no box no manual no accessories and was a display model although it spent its time behind a caseunimpressive performance with very poor signal resolution awkward volume control which forces you to open the leatherette case to get to this slide control dumb
ive stacked it up to both more expensive radios that i own and less expensive ones ccradio kaito kas radio shack optimus pll  midland ermo two table radios  bose wave radio and kloss tweeter label
it comes in last every timefor local powerful radio stations it works fine but then so does a crystal radio with a short antenna challenge it a bit and its good looks get annoying really fast
use it for shortwave and you will find yourself shopping for something anything that can pick up any but the most obvious and strong sw transmissions
if i had paid any more for it i would consider it to be as valuable as an old brickreviews on  a site dedicated to dxing and ham radio operators place this unit dead last amongst the significant numbers of receivers reviewed
 points out of stay away unless you can get it for a few bucks used or on clearance and already know that what you are going to listen to is am powerful and not likely to challenge the tuner endi have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years 
i have a large collection of radios 
grundig over the years has made many good products however  the ga is certainly not one of them 
i will concur that it is beautifully designed has nice leather case and the fm section sounds decent 
the am and sw sections are practically useless 
lots of interference and noise 
only can pick up strong signals and i have experienced fading on those stations 
dxers should pass it bysnagless i thought is was a flat wound cable or something but its just a regular cable and overpriced at thati tried it on my laptop and it got stuck
i had to really tug pull and work at it to get it out
i am not happy with iti ordered both the belkin  ft cat e and the belkin  ft cat e cables since i was not sure if the  ft cable would be long enough  as it turned out the  ft cable was just what i needed so i did not use the  ft cable
the  ft cable comes in belkin packaging and markings but like other reviewers stated the  ft cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in china and there is no indication that the cable is a belkini gave this  stars because it does not appear to be a belkin product  i would give the  ft cable  starsthis cable says belkin on the box but the protective sheathing is of a poor quality
 feet is a long length and if the quality is poor you can expect crimping snaging twisting and a mangled mess
i bought this cable anyway
i used the cable for three weeks
i removed the cable after three weeks
junk after three weeksall those who say star  maybe they only used it for a day
after they got paid for writing a glowing review they junked it after  week
plan to junk yours too
hey it is only your hard earned money
so whati cannot tell you how much it hurts me to write such a poor review
dam you belkinvery high level of noise three pixels on all the time
otherwise its about as good as a low quality surveillance cam
i dont know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around
for the price its ok in good light forget it when the light begins to fade
the software is somewhat deficient too
when i tried to do a video capture it froze upi would not recommend this to anyonei think peoples expectations of web cams are so low that they rate things at  or  stars too easilythis camera is lousy and isnt worth the detailsinstallationgood
installed on a wink pro sp
no problem at allcolor terrible
no matter how you set the controls use auto or manual or mess with the settings the greenredblue color rendition is always awful
color shades are all wrong  either too vivid too washed out too green to intense etcframe rate terrible
there are  settings for picture quality vs frame rate
on quothighquot quality you get a nice smooth picture with soso color and a frame rate of  fps i measured it
on medium the picture is very grainy so you can turn down the sharpness which helps quotsomewhatquot  frame rate is now  fps
on quotlowquot the picture is downright awful with grain and jagged lines and the frame rate is still only about  fpsit cannot do  fps nowhere near it not at x x x
forget itcpu good
uses about the same as other good webcams ive tried  about  of a piii  mhz to capture x at  fpslight sensitivity good
the picture quality does not degrade and the frame rate doesnt drop in low light and the picture is plenty bright enough
unfortunately the picture is never good and the frame rate is never good so this is of little valuego try a logitech quickcam pro  or an intel cs and youll see what a good web cam is capable ofif you want to convert your vhs video tapes into digital format and dont want to purchase an expensive video capture card this is an alternativeive been able to convert vhs tapes into decent mpg real and microsoft windows media files in size  x  but not without some hassle
as an earlier reviewer pointed out the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it workingheres my first experience
i use windows  on a piii mhz with  ram and  gig eide harddrive
when dazzle arrived i followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the usb port and then discovered that this software only works with windows  i visited the dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called movie star is you want to use it with windows  i wound up ordering the software for more  plus shipping
once i received the new disk i installed it and once again it did not detect the unit when i plugged it into the usb port
and again i visited the dazzle web site
i discovered that they have posted a patch for the movie star software that fixes quotsome minor problemsquot i downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine i was able to get it to detect the unitthe next step was to get dazzle to work with my cheap mitsubishi vhs player
i was able to get it to work with the svideo port from my panasonic dv camcorder but i couldnt get it to detect the output plugs from the vhs player
finally after rebooting the machine twice i got it to worknext getting the software to work was another challange
despite having a fast machine with a lot of ram i found the movie star program to be very unstable
i was able to capture up to  minutes of video and save it to the mpeg format but everytime i tried to edit or export the video as windows media or real it crashed the machine
i downloaded a copy of uleads video studio but couldnt figure out how to import mpeg files
i finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free day trial of adobe premier
i found premier to be a very stable and easy to use program
i just wish it didnt cost so much
for my trouble i found the output from dazzle to be satisfactory
you would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an svideo cable into the back of your pc
another better alternative would be to use firewire
i always use firewire with my panasonic dv camcorder and it works great
after my experience i cannot recommend this unit to others
i dont think its fair that this company charges windows  users extra  for buggy software
and i think they could improve the usb connect so it isnt so difficult to use
i am giving this unit two stars because it does the job but only after spending a lot of time and some additional money to make it workfirst time i plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly
captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a p with megs rami then installed a usb cd writer
the  dazzle device no longer works
i really dont care what installing the cd  writer did i see this as a major flaw
my usb cd writer and usb zip drive  work perfectly
im now forced to use this device on another much slower  computer
nothing about this is mentioned on their sitethis product is  very flakey
after making changes to video settings you must exit the  program unplug the device plug it back in and restart the capture  program
this seems to be dazzles solution for every problem ive  encountered with this piece of uhm plasticit feels as if this product  was rushed out in a quotjust make it workquot strategy
dazzle  obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing  itstay away
get a digital camcorder and dv card insteadif you want a small low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio or you have forever to wait on the audio sync this one is for you
oh yea dont expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorderif  you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it  done at a reasonable speed you probably dont want this one or any other  usb or similarly slow external connectiondvds work just fine in this playerbut i purchased it with the intention of viewing home movie vcdsnot happeninno matter what i try vcdsvcddifferent cdr disks this model will not play themive seen dvd players costing under  play the very same vcds without any problemsi have owned this player for approximately  years and have learned all or at least most of its foibles
there are several major problems you should be aware of with this unit lip synch problems
the audio and video streams will unpredictably go out of synch from time to time requiring you to stop the dics and restart to get the streams back in synch
 noticeable video artifacting jaggies combing moire etc
on ordinary dvd discs that have scenes with difficult mpeg encoding
 poor handling of many discs with extremely subtle scratches
one disc we rented talented mr ripley was so bad that the sony sd would not play an entire chapter of the movie
however the el cheapo dvd player in my dinosaur laptop computer playerd it without incident
 most of the time the player spontaneously turns itself off about ten seconds after you turn it on
when i turn it on a second time it stays on properly
it doesnt matter if there is a dvd in the tray or not or if you turn it on from the front panel or with the remote slow transition from one dvd layer to the nextin short buying this machine was a bad idea when it was first introduced
today there must be literally scores of better models out there
buy one of them insteadmy neighbor and i bought this charger but i returned mine and i think she is going to return hers also
it seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time both nimh and nicad
so if your battery is only slightly discharged itll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead
it also cant charge batteries individually which my rayovac charger can
the only downfall of my rayovac is that it can only charge aa and aaa which is all i need
i paid  dollars for the energizer and the rayovac was only  dollars  big difference
if you can find a rayovac recharger at your local store get it
i even got  nimh batteries for  dollars  plus theyre all mah higher the rating the more power
just thought id let everyone know
alohazi have to agree with other users that this is a great product but its not as practical as you may think
a usb sync cable is a better idea
talk about convenience
secondly the cable is too long
who needs  or  or cable to connect a palm to a laptop  computer
the reason why im writing this review is because i havent been able to find a usb sync cable
i called palm there is none available
i visited the stores there is none available
will anybody have the brilliant and obvious idea of creating this device
i also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with usb ports and dont want anything to do with legacy hardwareive had this player for about six months
about  of the dvds that i own have at least one feature that can crash this player when that happens  the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button none of the  other buttons will work
the remote control design is pathetic half of the  buttons are hidden by a cover and are virtually inaccessable
the skip and  fast forward functions are combined on a single key to fastforward you  must hold down the skip button for several seconds if you dont hold it  down long enough it skips to the next scene
the skip backwards function  doesnt work it can only return to the start of a scene not an earlier  one
so if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie  from the beginningthis travel kit takes too much space
if you would like to connect your palm v or vx to two computers i suggest you either buy another cradle or pack your cradle
a cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit and  its better
remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if  you have a computer with an infrared port but this drains the batteries a  loti got all excited since this was a very inexpensive tripod and the reviews were good
got the item and the first time i used it for christmas eve photosthe lever that releases the pan and tilt head broke off
other than that this is a good starter tripodthe only positive thing i can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap
i tried to use it several times   does its job only if the camera is positioned right on top  degrees
if you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight
i was using canon powershot s is which is really light
i cant imagine if you use it with a dslr camera
my final conclusion  it is good if you dont need to change the vertical position of the cameradoes not work for k formatting
if you need to be able to format to k this will not work
otherwise it works fine but i gave it  stars because i am unable to use it and i hope others can be saved the troubleneeded a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk
this one was cheap but very difficult to eject the disk
not satisfied with this at allwe needed a new usb floppy drive to put command programs for projects onto disks for a piece of equipment
this piece of equipment will only accept k dd disks for the project info
unfortunately this drive will not recognize k disks that already have info on them it will not format them even through a command line with unconditional override applied
i tested it with some hd disks as well just to make sure it was a hardware limitation and not a defect
the drive reads writes and formats hd disks although it is slow and noisy and seems to have some marginal head sensitivitythe one i ordered arrived not working
i see from the reviews that this happens fairly frequently
buying one of these appears to be a roll of the diceupdate  after returning this item and buying a usb floppy drive from a different manufacturer i learned that on my os windows  that the drive will probably not automatically appear
you have to open the start menu and choose computer and then click the icon for the a drive to activate the usb floppy drive
if you then doubleclick the a icon you can see the files on any floppy thats inserted into the drivethe sabrent drive may well have been a fully functioning drive i just didnt know about this little workaround at the timethe sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction
the wireless system  however is pretty bad
in an urban area you might be able to get  but even then youll get periodic interference
in a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable with more like  and fewer blasts of junkwell i had read all the reviews of this model on amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information
i expected picture quality from the  to be at least as good as my old pal sony mm
however after   weeks of using the  we had to conclude that it simply provides  inferior picture quality in most lighting situations
inferior in both  colour reproduction and in clarity whatever the technical specs
say
for  example i have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red  whatever exposure or program setting i used same with the shop model we  checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store  it didnt  appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased
we  also compared the  picture with the supposedly inferior panasonic   and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter
why
what is sony playing at
we were expecting twice the clarity  quotresolutionquot and  times the colour depth from this digital   camera as widely advertised
what are they talking about
when it comes  down  to it its about picture quality no matter what bells and whistles  the machine hasboy was i glad to get my money backlooking just at the features this is a good unit to get for a basic portable amfmsw receiver
it has a good digital tuner decent reception an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals etc
however the design of the unit has several short comingsthe biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off
leave it on the shelf and in a few weeks itll be dead
to add insult to the injury all the features that require memory channels alarms are lost when the batteries diethe second is the construction is not very sturdy
the grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around
and the telescoping antenna  like all  is a failure waiting to happen and it didim looking for a unit that has comparable features but is more sturdy has better power management and nonvolatile memoryi bought a rio and regretted the purchase  minutes after opening the packageto load software from the computer to the rio you use the audiomanager software that comes with your rio
on  of  computers i tried the rio software on the software failed to properly interact with the rio  popping up a dialog saying either your rio is busy or it has insufficient  memory
try turning your rio off then on again
a brain dead message  i  wasnt trying to copy anything to my rio so memory isnt an issue here
diamonds tech support did find a workaround that worked on  of the   failing computers thoughthe reason i bought the rio is because  memory is expandable using flash cards
more memory is good
also i have  some compact flash cards for my digital camera lying around
unfortunately  diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card a flash card even  though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard  compact flash card
the only reason i can fathom for the similar name is  duplicity on diamonds partthe other reason i bought the diamond is for  use in the gym
i grow weary of the classic rock at golds and want some  talking heads lords of acid or maybe mozart
the carry case packaged with  the player however is tedious
the fabric mesh case completely obscures  access to all controls
in fact while fumbling i accidentally placed the  rio into loop this track mode
how did i do this
there is no loop  button
several minutes of inspection between workout sets proved  fruitless
later after i got home and read the manual  fold out pamphlet  is more apt  i learned diamond overloaded the use of the multibutton
not  only does the multibutton turn but you press it for selections
if you  have a sony handycam you know the drill
however while in the gym the  rios interface had me baffled
i blame diamond for a bad interfacea  classic problem in the field of computer science is the knapsack problem
the knapsack can store only some many units and given a selection of  differentsized units the problem is to optimize how much you place into  the sack
the limited memory of the diamond is the knapsack
your mps are  the items you place into the knapsack
unfortunately when placing mps  onto the memory cards you have to select which card the mp is stored upon   either the onboard memory or the expansion
the audiomanager does not  optimize for you
leaving you to figure out how to best use every megabyte  on your rio
this lack of optimization is exceptionally tediouslooking at the  specifications the diamond rio seems a winner but after some use and  field testing i realize terrible mistakes were made
diamond duped me with  their illegitimate flash card the audiomanager isnt fully baked and the  interface to the player isnt straight forward due to one button having  more than  function
give this player a miss and wait for the rd  generation mp playersi just recently received the rio  for a fathers day gift
i wanted one to paly audible files so i was pleasently suprised to receive it
unfortunately im returning it because the device doesnt live up to its billingthe main problems  low volume
even maxd out the unit  doesnt have enough volume to drown out any background noise when listening  to the unit in a loud environment
ie
coffee house poor documentation  and software
theres little documentation with the unit to describe the  functions of the scroll wheel etc
youre on your own to figure it  out headphones the very first day i lost one of the foam caps and  had to have it replaced only to have it fall off again a number of  timesi called tech support about the volume problems and they just  responded that the rio  has better volume
it was obvious that they were  unable to talk honestly about the  since it is a product that is being  phased outhaving said all of this i did purchase the rio  and i give  it two thumbs up
the volume rocks and it has more functionality to the  controls and the layout
since the  cost over 
and has only mb of  internal memory its more expensive but in the long run i think youll be  happierbought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cardsthe ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long
it partially prints each letternumber like some of the ribbon has gotten old and wont stick to the label
i would not recommend this productthe low rating is because the product description was not thorough enough for this old mani blame brother  myself hindsight i should have investigated the product more the descriptionsaid brother m inch black on white tape for ptouch labeler   i have a ptouch labeler mistakenly thought the cartridges were for my ptouch not knowing there must be other models of ptouchi am a retired manufacturer  my old school thinking was to change model designation  when models were notcompatiblei am not satisfied with the quality of this product and i will not recommend this product to otherskkdont get me wrong as a handheld as long as your not close to any rfi source its ok but in my cara  cobalt its worthlessi spent extra money on a magnetic antenna tried chokes and even bought a noise clipper nothing made a difference
then i tried the cheapest uniden handheld cb radio that i had under the same circumstances with the same equipmentantennaetcand guess what no noise
so my advice buy a uniden radioi should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product
handhelds including this one are pretty useless without an external antenna
perhaps it was defective but this one wouldnt even pick up a broadcast  in front of my truck
nonetheless this would be a great value if it worked
it includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartmentsits a nice looking rig and it worked ok with a folding ht antenna affixed to the top
i could barely get  miles range no matter what i did or how i configured it
i used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and i used it in the car with an external roofmount antenna
both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles verified during a test with a regular mobile cb on the other endas i was tightening the external antenna connection to the radios jack the radios jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack
this was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldnt screw on more than  turn
this is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of qci sent it back for a refund
spend another  to get a fullsize name brand cb that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happieras hanheld the range is very poor
forget about using it inside a car it will not pick anything not even the weather channels
running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even  feet away
paired with  midland  mobile cb antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved there is a lot of noise making it hard to understand any conversations
the antenna was tunned with a swr meter to about  which is great but noise still present
noaa channels were clear the first two days but now barely work
also picks engine noise
tried using chokes on dc powerline and also on rf but no luck engine noise still presenti got this to use on my car as i spend quite sometime on the road but for now im quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking
it should work right out of the boxgoing on a trip to canada this week so ill be testing it further mile trip then ill decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solutionthe idea is great
love itthe implementation sucksi purchased this because of how compact it was however i barely got a  foot range with it
i asked the local cb repair shop if there was anything i could do to fix the range on it they said get a real cb the compact all in one handset units are not worth itopened the box and was impressed with the appearance
started to review each piece
the battery packs are a bit flimsy
put the fresh aa batteries in one pack and  rechargables in the other and went outside to try it
only heard static on the cb bands
tried the weather bands and heard wx  loud and clear
hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna same result on cb bands
tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results
checked antenna with another cb and it workedit appears that the midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable cbglad i bought it from amazon so there is no problem returningi bought this and sent it back almost immediately
it felt really flimsy and the battery pack seemed like a toyi purchased this unit for a road trip crosscountry
i was very disappointed with the quality
if i could return it at this point i would
range is less than  feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle
ive had other handhelds in the past with much better receptioni purchased this through amazon
the first one was late and determined lost in shipping
amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day deliveryit worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug
the plug didnt seem to fit completely into the transceiver so amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out  day postthat unit has the exact same issue
it will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose
i even went out and bought eight new radioshack rechargeable aa cost  to make sure it wasnt the batteries
it wasntthis unit gets noa crystal clear in my truck as well but no cb channels get any receptioninstead of shipping this one back to amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another cb maker i called midland radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug
if that doesnt work it goes back and i will buy elsewhereim a rank astronomy novice
i read the autostar manual word for word twice before i dared to hook it to my etx scope
so far the autostar is far far too complicated for this cpa mba to understand
the computer seems very slow to respond to commands
maybe if i read the autostar manual another dozen times ill figure some of it out
meanwhile ill use the simple controller that came with my scope
i understand that remote completelyi can not say it is not safe  as long as it does work
but a moment ago when i picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it i sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced god knows what had happened to it and i could not fit my key in
ok they said they would have a lifetime warranty but i hate such kind of trouble
i guess they could provide better product with such a price
any way since it is a touch lock i like the design very much i could still give them  stars but not morethe product is great
the chinese who put it together are probably great too
but the service doesnt exist
the frame is set back too far from the edge on my new dell inspiron
i dont know  if i was marketing this i would try to find out what pcs it worked on and make a couple drop down lists on the webpage so you could find out without having to order it pull it out of the package see that it doesnt work try to get it back in the package buy a roll of tape pay over half the cost to send it back and then get know notification that it was received and no notification when it supposedly gets credited back into my account
when you send it back they have you download two forms
each form is the same and contains both forms
if i wanted to see how angry i could make people id quit my job and go work for them
i would say that qualifies as nonexistent servicethe track ball often slips by the sensors on the mouse causing it to not pick up certain motions
there are better track ball mice out therei liked this mouse fine  and the first time it went out on me in a relatively short amount of time i figured i would give it the benefit of the doubt and get another
the second one also lasted only a very short time less than  months
then i got a third one and this one started acting screwy within the first few months
it is awful
i cant believe they charge this much for something so lamedont waste your moneyi did my homework and though i knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model i still thought that overall many people had been happy with it
i have used trackballs before to a limited extent and my husband has the kensington optical trackball with the cool red glow but i wanted something that would better match my mac
well forget about that
the orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after usei had cleaned it several times in the first week and i am a clean freak where the area around my mac is concerned
i found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place
after two weeks i sent this back to amazon
it is pretty it should work better but after thinking it over i ditched matching went out to staples and tried the logitech marble mouse
it is a great fit for my hand and now resides on my desk
the marble mouse is cheaper too which is odd
if i hadnt wanted a trackball right away i would have bought it at amazon
your options arent that great pricewise as far as trackballs go which makes the marble mouse a really good deal unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmedi ordered this and used it for  month then it stopped working all togetheri now am without a track ballthis was a good starter card for watching television through my computer
it worked well with windows  but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century youd find yourself out of luck
initially with  i thought very highly of the tv wonder
however upon upgrading to windows  i had to download extra drivers from ati which ended up locking up the computer after watching tv for more than a few minutes
after that i thought xp would handle it a little better
unfortunately it was worse
i couldnt find any software support from ati that would coexist with windows xp and have yet toin retrospect i probably should have gone with the tv wonder ve which is compatible with windows xp after downloading an updated driver from atis siteat first blush this unit looks promising keeping in mind that one shouldnt expect miracles given the selling price etc
one of the cassette mechanisms on this particular teac wr developed a loud electronic hum which had also translated to the recording as well as the playback mode after only  weeks of extremely light use  a virtual outofbox failure
i returned the item for a replacement ever the optimist or simply too stupid to know better and am awaiting the new unit
i must add that unfortunately my experience with teac products has always been disappointing at best at present i have  teac products and all suffer from a malfunction of some sort on at least one of the features
i actually purchased this wr to replace via aux the suddenly nonfunctioning cassete decks on my teac dcd compact hifi system rather than trash the whole system
those just quit outoftheblue
these failures seem to happen too regularly to attribute to a series of coincidences
just saying beware i suppose
sometimes a bargain isnt always a bargainafter owning a teac tape recorder since  that i was very happy with i wanted a second one so i purchased this unit
what a dissapointment
it cliked and clanked when the tape engaged
it didnt have a earphone jackmy fault i should have looked closer
after a couple weeks of use it wouldnt accept the audio feed in order to record so i returned iti have had this changer for approximately  weeks past the amazon  day return policy unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me
jvc will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealerat first there were seldom random skips garbles and lyric repeats
these have become more frequent and annoying
pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help
my ten year old yamaha changer it has drawer problems plays my discs flawlesslyso far this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse
everything else is working and i do like the unit
the sound quality is superior to my old yamaha and the remote is betteri do not know if this unit can be fixed or like with cars the repair people cannot duplicate the problemi am not going to put a lot of time energy or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt
maybe dvd changers are made better and i can use one as a cd playeri am disappointed to say the least and from my experience i know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble
i hope your purchase goes betterupdate i took the unit in for warranty repair
they replaced the laser and on the technicians equipment both analog and optical cable connections were tested the unit played flawlessly
on my home system with a new optical cable i again had the original problems
i gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection
it must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so i no longer believe it is the unit itself
i have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together
i conclude that was my situationthis product is made in china and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying
this product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format
i liked the original product much much better  not happy
try to find maxell sku  upc  to see if it does the jobtried this in my sony jvc magnavox and panasonic vhs vcrs and it does not work properly on any of themthe cleaner tape stops at various periods of time and never completes a cleaning cycle
it is intermittent at bestdont wast your moneywarranted for lifetime but  dollars return each even if shipped multiples for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility
they can be shipped for  dollars or less no matter how many very easily so koss is definitely cheating us here
used to be  dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this  dollar for new priceear buds themselves are fairly good usually last me about  months when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good
they fit well and stay in good tooive owned  pairs of these and they do provide ok
sound quality for the price
however ive since switched to another brand of inear headphones jvc marshmallowlove em due to several shortcomings of this product difficulty in acheiving optimum sound you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get wellbalanced sound cheap cord its too thin and flimsy tangles too easily cranial reverb every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on sound quality isnt really that great compared to the jvcsthere are better value choices out there id recommend skipping thesethese werent as good as id hoped
when i put them in it made my music too loud the least thing they fell out generally they did not work for meworks fine as a basic set of earphones
however the onesizefitsall foam earplug doesnt quite fit right and pops out quite easily
instead move on and look for a set with rubber caps that they often ship with  different sizes  these fit better stay put without fatiguing the eari found these to be a waste of money and time
they didnt stay in my ears i have very small ears no matter how i tried i could not get them to fit properly even the smallest cushion caused discomfort
the only thing they have going for them is that they are cutethese earphones sound quite good for the price
however after owning two pairs over the last couple years  experimenting with them in every way i can think of i cannot get them to stay inside my ears
you would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure  not popping out
koss gives you different size covers but all of them do the same thing within a minute or two these always pop out
the cord is also unnecessarily long
it is a shame because  they do sound quite good and when they are in securely they isolate noise around you making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music
i recommend you spend a bit more money  buy the shure ec earhones which give you a number of ear canal fittings and which sound very much betterthese are probably the best units in the  range
the sound is pretty decent for the price if if you get them inserted and postioned correctly
if they are slightly out of perfect insertion easy to do either bass or highs will suffer
with that said i really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better
as i said it is a hassle to get a good insertionfit with these the pinchrollwait for expansion thing is not quick
once you do you dont want to move around because they will shift andor fall out very easily in my experience
this last point is a deal killer for me
save up  more and go with the sony exl if you are on a budget or look at the shure line if you have money to burndont expect these to last for more than  months before one of the sides stop working
used them for  hr a day  days a week for exercising and they broke after  months
very poorly made and  for a warranty replacementi have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after  months
koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after  months with my new ones the same thing happened
for the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay forgreat sound while they worked
one earpiece just quit working all of a suddeni wanted to give the plug a fair shot so i bought a pair
first of all everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true they are worthless
the foam expands way too fast for you to compress it shove it in your ear and have it expand to get a good sealso i followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here and modified some rollup foam earplugs
now at least they will stay in my earsi am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the sony mdrexsl fontopia earbuds and heres whythey seal really well to your ear canals once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter
the result is excellent bassyou can put them in and pull them out really quickly
on insertion they just go in and seal there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal
you can quickly yank one or both of them out and be able to plug them right back in
this is really a good thing if you want to use them at workthe sound of the sony earbuds is just plain superior to the koss
really it is
they are worth twice the money of the koss which is about what they costabout the only reason i may keep the koss around is that with my foam earplug modification they probably block more ambient noise than the sonys and they seem to be more efficient more volume for a given drive level
these two factors make them a good candidate for use when i am riding my motorcycle
if it werent for this i wouldnt even consider them over the sonysi bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle
this application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner
the plug received good reviews on a few mc forums so i had to try itthe noise isolation is ok about as good as theklipsch image s comfortfit noiseisolating earphoneswith silicone mushroomtype seals
the photo of these kosses is deceptive though and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big
not only does it snag on my snugfitting shoei each time i remove it the sharp edges of the silvercolored ring also dig into my earlobes
the klipsch are similarly too long but at least they have no sharp edges
for any other application these are probably a good value for moneytldr if your helmet fits correctly these wont
im returning themive tried out a number of noisecancelling and isolating headphones with an ipod
here are my impressionsshure ec isolating the most accurate and open i know of
with highquality source electtronics and material these or the ecs would be the pick of the lot
unfortunately theyre too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an ipod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context
their other disadvantage is obvious theyre quite expensivesennheiser pxc  noisecancelling these are my favorites
very accurate without being too unforgiving for an ipod
their disadvantages  comparatively bulky  wont play as loudly as any of the others mentioned heresennheiser cxb isolating considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the pxc  these are also quite good
bass can be very tubby that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts but that would more than double the pricekoss the plug isolating laughably innacurate
buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes
otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternativesi owned a pair of the older blue and yellow koss plugs and i modified them to fit better using flents earplugs instead of the one koss supplied see the headwize website for modifications you can do
those worked ok though they were still a little uncomfortable
when i ordered this new version of plugs i could not get them to fit right and the sound was really tinny
fortunately i found the sony exlps
much more comfortable than these thank goodness
no earphones fit everyone well and the koss earphones dont work well at all it you have shallow ears
the sonys also cost three times more than the koss but the comfort is worth itthe plug offers very poor balance across the sound spectrum they are very bass heavyboomy resulting in a very muddy sound
unless you listen to your music with the bass turned all the way up i suggest looking elsewhere
also the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratchgouge your ear canal
overall a poor choiceas a long time philips he user i was looking for something better or at least as good
in a headtohead comparision the results are clear
the koss require more power on the signal to create the sound x more
the bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor
there is not nearly as much bass as the he
compared to the he it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal canthese did not sound well at all and fit was even worse
ears got tired after just a few minutes during one songi ordered these because my very favorite earbuds broke and needed a cheap pair untill they are fixed
you get what you pay for
not comfortable and they have a feedback
airbuds makes a pair calledthe most comfortable earbuds  well they are and have fantastic soundi bought these to knock out some of the noise from a busy mph street i walk next to for my walking commute
i carefully squished the pads and let them expand in my ears forming a fairly high pressure seal
they maybe take a couple db off the road noise barely taking the edge off
i can drop down the volume a notch or two from where i would with my other open air koss headphones
but that is more because there is a tube shooting the music into your ears
sound is not up to my other cheap koss headphones
and the wires could literally not be any thinner or more delicate
i bought these koss because i like my other cheap koss overearclip openair headphones so much and the cord was nice and  beefy on those
i tried someones suggestion of replacing the pads with official ear plugs trimmed to length and a hole punched through
that helped a tiny bit more
noise leak seems to be right through the headphone itself
if you try to replace the pads i suggest scissors a heated ice pick pointy chopsticks and lots of patienceheres the good stuff great isolation from outside noise comfortable damned near excellent bass and very power efficient
but im returning my pair to tower records where i just bought them for 
why
because the sound itself is truly awful compressed dead flat hazy and tinny the great bass notwithstanding
these phones literally suck the life out of my music by destroying its dynamics detail rhythm tonal accuracy and high frequencies and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that
i cant say enough bad things about the actual sound
i suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentists office
i know i didi thought these would be a good travel idea to block out external noise
that they do in a small cheap package
for that they get a  instead of a the bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well
but it simply sounded thuddy and muddy  were talking quantity over quality in the bass department
in fact these are probably the worst sounding headphones ive ever used
in the end i preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones a nothingfancy sony pair than listening to thesei also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods but that can be a highly personal thingall in all the best part of these was taking them outdoesnt have much range
this definitely decreased the volume in my headphones
it works as a volume control but it shouldnt decrease the volume to do sowhereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume the range is limited from no sound to the volume youd have without it
i had gotten the apparently mistaken impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources like zune ipod but that does not appear to be the case
since you can always lower the volume on the source mp player etc
 im having a hard time seeing the value of this device  except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline controlpurchased to be used to adjust the volume of my pro aat phones while snoozing at night the tiny volume control no balance and flimsy construction make these useless for meat  not worth the hassle of returningkoss should not put their name on such a piece of junk
next time ill pay more and buy something betteri used this to control the volume of a  speaker system
however it does not control it properly
the sound gets switched between speakers sometimes other times it just does not reduce the volume
havent tried it with a headphone thoughfeels and looks cheap
it seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality
its a little embarrassing using this ugly thing when i really like the look and feel of my headphonesit didnt take much use before the volume control stopped responding and the cord began shorting out the audio playbackdoes what it says works as expected
cord and jack look a little spindly compared to everything else i have but so far so good
very small and light making it highly portable if you need it to be
about  of reach
ive only had this for a week or so well worth the  as long as it survives a respectable lifespanupdatei cant remember how long i got out of this but it wasnt long enough a few months
i really like inline volume controls but will choose a different one next time
this unit got touchy and created buzzing
look for something with better quality cableshieldingan inline volume control is a great idea  weve used sony headphones in the past that offered this but the headphone quality was poor
when i saw the koss volume control i was happy i could get back the control while still using my high quality phonesunfortunately the max volume with the koss installed is diminished quite a bit
id say about  lower than regular headphones aloneanother issue is the small size of the slider  i find myself fumbling to find the slider and use it
something with a bit more of a thumb switch would be better
i understand you dont want something that can be easily bumped accidentally but the tiny slider bar this unit currently has is just not adequatebecause theres no other options ive found for something like this ill stick with the koss volume control but if there were other options id jump in an instantdeveloped a short in the jack after  uses
sound was fine until then now its a constant struggle to get the plug situated so that there is no staticthe volume control degraded the sound quality significantly
if you use it with a cheap earphone it may be ok for you definitely not enevn with koss portapro or kscthe earphones are fine but they create too much pressure physically on the skull ears
they dont just sit they squeeze onto your ears
definitely a minus for me
maybe ill get used to them but so far i feel it was a bad callnot sure if anyone else experienced this but mine had some wierd rattle on the left ear that went away if i hit it hard enough or let it play for a few seconds
if i let it cool down the issue would come back
not sure what it was but had that not been a problem i might have kept them
the sound was average and i do not understand why people say it had ridiculous bass i dont think it did
this is an average sounding headphone by comparison
nothing to write home about
i got the sony v and those are very good glad i got those would like to try the audio technica m one day
i also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like  those also suck the jvc gumy earbuds sound way better
i think those earbuds represent a good value like the pinnacle pn
i know thats not an earphone but the gumys really are  that good of a value at  bucks
anyways i might give these portapro another chanceprobably not thoughi really wanted to love these
after reading rave reviews about their quality and history i thought these would be great for listening to music and podcasts at the office
for years ive been wearing a pair of cheapo earbuds philips flexible earhook headphones shs black replaces shs that were extremely comfortable and got the job done but i decided it was time to upgrade to something with better sound
soundwise i honestly wasnt blown away by these
yes they offer more bass than most portable headphones but the bass on these strikes me as muddy and overpowering
in terms of comfort after several hours of use my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headband even with the comfort zone switches set to the lightest setting
in contrast i can wear my  philips earbuds all day with no fatigue or discomfort
this might not be an issue if youre not planning on extended listening sessions theyre fine for an hour or so but if youre planning on wearing them for longer periods youre in for a headachethese are not what i expected based on the reviews i read  price paid
they are on the flimsy side imo  do not sound any better than most other cheaper  flimsy headphones ive tried
if i had to do it over again  would have spent more  bought some gradosthe space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the earsif you have big ears or a big noggin dont get thesethese phones sound great for the price
i have owned  of them and the plug will short out in  months or less if you use them often
i have purchased  because i see them as disposable toy junk
i have not found a better sounding phone for  dollars so i see it as  dollar per year deal
i have grado s and  sennheisers  hd  pros for  years with no problems but they are bulky and heavy for travel and exercisei have owned sennheisers s and s and they sound as good but no better and they cost  times more and the last  months or less as well or snap like a rotten twigi may buy the koss pros again and tape the plug area to reduce the stress but i know that  months or so they will end up in the trash
buy them but no one i know has had a pair last longer than a year with light use
if they are lost or stolen you will not feel bad as the person who steals of finds them will get the honor to throw them away
its a shame but koss has destroyed their once good name because their quality has been lost and i wonder how they can compete with other companies who make phone with fashion and style and the durability to stand the stress from younger folks who wear phones for hours everyday
i guess a week tops and they will short outi had a pair of portapros for years and years
when they finally wore out i didnt feel bad replacing them
i bought a second pair on amazon last year  and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use
reading the sportapro review the plug seems to be a weak link and im afraid that the portapros have the same issue now
its really a bummer they used to be great
not sure what to replace them withi bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last im on my third pair
when they work they are ok but every  months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back
i suggest throwing your money elsewherekoss portapro headphones with case broke on me after a year or so of use the cable in particular
cheaply made cables go with vmodathe headphones are great however a few issues that i had st pair left speaker phone inoperative after  weeks use nd pair left speaker inoperative after  weeks of normal use
only other comment not complaint  the comfort zone adjustment defaults automatically to firm and will not stay on the light adjustment
great speakers poor design and manufacturing
companies like koss do not like constructive input but ill give them another try
after all i live in moogville nc aka bob mooggod bless rip
aka asheville nc former home to bob moog and current home to the moog museum and moogfest and of courseasheville nc music capital of the carolinas
peace
love and joy  btw amazon has been wonderful to deal with regarding my returns and replacements thats why i continually shop amazon not walsmart or kart or targot or bust buy
shop amazoni had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pairthe replacement pair was not made the same and dont sound as good as my old pairthese are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old modeli bought these headphones thinking i was moving up slightly from my koss sportapros
wrong
they are a half step down in sound quality
specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a tinnier soundthese headphones are great and its a quotanybodys choicequot
its firm and light
solid headbandsmetalpros coolfirmness is great
firm mild and quotdid you see my headphonesquotportablelight designcons cheap cordask me for a picthe plastic on it may seem solid but drop it once and it breaks
ask me  picplug in form of quotvquot
this makes it easy to tear off
ask pic  see differencesound slightly above average but no competition against panasonici really hesitated when i saw it i knew that it would break
and i was right a fall of a meter and theres my money flying by
i highly recommend to people who are careful and one last tip fold the headphones so that it doesnt break
dont fear breaking it by folding the phones close to the metal bands and bending the thing like a metal bar
i like the design but i wished that the body was metal only not plasticthe three stars missing are for the bad cord
its cheap
youre supposed to be careful and not dropping it once and its over otherwise its a must buyi got these because the low price good sound quality and they are collapsablethey do all those they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable
they pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time
i stopped using them all together and now they just collect dustsound is good overall but these dont wear well
miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic platesbased on all the reviews i thought this was going to be a nice set of cans
unfortunately im very disappointed
im comparing them to the sony mdrv which in my opinion rates against headphones in the  price rangethe portapro is not a bad headphone but its not a good headphone either
the bass is present but muddy
not clear or crisp at all
the mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit
and the treble where is it
i havent heard a headphone with less treble
this lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones
are they worth the  that i paid
yes
but i wouldnt pay more than that for them
save up and buy the  sony mdrv its several tiers above the portapro not only in sound quality but in noise isolation and build quality
if you can afford the sennheiser hd i also very very highly recommend them as wellbought my wifes pair in sept  they are still greatbought a pair for me in october  and they are trashkoss changed the molded connector from a strainreliefed right angle stereo mini plug to a straight onethe wire insulation separated just outside the molded strain reliefif yours arrives with a straight connector send it backwe are very easy on there use them to listen to ipads in bed
thats itvery disappointed with new productionso i read that koss has a warranty just send them in with  for return shippingthat covers the total production cost including return shippingthe connector overmolding is no better than a  set of ear buds from epayim replacing them with sennheiser px ii
thanks gizmodowish i would have bought a different pair as now im back on here searching for replacementsthe sound of these is decent but youll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little usedo yourself a favor and buy something more durableas of  amazons page on these r headphones states detachable foot single entry coiled cord with  mm inch plug and  mm inch screwon type adapter for flexibility and reliability
i can assure you that the item which amazon just shipped me does not have a detachable cordamazons description also suggests and  mm inch screwon type adapter is included
it is not in the product
however that is not a deal breaker i have a few of these laying aroundsound quality is good and the fit is good for my large head and does a good job but not excellent of isolating outside noiseim still debating whether to return these to amazon because of the cord not being detachable it was one of the primary reasons i wanted to purchase this set of headphonesthese dont adjust small enough for me to wear
ive bought lots of headphones over the years without issue  if you are a big person these might be finei recently purchased a pair of the koss r and all i can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of  dollar head phones
the problem is the cord was defective on both pairs i ordered i had to replace the first pair the right channel would cut in and out
i wish i could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but i cant
i would avoid the koss rline of head phones and look else wherethese headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds like the phone ringing baby crying etc
without difficulty
the problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvaslike material that in my case without extreme use opened up in several places exposing the wires
koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product however it costs one third of the items price plus shipping to send it back and it will most likely have the same problem
dont waste your money get something elseboth camera body and lens appear to have been made in japan
but in using the equipment will entail a lot of guess work though
the exposure meter is quite difficult to figure as theres no indicator light or arrow to set proper exposureas of now im still deciding if ill keep or return the whole package
so please provide instructions on how to return everything
the merchant globooks does not even have a a mailing address
but nonetheless i would like to know how i can return everythingthanksmike caguin panorama dr se  auburn wa  i bought this camera to replace an older model of quickcam which looks the same and is also usb
i replaced it because for some reason windows xp doesnt like it and it cant be used with xp since the os upgrade
this camera installed easy but i had to dl the xp software off the web as the software it came with is old
i expected at least the same quality as the other since its been years and i now have the best os available
no
the picture quality is crap and cant be tweaked
there is this total grainy appearance to the images and the dpi seems much less even though its still dpi
dont waste your moneyi dont see any resolutionquality differences with the more expensive models eithergood luckmikelistening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket
everything sounds muted the highs dont extend very far the lows are almost non existent
their sound is anything but clear
dynamics
forget about itim looking for a ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times
i figured these might do the jobbut wow was i wrongi found the sony mdrxd which is actually cheaper sound much better
did i mention the build quality sucks
the xds are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired
perhaps thats just low end sonys in generalim thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of sennheiser pxs or akg kdjsmy main headphones are the grado sr and beyerdynamic dtsi know what good sounds like
all my music is either flac or  kbps vbr mpsim giving these headphones a two star because ive heard worseand much better for cheaperim wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop which is good
the bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoegoo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece
that is to say the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it doesnt move
the overthehead thing is taped together with packaging tap because it too broke when i put the things on my rather large head
they sound fine and all but i could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood
do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcasemaybe i should just glue to the earpieces to my headthese headphones have nothing but boomy bass
highly imbalanced sound
i am sort of an audiophile but when i bought a  headphones i did not expect the moon and the stars
sad to say i was let down
the basic headphones that came with my discman sound clearer than thesetried them out with my dell laptop sony discman and harman kardon amp
bad performance in every case
allowed  hours of break in still only slight difference
they sound as if the music is lost somewhere within and all you hear are muffled thuds
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony
i would give a total thumbs down to this productif all you want to hear is boom and dont care about clarity or balance in sound then maybe this is for you else stay away
i am returning minewell i embarked on finding a new set of travel headphones after my last long plane ride
the earbuds just werent hacking it even though the pair i have are quite good
the jet engine noise finally got to mei have an old pair of sony mdrm headphones which are quite good but i wanted something new
so i studied what was available and settled on the mdrvdj headphones
after purchasing a pair i regret my choice and i am returning themwhen i got these headphones i immediately plugged them into my ipod and picked a favorite cut from xtc mayor of simpleton
as i listened to the song i kept wondering what was wrong  then it dawned on me the treble was entirely muffled
i grabbed the mdrm and did a ab test with several tracks
same result
the mdrvdj has little or no highend
just as a sanity check i grabbed my sony mdrv phones and did the same test
i consider the mdrv one of the best headphones ever made by the way
yeah the bass was definitely richer than the mdrm which seem bright in comparison but both were much closer to what i expected than the mdrvdji thought it might be the ipod so picked a coupled of cds mfsl dark side of the moon  bernstein in berlinbeethoven symphony no to try in my portable cd player
same result
while the mdrm was the brighest of the three the lack of high end on the mdrvdj made neither cd sound good
once again the mdrv was the best and most balanced of the threestill seeking the perfect lightweight headphones i went to a local magnolia hifi to try a better comparison
i tried both noise cancelling models from sony several sennheiser models the mdrv mdrvdj and mdrv
first of all forget the noise cancelling models
none of them sounded as good as mdrvdj
the mdrv was the best of them all and reminded me of the mdrv which i understand they replaced
the mdrv is definitely better than the mdrdj by a long shot and i would say the mdrv is comparable to sennheiser hd
i am going to try them sidebyside at home soonalthough many of the sennheiser phones sounded good they seemed overpriced compared to the mdrv
the only one that was close in price and quality was the hd
by the way the hd was uncomfortable and put a lot of pressure on my headunless you like listening to bass only do not buy the mdrvdj headphonesbought this phone just for casual usage to listen music and movies at homeon the plus side the quality is awesome excellent bass and good isolation from external noiseson the minuses this thing is bulky and super heavy
it causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on
also the cups make way too much heat and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or soit may be a good headphone for djs that are constantly putting them on and off but for continuous usage there may be better optionsthe bass is really heavy on these
the build quality is not that great
i think they look really cool
i had to adjust the bass on my stereo because my ears were getting fatigued and gave me a headache after i did that i didnt have the problem again
these are designed for djs
if you want something to listen to at home and you arent worried about sound leakage get some open air cans
the  sennheiser hd  are some of the best around
if you really want closed headphones in  price range get the sony mdrv studio monitor series headphones
sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart
it took me a lot of time and money before i found the sound experience i wanted
always listen before you buy everyone has different preferences in sound
if you are serious about music check out the sennheiser hd  seriously amazing
you might consider pairing it with a headphone amp this is not a portable setup
id check out the schiit asgard they have a  day trial or something but there are many many other ones out there and you might be happy without out it
i picked up an old stereo receiver for im not exactly a headphone connoisseur but i can tell you that these headphones have impressive sound
i upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds
the bass on these things is quite strong its actually rather painful at anything too high
however if you read the reviews for these things you will find that the common theme is that they break around the swivel thing
i was determined to be the dude who takes good care of his headphones and doesnt break them
not so
although these are some of the sexiest phones around they are not made to last
the plastic on the hingeswivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose
mine lasted only about a month
the sound still sounds fine but the swivels are in shambles
dont buy these if you want them for longer than a couple of months
for the price the longevity of these is a shamethese will break on you very quickly  believe me  im a dj thats given up and decided to go to the s
what happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these the swivel cupsplastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your headthey will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfrs warrantycountless other djs will tell you the same thing save your money and get something better  the hd s sound better fit better and give you more value for your money
they are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceableunlike sonys s
do the right thing dont buy these
youll be happy you listened to my advicemy first pair lasted  years
somewhere along the line sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing
most of their headphones are designed this way
after a few months the ear pads come apart at the seams
within a year bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face
within two years the ear pads will be completely shreddedthese are lowquality overpriced headphones
you will do better with other brandsi used to think these are good but as i realized it was more a placebo thing because  i used to think sony makes the best electronics so it would naturally include headphones  i was ignorant in the world of headphones
do your research sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like sennheiser grado and akg
these brands are in my opinion the best in the business
after listening to jazz with my akg  and switching over to the sony i feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard
the sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my akg
dont believe me
read all the bad reviews in any review web site not just this site and you will hear the same thing muddy
sony headphones sound muddy
i own  sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics loud muddy and bassy
now  and  are not bad qualities but  is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound
now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds but that doesnt necessarily mean they are any goodtheres so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones
theres always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengthsbut even at that these headphones are pretty disappointingthese headphones have great depth boomy but in midranges they lack a lot of detail
the sound is full but very flat
crispness is really lacking
if youve heard some higherend headphones or are the sort of person that appreciates highend satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphoneson the plus side they are very comfortable to wear
they also do a very good job of sealing the sound in so people nearby wont hear your music if youre wearing these
so they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound qualityworth serious consideration instead for a closedisolating headphone wdj functionality would be the sony mdrvwhich are similar in construction but beat the v in every way or the akg kdj which also produces far superior sound for the same money
those are not quite as comfortable as the sonysbut sure sound betterthis is the third time i have ordered a plantronics product
i had to return two of them
ist set of earhones just didnt work and the latest was the plantronics overheadear headset mc
out of the box the headset had a loose connection
the slightest movement caused it to cut out
returned the product to the sellerthe headset fits the standard mm jack found on many cordless phones
the fit is comfortable and the sound is fine both incoming and outgoing
however mine broke just shy of two months after i bought itby trying to be all things to all people this headset is a compromise
if you just want something to wear over your head youll find plantronics mc to be better and half the price
get that instead
just to be clear i do own both this and the mcexcited about this based on good reviews but did not have the same experiencetested on my nexus s cell phone person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound
i unplugged headset and switched to using my cell and they said the problem went away so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headsetalso just fyi this does not come retail packaged but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions
not a problem for me but makes me wonder where these are from and the qualityi love plantronics headsets
the one i use for skype and for my computer has worked flawlessly for over  years
the one that my boyfriend uses for his cell phone has worked flawlessly for the past three years on a daily basis
when i needed a headset for my samsung brightsides and other cheaper brands were failing me i decided to shell out money for the plantronics mobile convertible headestthe sound quality on this headset is clear without any fuzziness or distraction
however and this is a huge however even on the highest volume setting on both the phone and the headset the person on the other end of the phone has a very very quiet voice
you are constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said and for me thats a problem
i tried fooling with the settings
i have had everything from ear buds to headsets with the brightside and the plantronics convertible headset has the lowest sound of any of themthe convertible feature is nice
you can use it as an over the ear headset or a headband style headset
i was not interested in the over the ear headset offering so i immediately made it into a headband style headset
the little ball that the headband attachment seats into is not very sturdy and the constant swivel makes it easy to break if you arent careful
i do like the swivel motion so that you can adjust the ear cushion to fit comfortably on your ear
one note about the headset in headband mode even though the height adjusts it doesnt adjust far either that or i have a really tall head because i couldnt get it to adjust high enough to fit comfortably near my ear it was always slightly aboveanother complaint about the headset is the side that does not have the cushion is a very weird shape with grooves and i have long hair every time i removed the headset it would get caught in my hair
i put a spare headphone cushion over it but there was nothing to keep it in place
i would literally have to yank my hair or cut my hair around the headset to remove it from my head
this is while sitting in one place with the headset placed on carefully and not adjusting it all day
i tried both with my hair down and with my hair in a pony tail and both ways the headset would get caught in my hairthis headset really defeats the hands free portion of a cell phone headset
you cannot answer a call without touching the answer button on your phone
if you are driving or multi tasking this can be a pain
i have a samsung brightside and i was having difficulties hanging up after a call i would hit the end button nothing would happen
i would hit the unlock button and then the end button and nothing would happen
it was so frustrating
i eventually would have to remove the battery from the phone after every call and put it back in to end the call not a whole lot of fun
this could have been eliminated had plantronics added a simple hang upanswer button to this headset
i know its not a difficult thing to add because every headset and ear bud set i have ever owned has one even ones that cost a third of the pricei had a lot of problems using these headsets with the samsung brightside the sound would cut in and out and make it difficult to hear the sound would have an echo to it etc
i know the samsung brightside isnt a great phone but ive had cheaper headsets with better quality with the brightside then this headset producedi did not try the over the ear mode as i am not comfortable with that kind of attachment on my ear
maybe if i wasnt dead stuck on a headset that goes over the head headband style i would have had more luck with this headset but i doubt it
after three days of using one the microphone snapped off
i decided to return both while i could to verizon and ask for a complete refund because this is definitely not what i thought i was purchasingafter not many hours of use the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate
the synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part
it looked like i probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip although it would have taken some time
but because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway i ended up throwing the whole thing away
what a waste
overall a very poor design in my viewthe sound is good but the design has a flaw and that is  the connection between the line cord and the ear piece lose connectivitythese are some of the most comfortable headphones ive ever owned
the sound quality is goodeverything comes through clearly and cleanly
unfortunately im running into the same problem a number of other people here have mentioned
static from the plug end
im not sure if its the plug itself or the wire but the slightest movement can cause static and even cause one of the speakers to cut out
its bad enough that my android devices think ive disconnected the headphones and helpfully pause the music
i returned the first pair but the second pair had the exact same problem
ive tried them on multiple devicesphone tablet pc even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with
same problem everywhere
im not sure what happened at sony but id advise staying away from these headphones until they fix the issueseveral notes mostly negative  the cord is unbelievably heavy
and the jack is massive
it may very well be designed for durability but these headphones are not portable in any sense
the headband just is not well designed
it is made of very wide metal with a vinyl padded cover
the headband bows out tremendously  i mean like  inches wider than your head on either side unless you play offensive line in the nfl
this not only looks awkward it feels awkward
essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head
this might not be a huge deal but the headphones are quite heavy compared to say any bose headphones and so you feel the whole weight of the phones on the top of your head
the earpads feel pretty nice
but when i switched back and forth between  bose aroundear headphones and these these ones were much more cramped around your ear
so not terrible but not all that roomy
the sound struck me as very bright
the most treble i have ever heard from any headphone or fullsize speaker
on certain songs this is a plus but for most it is a bit irritating
i listen to a wide variety of ss rock mostly  from rem to snoop dogg to bob dylan to the clash to soundgarden to stevie ray vaughn
in headtohead comparisons with other highend headphones i judged these to be very light in bass
its hard to say if they are deficient or the others are exaggerating the bass i am not a wannabe audiophile but to me these headphones lack fullness
on the plus side i can hear cymbals and snare much more clearly than with most headphones
but the botom line is that i need to set my equalizer to reduce treble andor increase bass to enjoy my music
and i am someone who rarely touches the tone settings on a stereo preferring a neutral sound and am particularly unlikely to feel the need to increase bass
they are not very loud
only a bit quieter than the boses but if you are using an ipod they really arent quite loud enough in my opinion
the monster beats headphones are much much louder if that is a concern for you
while they do not actively cancel noise i found them to be quite good at isolation
ambient sound was significantly reduced arguably more so than with the bosesoverall too big and heavy and uncomfortable
i would possibly overlook these issues if the sound was incredible but it lacks fullness in my opinion
it might be very good for some kinds of vocals and music but not for rock musicthe pros
very comfortable and lightweight
used with an amp the volume gets real loud
coil cable to move around real easy
very portable and easy to fold upthe cons
these headphones are trash when it comes to durabilty
they have no bass at all
the highs get real loud that it becomes very uncomfortablesummary if you like loud music with no bass at all then these are your headphones
buyer be ware speakers are known to blow out with the slightes bit of bassit just so happen to me the day i got the pair from amazon my right speaker blew out within hri packed it up and returned it all with in the same day
dont waste your money and just buy something elseas the good reviews state these are classics
great value and sound great
if you want full sound and dont want to pay a ton for the popular headphones of the day these fit the bill perfectly
amazon was selling at an unbelievable price so i jumped on themi got them because i a dont really like earbuds preferring headphone style as they stay put and sound better as a result
that said i returned these because the pleather material sony uses on the parts that touch ones ear get very warm and cause the ears to sweat
it ended up making my whole head feel warm
i guess i am a hothead but i dont know how people say they can wear them for  hours comfortably
i could have gone to the trouble of buying the  beyerdynamic velour earpad replacements others suggested which are more comfortable and wont eventually flake off but really had no interest in upgrading something brand new
sony should charge a bit more and make it right the first timefor now ill continue to use the no longer made sony sports headphones i have had for  years which work for me much better than earbuds stay cool and allow me to run or commute while wearing them all while sounding better than earbuds though not quite as good as these did
when they break ill cry since the style is no longer available and have to hope someone makes something reasonably priced comfortable and full sounding at that pointlook most people rave about these so dont let this review discourage you as all headphones of this style may be hot and uncomfortable and may just not work for me
the incrementally better sound is not worth the discomfort in my casemine went back within  hours and i lost the return shipping cost but at least amazon graciously took the return this review has been updated as of 
updated info at the end of the original review
i actually purchased these for field listening while recording commercial video and have used them occasionally as backups for enjoying my music on my laptop ipod and android phone
the sound is very good with solid bass response and crisp highs but they actually hurt my ears physically not aurally if i leave them on too longwhich usually equates in to anything more than  minutesfor the record my hat size is a   so i would say the overall size of my head is average
a person with a larger head size may find even more discomfort in a shorter amount of wear timein the past i had used the less expensive sony monitor headphones found in department stores
the sound was adequate but i felt i wanted something more professional
these are definitely a step up from the sony department store models but same uncomfortable ear fitmentthe bonus to these is they fold up nice and compact for better storage so i dont have to worry so much about breaking them
they also come with an inexpensive little carrying pouch for added protectionbottom line sound great but uncomfortable for periods of long listening
  update these did not last long
the left side stopped working and i had to throw these out
i paid too much for a pair of uncomfortable headphones that didnt even last as long as the cheaper studio monitors ive bought at target
it was enough for me to know i am done with sony headphonesi bought two of these
one of them for my so and she pinched the wire in a drawer on the desk and one of the speakers was no longer getting audio
in her work she does board level repair on everything from laptops smart phones and desktops but regardless was not able to fix the issue with a soldiering iron
the wire is mostly rubber the metal they use is extremely thin which is probably why it broke so easily in the first placemy headphones still work but the ear pads are completely worn out
i realize i can buy new pads but i shouldnt have tothese are okay headphones for the money but the earpads are totally faulty they dont last very long which is really annoying
i had to replace them at least once a year at additional cost and frustration because they split open
while you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them
sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads
the other thing is that they cook your ears
after a while wearing these your ears start to feel really hot
the ear pads also press against your ears so they start hurting after wearing these for a while
these are not made for long listening periods unfortunatelythese headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range
they are the same as the more expensive mdr models except these dont say professional on them and have less of a warrantyfor the price these headphones are fairly comfortable but not the most comfy headphones available and they sound pretty good although ive certainly heard better
there is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones
i would say these are good entrylevel monitoring headphones for audio engineers djs etc
for music lovers they are certainly usable but you wont get that tickle me ears type of wow
feeling from the sound out of them like with some other higher end headphonesif it wasnt for the truly faulty ear pads i would give these a higher ratingfirst pair i bought got stolen outta my car somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it anyway first pair sounded greati bought another pair there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency
this made me extremely annoyedangrydisappointed
i cannot stand bad crap and i hate to give bad product reviews
but i had to send it back and now i will look for a different company brand probably for the rest of my lifethis camera works fine
takes good picturesdrawbacks other than battery life only  pic review at a time as opposed to a collage review by the olympus brands
long delay from the time you hit the photo button and get a picture causes folks to relax before the pic is taken
ruins some shots
very clunky camera considering it has no optical zoomnow the battery life
i have yet been able to fill my flash memory without having to change batteries
i get about   pictures before it is flashing and beeping to tell me the battery is dead
this makes the camera unacceptable and i am looking for a new one solely for this reasonafter reading the reviews here i am perplexed
i have had major problems with this camera since day one
i bought the camera  months ago and   the flash has stopped working  the adapter plug will not stay in the  socket which means i have to hold it in while i take pictures not easy to  do
or else tape it on and  the batteries only last long enough to take  about  pictures
the quality of the photos are acceptable but using the  camera is often a nightmare
i do not enjoy using itits not sturdy at all
however it does the job that i need it for
i would have purchased something stronger that didnt feel as if it would break if i dropped it or used it frequently
flimsyi connect a usb item to these cables and maybe  of the time it works
i have to fiddle with it to really get any connection
i have older worn out cables that work better than thesei have used this when using the ipad and obviously had it plugged in and it still runs the battery down just slower than it would have otherwise
it is ok but there have got to be others out there that will work better
i mean belkin makes some great products but this is not top of the list
i use it and its ok but i would really like to find a  foot ipad cord that actually works and not rely on thsi thing
when your computer is plugged in it should not run down to  when being used
so based on thati consider this product kind of a failure and the only reason it gets  stars is that i actually do use itthis cable is advertised as having  mbps transmission speed which is false
on the packaging it says only  mbps meaning this is not a usb  cable
be careful
i would have left one star but thankfully amazon let me return the cable without any hassleif youre like me you saw this discontinued sangean and thought cool its just like sangeans tiny dt plus weather band and a speaker
want want want then i patiently waited until i found one in new conditionheres the problem with this radio standby time is about  days without using it at all and its completely dead
just sitting there running the clock will kill batteries
i had a similar sony without speaker which i left in a closet for more than a year and the battery was still workingi notice that a couple people report short battery life with the newer dt as well
maybe these things are ok if you use it every day and dont mind changing batteries constantly but dont use too much effort obtaining onewhy does all these great reviews miss the key key feature that is missingdirect push button tuning
this should be radio design a thousand versions of mp and ipod type players
numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers
why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile
radio shack built a couple of version some  to  years ago and they were excellent
i have had  or  of them but all have now broken and rs no longer offersthey do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish
could you imagine doing that on your television set with some  hundred channels
this seems such an obvious product instead of the st version of another mp player
there are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walkingthink postmen going to the beach working hiking camping etc
this is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that i can find
again radio shack had such a unit some years agoa couple of modelsi would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at rs decided to no longer offer them
sony has such a unit but you can only listen via an earphonenot thru a speaker
someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eatingit was great out of the box
within about  months the center plug somehow got bent inside so i cant plug anything into that one anymore
after  months the lock stopped working so when its extended i have to put something on the cord to keep it from reeling back in
i should also add at this point the cord may have been pulled out a couple dozen times at mostupdate  i opened it up today to see if i could get the lock to work again
turns out there are  plastic cogs that work together and one is mounted on a rivet
it had gotten a little bit bent so straightening it out seems to have fixed the problem
i also cranked the spring up another revolution so it retracts a little more forcefully and all the way to the end
easy repair with a screwdriver and pair of pliersperhaps you want to dip a toe in the waters of shortwave radio listening
in my case i wanted to give my kids a different perspective of the world around them than that which comes from the cliches and stereotypes presented on tv and in the movies
id had a decent sangean shortwave a number of years ago but was hoping that as technology marches forward decent functionality might be available in cheaper unitsright off the bat lets discard am medium wave and fm
those are commonly available
i have no interest in introducing my kids to the redfaced belligerents who populate the am band
theres no reason to listen to fm radio if someone has a decent cd collection for the car
even though the sg offers both am and fm i bought this solely for the shortwavetaking a cue from other reviews here i expected that shortwave reception would be weak but also expected that connecting this to the antenna that had been used with my component stereo system would significantly increase the number of listenable signals received
first i should say that without the external antenna this unit is a paperweight
listening at night as i used to do with the better shortwave receiver the only thing this picked up in multiple listening sessions was three or four religious broadcasts that probably are readily available on am radio if the political blowhards havent driven everybody else off the dialadding the external antenna from the component stereo did make a significant difference in reception
more signals were indeed detected
unfortunately the overwhelming majority of them were unlistenable
im not a shortwave enthusiast so im only speculating that what such listeners mean by sensitivity or selectivity is a radios ability to home in on a signal while suppressing general static and noise
most of the time when some kind of signal would be detected the sg delivered it as one chunk of coherent sound bobbing about in a sea of white noise
sifting through band after band of unlistenable signals turned up a handful of broadcasts that were coherent but significantly noisy
no radio australia or radio moscow or english language broadcasts from points around the globe but rather mostly just the occasional foreign language broadcast peppered in with the already mentioned doctrinal teachings
in short the effort required wasnt worth the parsimonious results deliveredits probably a safe guess that drift means either a signal slightly changing frequencies or a receivers inability to stay locked onto a fixed signal
with the sg i found that signals repeatedly drifted to where it was best if i kept one hand on the dial in an attempt to follow the signals shifts one way or the other
never had to do that with the shortwave receiver id used in the pastlistening to broadcasts from around the world can be a fascinating pastime an activity to share with the kids
but if you want to stick a toe in those waters just to see how you like it or how the kids take to it without spending too much this unit just isnt going to drum up any enthusiasm
it would be like buying a used yugo to see if calling the tow truck from the side of the road inspires your teen to take up driving
this fails the effortreward equation this fails the costreward equation and even when it lands a signal its the audio equivalent of watching a snowy tv screen
dont abandon the idea of trying shortwave radio but please walk up the ladder to a better higher priced model that will deliver enough listenability so that you or your kid can make an informed decision on pursuing this furtherhave owned this little radio a few years
the tuning failed to work well within several weeks
it is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weathereven sit loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible
and yes the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others
reception of fm and am are pretty good
there is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station
so if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics arent a bother this might be an acceptable choicebut radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical partsits a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choicei purchased this radio several years ago and found it to be a really fine performer
excellent sw sensitivity good am and excellent fm as wellconsidering the ats s rather small size
sound is quite good too for its size
and its got a fine assortment of settingsbuttons for improved performancethe big problem was that it didnt hold up well over the long haul
firstly the numbersletters on the buttons that i used most often rubbed off including the silver paint underneath and became totally illegible
then about a year and a half after purchase the digital clock refused to hold the correct time
i had it repaired but the clock went bad once again a few months later
and lastly the speaker went bad giving only fuzzy low fidelity sound
its now essentially unusablewere it not for the abovementioned problems id rate it five stars
at the fairly high selling price of around  the ats  should hold up for a lot longer than it didi guess that these days quality and durability of most electronic goods just arent as competent as they once weresighive had a  for  years
its gotten several thousand hours of use has fallen on the floor a few times and is still going strongits very true that this radio is hard of hearing using its whip antenna
it has inferior sensitivity
i just bought a  analog sw radio which is vastly more sensitive
you must add your own external antenna
the reel antenna will do nicely
after that the  truly performs
it can hear everything thenthe speaker is also poor
it has inferior sound
again the  analog i bought has vastly superior sound to the   the sound on the  is disappointing
i only ever listen to it using headphonesthe  has a tuning knob which is much better than updown buttons for tuning
you can tune in  khz increments
thats fine for swthe narrowwide filters are okay
not great
using the narrow filter and tuning away from an interfering station can help with the interferencethe tuning for ssb is unacceptable
ssb should not sound like donald duck in a radio with this price
if you rip off the display glass you can adjust the bfo screw and almost get ssb to zerobeat
i prefer the bfo knob on the yb pe to what the  has
poor ssb performerthe sound mutes when you tune
that is bad
i ripped my radio apart and modded the radio so it would not mutethe radio frequently beeps when you press buttons
this is annoying
i ripped my radio apart and removed the beep speakerthe memory function is very nice
nearly  pages of  memories each
most of them are preprogrammed and out of date
you have to find a cheat online to bypass the memory lock so you can store your own countries and frequenciesdecent fm and mw reception
mw dxers will not be disappointedno drm
this is an old radio
if you want drm you need to do another mod buy a mixerfilter chip pipe the signal into your computer and decode it with the appropriate softwareno synchronous detection
at this price the radio really should have had sync
it makes a huge difference in terms of listenability
sync completely removes adjacent interference and fading distortion
if you listen to sw you want it
the  doesnt have iti like the   but i must suggest you get the sony icfswgr instead
it is much cheaper
it has much better sensitivity
it has much better sound
it has synchronous detection
or if your focus is ssb get the grundig yacht boy pe
it is cheaper has better sound and zerobeats ssbsorry lovers but your radio is greatly outclassed by the competitioni have owned this hub for about a year
for the most part i was very satisfied with the hub when i was only using a couple of usb devices going into the hubhowever i recently bought a usb cdrw
on top of a printer usb keyboard etc
the cdrw was just too much
i agree with the other reviewer just spend an extra few bucks and get a robust hub that will last you a while through multiple upgradesim revising my rating downward after failing to get my printer to operate consistently with this hub despite its bulky and heavyduty power supply
when i switched to a lighter asante port hub i no longer had any problems
maybe the problem was in my usb cable because the dlink seems to be a solid welldesigned piece of equipment
the price is right so you could do worse than give it a try for yourselfthe dlink hub initially worked fine with my imac for lighter tasks
but as harry carey would say whenever a fly ball fell short of the bleachers one more biscuit for breakfast might have insured a home run
lately im finding that heavyduty print jobs involving photos are requiring me to unplug the printer from the hub and directly into the usb port of the computer
occasionally the unit causes everything to freeze when attached to its power supply then resumes functionality when i unplug its electrical source the instructions claim the unit is  times more powerful when run by electricity
fortunately at these prices you can afford to just toss it and try something elseno a good purchase not a good helper not even a good antenna
it helps with signal and of course with noiseit was a very expensive shipping
same as antennadue to the predominantly good reviews and great sangean reputation i expected more from this antenna
its easy to use but did not improve reception on any of my radios
i tried using it on a shortwave radio a weather radio and a regular amfm radio
i could not sense a difference in reception either with or without use of the antenna
sure it could have to do with my geographical location or other factors
but after three failed attempts on three different radios i am sure that the antenna holds some degree of responsibilityi live in an appartment complex which is brick and i dont get cell phone signalsso i didnt get much from this antenna from my appartmenti will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter datetwo stars for now not knowing how this works yetnice concept if it works outdoorsvery portablethe seagate stas gb mb  sata hard drive has performed as expected for me
i bought it to replace a failed iomega drive in an external usb case
the seagate drive was fairly easy to install in the external case and the included software recognized and formatted the drive with no issues
updateafter reading another review i checked my drive to see if it required a firmware update the seagate website has utilities to check and it does
the update process is cumbersomenot recommendedcfhtoday my computer suddenly stopped working
im using this seagate tb drive as a secondary hdd primary drive is much smaller and i use it to store my music movies etc
thank goodness i also back up everything to a third external drive because as it turns out the only way to get my computer to start working again was to unplug this internal seagate drive
i checked and ironically i ordered this drive a year ago to the day
so yeahthe drive was fine while it was working but one year later and it seems to be busted
not planning on buying another seagate any time soonim disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use
it was pluggedinto a standard volt outlet in a uk hotel
but it overheated witin  minutes and had to be shut down frequently
now i am using a tacima stepdown transformer
look into the proctorsilex model as well
this recoton couldnt handle the job and i was using the watt settingwhen i first plugged this into the wall upon arriving in italy i smelled smoke after about five minutes
i unplugged it and one side of the casing had started to melt
the next day i mustered the courage to plug it in again and while it did get hot really hot it didnt melt any further and i didnt smell any more smokeon the lowpower setting you cant run more than one laptop or a couple small things without it overheatingdont even try to run anything less than a big hair dryer on the highpower settingall that saidit did run my laptop charge the camera batteries charge the cell phones etc
for the whole week tripthis item offered here recoton adf w dual wattage travel converter is actually two different converters built into one package
at low setting up to w it uses a small ac transformer to convert v sinusoidal waveform into a v sinusoidal waveform
this is the preferred approach which works well for any low power applianceto handle higher power however the ac transformer must be made bulkier and heavier around  pounds just for w
this makes it impractical as a travel voltage converter for largewattage appliance
therefore another method is used by this converterat high setting w this convert simply uses a solidstate switch inside to chop off part of the v sinusoidal waveform
the resulted waveform as seen by the appliance is highly distorted and is far from an v sinusoidal ac voltagefor a purely resistive appliance such as travel iron or water heater it works just fine irregardless of different voltage waveform
but if you ever try to power an electronic appliance such as tv computer or battery charger with this distorted v waveform it will probably be fried in an instantthe product manual did warn against using the high setting for any electronic appliance exceeding w
so legally the company is covered
my advice is to stay away from this potentially destructive product  unless you are really really careful about what to plug in
chances are sooner or later somebody will forget about this warning and plug a xbox into this converter  only to get a big boomif you must bring electronic appliances with your oversea trips make sure they are rated for universal voltage of v ac
that way you can safely use them in other countries without the need for a volatge converter
power supplies for most portable electronics laptop camcorder cellphone electric shavers etc
are already designed for universal voltage although some of them may require you to physically flip a switchbut dont forget even if you dont need a voltage converter you still must bring a set of plug adapters for foreign countries
for example consider thetravel smart polarized adapter plug  piece setfor this purposebought this to replace a port cisco linksys switch
it works but the documentation is scanty
there are  leds over each port the function of these two is not differentiated in the manual
printed on the front of the unit is a small note that if an led is on continuously the port is linked and blinking indicates activity
so i hook it up and the left led on port  and the right led on port  light continuously
i download files  no blinking
i read the install manual which says if the lights do not blink that indicates a connection problem
patch cords from router are the same that worked fine with my linksys and the lights blinked to show activity
called support took  minutes with an agent who had no tech knowledge and only wanted to register me finally was transferred to nd level support
agent could not understand my concern did not know why there were  leds per port and told me dont worry everything ok ignore the manual and printing on uniti will return this unit and buy a linksys switchim not a super savvy it person but for home use i can usually handle it
i bought this and a motorola sbg from amazon and both were returned after i was never able to get everything working
its been long enough that i dont remember specifics but i remember being able to get a portion working but never all of it
i dont think there was a specific issue with this but it and the cable modem would not play in the same sandboxwhen it arrived one of the ports didnt work
i dont know if this is common with netgear products but this one is not worth the price
will not buy this brand again
going with ciscoi have several of these switches in place and every few months i start seeing huge amounts of latency and dropped packets in my internet connection
after going back and forth with various isps and checking everything else i realized the problem was in these switches
unplugging the fs waiting a second and plugging it in the problem instantly disappears
after some periods of time and possibly under occasional heavy use these switches begin to not function properly and need to be reset
once theyre reset they work fine
this is an otherwise solid unit except it cannot be left unattended and operate reliably in my experience
unfortunately thats what these switches should dodurable
i have plugged in three computers into this  port switch and all of them work fine
with the ethernet cards installed in all my systems i found the installation to be a cakewalk
the configuration is so simple and it just takes a few moments of your time
i just had to plug in the power cable first then connected the ethernet cables of all the comps and it was ready
but it needs an external power supply chord and does not have a power on switch
the metal casing makes this device quite heavy
not that i carry it around all the time but it could have been of lesser weightthe led lights and the ethernet ports are on the same side
this is a major disadvantage for me because the wires flow on my desk
had the ports been at the back i would have had some control in keeping my desk unclutteredmy fsna also gets warm after continuous usage for more than an houri have had this switch for many years and recently it has been cutting out
i have a desktop pc ps xbox  and samsung hdtv connected to it now and often when i turn my computer off then back on the switch does not work until i unplug it and plug it back ini realize the device is positively ancient but this should not happeni misunderstood what it was
i needed a wired router and actually dont know what this is for although i looked it up
my mistakedead just under  years after placed in service actual usage time about  months
powers on now and even provides some limited intermittent function between two computers connected to it but wont talk to the route and will not connect to the net which tells me the uplink port is completely shot and the other ports are about done for
warranty is for all practical intents and purposes pointless as the customer is expected to pay for shipping both ways and in the end you have a refurbished unit that only carries the original purchase date warranty ie
in my case warranty would end on  with the  year warranty this model has but shipping cost more than buying a new product
i am dropping my review to  stars since it did when all is said and done last  months which comes out to  a month at the price i paid and  a month at the current price
final verdict i will consider getting another one to replace this but only if i cant find one with a better warranty plan for about the same pricesee original review belowthere isnt really much to say about a switch it has one simple job and as long as it does it thats what counts a switch for those who are not certain is easiest to explain by saying it is akin to a power strip you can plug all the machines you want into to it but if you dont plug it into a managed source of signal such as a router or server it is like expecting a surge strip to provide power and work when it is not plugged into an ac outlet
if you want to split one lan drop network plug in at for example at your entertainment center and hook up your ps cablesatellite box internet ready tv av receiver with internet radio etc
this is for you because all a switch does is take the one ip address assigned to it by the host system and share it out over all devices connected to it while they are turned on and seeking connection of course it doesnt allot bandwidth to devices that are not currently asking for anybottom line is this does the job so far and is well constructed at this very moment unit has been plugged in for almost two weeks and is cool to the touch i have it wall mounted behind my tv were it gets plenty of airflow so time will tell but i have seen units like this in multiple brands at customer sites im a network tech work for years if this one fails in an abnormally short time i will revise my review to reflect the time and detailscircumstances of the failurethe units i received cannot be used in a reliable installation
i received my fs v this week in september  and as another reviewer from this month noted the power connection is flaky
the power cord disconnects and the unit powers off whenever i move either the unit or the cord
i returned my first one for a replacement and the second unit has the same problem so its going back for a refund
the serial numbers from my defective units are db and dgthank you amazon for your excellent returnreplacement procedurei tried very hard to like this keyboard but i just couldnt
though it  has a lot of very cool special function buttons it fails to do the basic  thing a keyboard should do be comfortable to type on
and the packaging is  mildly misleading about the nature of the usb portsi didnt find  anything particularly ergonomic about the keyboard
the curve of the  board is just a little too steep for my hands
its awkward getting to the  extreme upper corners such as the allimportant backspace key
i found  the distorted size of the bottom row of keys hard to get used to as well
and the hand rest cant be detached
most disappointingly the key action  is awkward and loud
im not sure ive ever encountered any keyboard which  felt worse under my fingertips
even the nonergonomic version of this  keyboard has keys that feel betterlikewise the muchtouted usb  ports are a mixed bag
though prominent among the advertised features the  usb ports arent sufficiently explained on the packaging
you dont  actually increase the total number of usb ports on your system by two
you  must  plug the keyboard into an existing usb port so you get a net gain of  only one port
and theyre unpowered ports which means you cant plug  bigger usb deviceslike hubs printers and scannersinto them and expect  great results
this is not a way to add usb functionality to your system  it only rearranges where the ports are
this redistribution does have its  utility however
game controllers microphones and digital audio player  downloads can be moved forward to the keyboard
if you find yourself  crawling under your desk all the time to switch out your smaller usb  devices this keyboard will add some needed convenience to your lifein sum i strongly advise anyone whos thinking of buying this keyboard  to test it first
find a demonstration model in a computer store and try  typing on it
if you like it fine come back here and buy it
as long as  you understand the limitations of the usb ports and can deal with the key  action the keyboard is actually a good value for money
but while youre  testing keyboards make sure you try a whole range of them
get one thats  really comfortable for your handsnot just one that seems to be coolperhaps this is stated in the product description but this product wouldnt work at all with the electrical box i have on the outside of my home
my box requires a metal bracket that goes across diagonally where there is a screw hole in the middle this product requires a box where there are  screws at each point of the squarethe product is also all plastic very cheap but thats not really a knock since its also very cheaply pricedafter installation two of the four fixtures did not come on after darkafter a long minute phone wait i finally spoke to a helpline person at heath zenithand they assured me i would get two replacements mailed to mei did get one replacement and have again sent a request for a second replacementthe two units that work are doing well and have no issuesi will buy a different unit next time as these obviously have a high failure rate probablythats why the price is so cheaprange said to be  feet but in reality it appears to be more like  feet
next time i will go with a new led modelyes it works but the effective range is only about  of the advertised  feet or about  feet
the cost is small enough but id rather pay more and get one that does the job
ive found that all of these have a limited lifespan anyway
can anyone tell me where i can get a decent motion detectori have  dymo letra tag label makers and in general i like them
i use the plastic tape to label my spice jars
while the print holds up to the frequent handling the labels dont stay stuck to the glass bottles
no matter how carefully i clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other and sometimes boththey also dont like to stick to the plastic capsi am disappointed with this product but havent found anything betterbtw  the metallic tape was no bettercouldnt find anyplace else on amazon to review the dymo letra tags
i am probably returning both models that i purchased
the more expensive model qx has a qwerty keyboard but prints horribly if at all
on a single line of bold text it printed just about nothing
it prints lines of normal text with contrast set at the highest level very irregularly
you can see some letters but not others
this is supposed to be their newer model
the next level down a few bucks less looks more like a calculator in its design long and narrow n
it prints really well very crisp letters even just at regular contrast
unfortunately in line mode it will not center the lines has less symbols i need inch marks and requires  batteries to the other models 
perhaps the extra power makes it print better though
im pretty disappointed
the tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make
letratag tapes provide only  feet of tape
i wanted to make labels for my garden stakes
im going to take a look at the brother and casio lines of label makers and hope theres something betteri just returned my replaytv   it terms of a review id give replay  stars but amazoncom  stars
amazon was very gracious about the return and i will certainly buy electronics from them againafter two weeks  using replay and tivo id agree with everything in photokevs review from  
if tivo didnt exist i would have kept replay which is why i gave  it  stars
its just that tivo is more reliable and has done a better job  bringing a great idea to marketmy replay suffered av flashes a  problem known about for a year which hasnt been solved despite several  software updates
these are described by owners at avsforumcom in case  you are interestedtivo doesnt suffer this serious problem
also its  ability to select programs to record based on what you have watched is one  of its best features
i didnt believe that until i tried it but it is  true
in any case i hope this helpsfinally based on my return  experience i can certainly recommend amazon for electronicsive used both replay and their competitor tivo and i have to say im much happier with tivo
for one thing replay included firewire ports on their original unit which they marketed as being available for adding  external hard drives
after a year the software still doesnt support them  and they cant say when it willive also been bitten by quite a few  software bugs and find their management mechanism for recorded programs to  be byzantine and often surprising
ive had the unit delete a program i was  watching in order to record the latest episode when it had plenty of space  and was supposed to keep several episodes of the program
also several  times ive gone to watch recorded programs and found that the unit had  crashedalso if you change recording characteristics for a show number  of episodes to store quality etc replay deletes your currently recorded  episodesive also had tivo crash but only while i was actively using  it
tivo has never failed to record a program for me and ive found their  interface for managing what to be intuitive and easy to use
some of tivos  programming guides are poorly designed thoughthe live pause feature of  both replay and tivo is wonderful and tivo is limited to  minutes  whereas replay is limited by the amount of available space usually much  more than  minutesalso be aware that the quoted times for both  replay and tivo are for lowest quality recording
youll probably find that  the lowest quality is too low and that youll want to use the next best  quality probably halving the available record timein short replay  should spending their energy on getting existing products to work reliably  and on supporting features they promised a year ago rather than  introducing new productsi have a cable system that has an ab switch
tivo does not support this
their solution is to decide between using tivo on quotaquot or  quotbquot
and when i wanted to switch it took a  hour set up
also if your system requires a cable box you probably wont be able to  watch another channel while tivo is recording
you would need another  cable box or cable tuner of some sorti bought it
i sent it back
the equipment is not completely reliable yet
i had the system freeze up twice
i became slow and unresponsive to commands on other occasions
consumer reports said they had problems with  system crashes on two units
despite the potential unreliability of hard  disks and the cost of the system no extended warranty protection is  available if you buy online some brick and mortar retailers do offer them  indepdently of philips
you have two people to deal with if there is a  problem philips and tivo and they both kept pointing fingers at each other  and claiming its they other guys problem
hold times were tolerable when  i first got the unit but had become excessive by the time i sent it back
the tv listings are not up to date  despite the fact that new program  data are downloaded daily
i also encounter occasional errors in their  listings
the software still needs work
the system got better at picking  programs for me at first but as i entered still more thumbs upthumbs down  data i got more garbage
the program is artificial stupidity  not  artificial intelligence
i gave thumbs up to quotsinging in the  rainquot and started getting everything debbie reynolds was ever in
the  season pass also needs work
its ok for broadcast networks
but if i  want a season pass for homicide life on the streets on court tv it  records the same episode four times each day same thing on any cable  channel that repeats broadcasts of particular programs
even if youre not  waiting for the price to come down my advice is wait for them to get it  right
the current version should be labelled a quotbetaquot versioni have to say in general what the unit does and the service is pretty incredible
set up wasnt too difficult  dish network  just a bit time consuming
problem is after  month the units modem fails to work
it cannot dial into tivo central for programming data
it has been a real frustrating situation  setting up  units having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement
and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy
  im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit
perhaps ill have better luck also have to say the  minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least  try doing it  or more timesi bought tivo from amazoncom saving myself the sales tax
when i got it i carefully read the instructions finding out that you couldnt use it with a digital pbx phone system but analog would be fine
when i hooked it  up it didnt connect
i called customer support multiple times but they  never returned my call when they promised
at one time i was on hold for   min
one representitive told me to send it back to amazoncom when the  unit was not defective
i had to buy another one when it had the exact  same problem for a grand total of  tivos
another rep said to go to radio  shack and buy a wireless phone jack which didnt work either
they cost me  more than they are worth
i ended up sending the other one back too
the  unit is really well designed but if i were going to buy one i would wait  until there are more competitiors
its still to early to buy onedvrs are great
i have    replays and a tivo
i highly recommend them over vcrs for all the reasons you read in all the reviews
they also work quite well with few glitches so i hadnt had much chance to test their tech support until recentlymy tivo unit is not properly contacting the server to download the program directory
this has been going on for over  weeks so now my unit wont record at all
tivo support lines have  min waits to get through
online support is very limited
upon getting thru to the first tivo number finally they sent me to a second philips number and they were closed with limited business hours
it would be one thing if this were just bad outofwarranty hardware support were all used to that
however tivo is charging month for the directory service and to not be willing to even take my call on it is frustratingive had no problems with  replay tv units which ive owned longer and would recommend them over tivo
functionally the units are essentially the same  tivos slightly easier to use but replay is slightly more flexible
my next unit will be another replaythe speed is too slow even over a mb network due to its broadcast nature
with switch price so low buy a switch instead of this onesize speed feature easy of use after upgrading to all gigabit networking i ended up using this router as a small local router for my tivo
it was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago
only port  shows activity any longer  ports  are dead
ive never had a router fail like this before and i have  in my current home network in various places all over the housei was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage  it was pumping out v under no load and v when connected to the linksys
thats  over the proper voltage v
its quite possible that overpowering the unit during its lifetime would have shortened its lifevery good workgroup switch it seems it imporved my connection a lot better and took a huge load off my router its self what used to take  seconds to load a webpage only takes like  seconds now i think it imporved my connection to the psn on ps witch my games never did lag before using this but it has imporved the connection status  ps connection overall this is prefect plus the bandwidth is  better then using the standard modem  router a must buy for those looking to improve a lot on there connection  bandwidth im most impressed with this product now its time to switch my netgrear router out with a linksys wireless or wiredvery good update using this product after  months it keeps saying there was a connection problem and i redone my connection straight into my router without the switch and my connection is all good humm well thats not good for this switch and the name on the product linksys i thought that linksys was a good product but as iv seen with this switch i dont think ill be getting a linksys routeri bought this ezxsw  years ago
there was no problem till  weeks ago
now the internet connection got very slow or i get error message  no connectionsince this product does not have a reset switch i tried to power circuit this router and cable modem
none helped
our wireless router is linksyss wrtg
this one has been working without a issue since we purchase it in  i tried to upgrade a router to linksysciscos newer n product last year but found out wrtg worked more stable so i had to return a newer one
i trusted linksys more in the past
i do not think their quality and reliability are not good any more
very sadif you are a macintosh user you should know of a very important limitation of all linksys hubs  switches including this one this switch will not route appletalk information on your network
what that means is that if you are a macintosh user who is trying to use file sharing via appletalk or if you have an older appletalk printer such as the older line of hp laserjet printers you will be out of luck with this switch or any linksys hubswitch
besides the lack of macintosh appletalk support this switch seems to work just finei bought this to replace a linksys port switch that died after several years of use
ill be surprised if this one lasts a year
i definintely got a bad one but its so inexpensive its not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either linksys or the marketplace seller
this should be a foolproof device and probably is if you get a good unit
mine on the other hand thinks there is always something connected to port  bringing down the entire network
actually connecting something to port  solved that problem but im still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about  that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct
if youre looking for an inexpensive switch i might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one keep another good one as a backup and return the remainder
otherwise spend the extra money for a switch made by a company with actual quality controlive had two linksys products die on me shortly after a year a port routerswitch and now this port switch
it works fine until it dies but thats like saying a stapler staples correctly its supposed tojust to note i run them in a very friendly environment  no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem
also you can count me as an expert user
i myself will never buy another linksys product again  ill try out netgear  dlink and other brands but goodbye ciscolinksys
if you chooose to try their products caveat emptori bought this card with the idea of using it with linux mandrake x because linksys had drivers and support page for linux installation
i finally gave up just short of recompiling the kernal network card should not be that difficult to support
after spending serveral days search the net for updated drivers and newgroup info on the card i decided it wasnt worth the effort and i put my intel  chipset card back in which now works with the latest dist of mandrake
windows install was odd but finally worked after tweeking the bios settingsi really liked this card until i bought a netgear fs  switch
no matter how i configured the lnetx card it would only talk to the switch if i forced it to mbps mode
forcing to mbps wouldnt work nor would autonegotiationif i wanted a mbps card i would have gotten one
this is a poor performeri received my zip drive about four years ago when i began developing powerpoints that exceeded  megs
it was a great storage medium at the time and the portability of the drive was very helpfuli then bought a cdrw two years ago and havent touched my zip drive since
the cdrw drives give you all the storage flexibility of the zip drives but they store more data unless you purchase the  gig zip drive theyre cheaper and more portable and can work across platforms
i can backup my files on a cd and copy them onto another computer
i can create discs of my mp files to play back on this or other computersin the end it simply is easier to burn a cd and use it on another computer
for example  some time ago i helped a friend of mine put together a presentation on a medical case he had
with all the digitized pictures and cat scans the power point and graphic files exceed several megs  too many for a floppy
i could have given him a zip disk and my zip drive but he would have had to connect the drive to his computer install the software and then copy the files over
instead i burned him a cd with the powerpoint and all supporting files
he simply placed it into the presentation computer and was using it  seconds later
it doesnt get much easier than thatzip drives are seing the end of their days
i would suggest looking at the zip cds and the cdrw if youre considering purchasing a zip drivei use my palm v as an address book calendar and todo list with a few digital notes
i also have the dooney amp bourke palm v case and the palm travel kitthe palm v is sleek and attractive but has a few major flaws the on button is not protected from being constantly activated by the case causing the batteries to drain extremely fast
the flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient
everybody that i know that has a palm bought an additional case
the original case should at least be usable
the reset button does not clear memory forcing me to wait for the batteries to die to clear it
no bulk delete option is provided
there is no usb option provided with the basic palm for synching with usb devices
the rechargeable builtin battery is nice if you dont leave your cradle for more than a week but nasty if you travelin short the palm v has potential but some simple design flaws and the need to buy a number of addons just to make it functional are simply unacceptable at that price tagfor my needs im going to the rex  it is far less expensive much more portable and provides both usb and pcmcia synching out of the boxi have used a family members vx extensively and compared it to my clie s and cannot find anything redeemable about this model
moreover the stylus slot is very easy to slip out with little to any contact and this was not caused by overuse
i understand it is a few years old at least since the original v and it is very thin but other then that there is not much to thisthe backlight is very straining on the eyes and makes the cool indiglo color of the clie look heavenly
the screen is not very sharp but it is slightly larger then the s which is a plusno expansion slots and  it is hard to recommend such a product thats mb will be used and youll be left wanting something with an expansion slot like an m series or any clie modelthis appears to be a last ditch attempt to make money off of an inferior product
and i am glad the family member that has this was issued it at work and does not own itget a cheaper s with more features or higher end sony model or a palm m insteadskip this digital camera and go directly to the coolpix  by nikon also on amazon
why you ask
well this coolpix is quite old in terms of digital and youll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera
here are the details whymegapixels
the coolpix  takes  megapixel pictures but the  take  megapixel
more pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality
and believe me  you will see the differencezoom
the  has a x optical plus  digital zoom lens however the  has a x optical and the digital zoom
you always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzymemory
both the  and  come with  mb of compactflash but most people would agree that this isnt enough
purchase an additional compactflash card for  mb or more and youll be happy you diddownloading
the  only connects via serial port but the  connects via serial or usb
the usb connection is much much faster for downloading pics to yoru computer but the serial s only method is horrendously slowbatteries
the  uses  aa batteries but the  uses far superior and much longerlasting cr lithium batteries
the s batteries also weigh lessprice
this is the only reason you shoudl consider the   over the  
but lets face it if you have  for the  you should fork over the extra  and get the  so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year
the  is being phased out by nikon
run to the  todayi have owned  or  of these cameras my first one was quite by accident received it in payment for driving for someone
the second one did not do to well this one that i got from amazon works just like it is supposed to work it took me through a  year high school reunion with shining colors
it was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school many things had changed but many were similar or the same
i have many pictures now that i can look at to remind me of my th anniversary of my graduation
thanks amazon you did well
richard l opp thoseoppsyahoocomi was shopping for a stereo cable and had good success with monster cables previously
what i received were two completely separate but colorcoded mono cables  i immediately sent them back for a refund
i expected a joined double cable
amazons photos do not clearly show that the cables are separate nor is there anything in the detailed description about this
i already have too many cables behind my cabinets and on my floor  why would i want two more when one double cable would suffice
conclusion  the photos are misleading and the description is incompletelooks and feels nice but broke after two weeks
i used it for rather high power appliances kw total thoughthe product arrived broken
i could hear parts loose inside so i rma it
it kind of make u wonder what kind of monster product your getting for  dollars u have to be careful when ordering stuff online make sure your not getting chinese replicas
although this product looks like a monster product i highly doubt it wasthis worked for a couple of weeks
now when i plug it into the wall it makes a loud buzzing sound
now i have to deal with their warranty department
ill update this review with that experiencethis is a good enough surge protector
given how much monster knows about multi media setups i wish they had spaced out the sockets a bit more
i seem to have a lot of fat headed plugs adapters for hand drives cable modem etc that really crowd out the sockets
there is a lot of real estate on the unit so i dont know why monster did not space the sockets outreplaced my ancient surge protector with this power strip that acts not only as a surge protector but power conditioner
does it really work
i have no idea
my municipal utility has always delivered high quality power so i have no idea if the power conditioning is adding any value
just a leap of faith on my part
i cant notice any difference in my picture quality
i figure it cant hurt and can only helpi do like the ergonomic features
certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great
no more searching for the right plug
i also like the fact that they provided  widely spaced plugs so wallwarts can fit
those design features are certainly worth a premium over your average power stripupdate   years after purchasing the thing completely died on mei bought the hts as a replacement to the much more expensive hts that started making terrible noises after  years of reliable use
my primary need is to prevent my treadmill from interfering with my computer network
both units have stage  clean power which i assumed meant rf filtering
but while the hts works to filter out the noise from the ac motor in my treadmill the hts does not
it is not clear what type of filtering is needed but the hts does not have it
i also tried the tripplite isobar did not work and monoprice power center which finally workedusing the component input on your tv can make a huge difference in picture quality but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable
save yourself  and buy the cheap onesi bought the mvsvm cable and put it between my pioneer v dvd player and sony wega tv kvfs i was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality color sharpness
same as the result as i used the composite cable came with the box
i really dont know why
i have to say my tv is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even i dont use dvd player
unfortunately my dvd player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video experience
i dont want to say this expensive cable is a poor one i was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance
we just dont have a benchmark to evaluate itthe idea is good but not completely thought out
the broad flat insulation around the wires plays havoc with a normal wire stripper and if you were actually going to use all of the wire there isnt nearly enough wall achors included with it to do the job
being flat it is very awkward and difficult to make a flat  degree turn and the wire twists like a garden hose between anchors instead of laying flat against the wall as it is supposed toif you really want your speaker wire to not be seen then it needs to be run up inside the wall into the attic and across and back down inside the other wall and wired to a speaker terminal
otherwise i think its better to not pay so much and just buy normal speaker wire that can be hidden along the baseboard under the carpet  or behind the floor wall trim and alongside a door frame etcthis cable really isnt that flat  its about  to  mm th inch thick and mm  in wide
the thickness dimension at the monster site is wrong
not really enough thinner than regular wire and not spaceefficient see belowit may be best for running along baseboards etc
its a little too thick to run under most carpets or to paint and have it actually disappearmonster doesnt like to tell you the gauge of cables but these are  awg
which is just fine for up to about  feet maybe more
google speaker wire for some discussion on what size wire you need for a given distance from the receiver to the speakerthe design could be improved maybe thats why these are sharply discounted lots of places
as noted they arent at all superflat
theres a chunk of plastic down the center that seems unnecessary  maybe its there to provide a place to attach nail screw staple but its just taking up space that could have been used to make the wire flatter insteadif youre willing to pay a lot more about foot you can get truly flat speaker wire
but since this cable is available for a fraction of list if you look around it might suit your needs for a specific installationthe color is an offwhite with a slightly yellowish tinge
sort of a cream colorbut  and heres another design flaw  one wire is marked on one side with a silver line with superflat mini and a bunch of other text every foot
its much more than is needed to mark the polarity of the wire to make sure you connect  to  and  to  on the speakers
so it means that only the unmarked side of the wire is really usable  a  flat turn on a surface flips the text out onto the exposed side of the wire  unless you plan to paint thisthe sflm gp package includes  redblack pairs of straight termination pins crimp to attach
they dont seem designed for this wider wire though  theyre really meant for standard round wire
there are also  clamps to hold the wire to the wall and  corner trim pieces for making a  turn by folding over the wire and putting it into the trim
not enough clamps for a whole run if you use them but might be handyfile this under products that could be a lot betterwhen very little seperates one product from another one must ultimately judge that product on minute detalis
and heres my gripe
petty as it may sound the labels keep peeling up
at first its a minor annoyance but when the things get stuck in the player because of the label thats just silly
ive actually gone to the length of using labels from other mini discs
it all sounds stupid yes
but why pay money for something that displeases you
i switched to tdk and theyre a better value and the labels stay putin my first review a failed to mention what systems and software i was running
i believe this may be the cause of many peoples woesi run these cards on  very different systems  amd athlon ghz biostar mb  intel p micron who knows what kind of mb  intel p gateway ditto on the mbbut for all three i am running windows se second editioni believe the determining factor in getting your pcs to talk to each other using this device and provided drivers is having the same operating system on each platformas i recall during software installation for the netgear cards i was required to insert the windows installation cd for the complete software installation
as the netgear software relies on windows networking software this is key to getting these things working
there are a lot of differences between windows windows and windowsme especially in the area of networkingnetgears installation should overcome these differences or at least document the problems
for this i am downgrading my rating to only  starsthey dont last half as long for me as they are advertised which is all i can say
i have used them in digital cameras and dslr camera equipmentthis is a nice unit and it is interesting to read the glowing reviews of customers who have owned the garmin emap for two or three weeks
i have owned the unit for over a year
it works well in the us
it will not guide you street by street to a location but it will guide you quotas the crow flysquot you get a straight line between you and the destination
it worksit does not work well in europe
i purchased the uk and french cds
i installed them on the memory card and used them in england wales and all over france
the first problem is that the garmin emap just doesnt pick up or hold on to the gps satellites in europe very well
it may be that they are too far south or that the antenna is designed for use in us latitudes
i have no explanation but if you intend to use this in europe look for another unitthe second problem is that even after loading the uk and french metroguides when you press the find button you get a list of us cities
i disabled the us city maps and i still got the list of us cities
you cannot quotfindquot and navigate to a foreign city
the only way to navigate is to know where the city is then scroll to it on the tiny emap screen and click on it
if you dont know where the city or tiny welsh village is then you are completely out of luck
very frustrating either way
again if you are travelling out of the us you should steer clear of the emapmy other problem is with garmins service
i could not get my emap to communicate with my laptop
it communicated with three different workstations but not my dell laptop
garmin tech support insisted that there was obviously something wrong with my laptop
i even read them the error messages from the mapsource program which cited program line numbers with errors in them
they insisted that the problem was my laptop not their software
i own my own software company so i know a software problem from a hardward problem
my modem and palmpilot work on the laptop but the garmin does not
garmins support staff refused to help or even acknowledge that there was a problem
they refused to bring the problem up with a senior support person or a programmer
i got the same answer no matter how many times i called and no matter who i spoke with
a year went by and i got along by using a workstation
recently garmin made an update available for their mapsource program that fixed a communications bug with some laptops
i downloaded it and magically my laptop started communicating with the emapif you never need customer support and you wont travel out of the us then the emap is a product you should seriously consideri purchased a yellow garmin etrex gps about a year ago
my main reason for buying it was because i learned about the sport called geocaching and knowing little about these devices at that point i purchased one on the advice of a couple of friends
i used it heavily for for about  months before coming to some conclusions about this devices capabilitiesi will first list the yellow etrexs good points its cheap one of the cheapest gps receivers you can find its easy to find you can buy one at target or at most any sporting goods store its durable
you can drop it several times or dunk it in water and itll still work dry it out first before you attempt to use it again it has an interface to hook up to your computer to download new firmware and to download geocaching waypoints if you have the need for this its easy to use and very intuitive for first timersnow its drawbacks
realize that i am rating this device from the viewpoint of a geocacher and were probably the most demanding users of gps receivers out there it is not an accurate device if youre attempting to get a definitive lock on a waypoint within  of your goal
once in the general search area the signal will likely bounce around and give you wildly varying readings
for example if youve entered a waypoint and get within  of your search area expect to find readings bouncing around from  feet with each step you take
i used this unit in varying terrain under varying treebush cover under varying weathercloud conditions and in varying temperatures with the same results
i was able to obtain two other samples of this receiver and those tests came up with the same results so i surmise that my etrex wasnt just an errant sample of these receivers
upgrading the receivers firmware did nothing to help the accuracygranted my experiences with this receiver probably wont matter that much to most of those who will purchase this unit for tasks such as finding your way around while camping hunting and hiking
for those uses this unit will work just fine
however if youre a geocacher and want a gps unit that will pinpoint your goal effectively without bouncing your readings from  ft as soon as you walk two steps any direction you will want a gps unit that has waas capabilities wide area augmentation system
i now have a gps receiver that has waas and it provides a much more stable lock when in the area of my intended goalin short i found this unit to be frustrating to use for geocaching
there are other gps units that will provide more stable signallock than the garmin etrex for close to the same pricei bought one of these units because of its waterproof rating
that is  minutes at  feet
forget that one
the battery compartment isnt rated for thisso it leaks big time
i called garmin about this and they said that nothing can be done
there is no fix
this was december   since it eats batteries i bought a radio shack digital camera battery kit
it has  nimh batteries rated at mah and a chargerfor 
this unit worked very well
since the batteries compartment isnt waterproof the batteries got wet
i was in sea water and these batteries got ruined
if you plan on buying this gps and using it around water i would be careful in not using expensive batteries in it
windsurfing kayaking canoeing white water rafting and the rest be careful
if you buy their super expensive cable you can update your unit free from their web site
they do offer great upgrades for their products free
wow
i only give the unit  stars
i own three of their products and this is the worse one for not living up to what they say it will do
the best one out there for tuff service  is the gps  versioni used this mb sandisk cf card with my nikon  digital camera on a recent trip to vietnam
while it does store plenty of high quality images the issue i have with this card is the readwrite rate
as the card fills up with pictures it becomes slow to store the picture you just took
i estimate that this took up to  seconds an eternity while waiting to take another picture
even more painful is reviewing and deleting pictures
going through thumbnails of about  pictures took  minutes as the camera struggled to read from the memory card
i also took along a lexar mb x card that displayed my pictures almost instantaneously
this is a lower capacity card but it gave me a comparison
sandisk doesnt do a very good job of stating its readwrite speeds
these speedsalong with  of mbs is what distinguishes mainstream from professional quality cards
professional photographers dont have time to wait to take another picture or review their older pictures
i am buying a large capacity lexar x card to be my primary high storage card and the sandisk card will be my backup for overflow situationswhen you can get the signal they sound good
but as you move around the house they constantly lose the signal and you find you have to constantly tune in
and there are only two weak signal possitions on the dial on either the a and b channel
not only that but the batteries die out quickly
my dad who bought these headphones to listen to the tv and cds because hes nearly deaf and subsequently doesnt hear the high pitched hum in the background because of high tone nerve loss is going through batteries like water
maybe some people can buy batteries at this rate but not him
not only that but the tuning wheel is so close to where you can get a hold of them to succesfully take them off that its hard not to grab them by the tuning wheel when taking them off
which as you can guess screws up the tuning everytime
if only there were handles on each ear cup for easy removal
were sending these back and looking into the more expensive rechargable ones from a company that specializes in hearing loss technologyi have had this drive for about  days now and the performance seems quite reliable
however two things bother me about this drive the noise
i have a brand new dell dimension  that is a very quiet machine
i am adding this drive as a second volume and there is an annoying reverberating noise from the disk even when its not accessing
its not an outright loud noise but persistent enough that after  minutes it quotfeelsquot very loud
im thinking of giving them a second chance and return this for a replacement
the quality of the enclosed ide cable is deplorable
the instructions in the package suggested using that cable to quotmaximize performancequot looking at the substandard cable i thought of leaving the original dell cable in there
when the sound kept disturbing me i decided to give the maxtor cable a try for what it was worth
as expected that didnt have any effect on the noise leveli did find a quirk with windows  in the process that might be helpful to other users
apparently when you switch ide cables wink loses track of the bootable device
switching back to the original cable does not help either
i tried all forms of recovery and repair but to no avail
i had to do a full install to get it up and and running again
this is not a problem with xp home or professional thoughour it vendor ordered this for  me  years ago yes the camera has been out that long makes you think doesnt it when i told him i didnt know anything but i needed a digital camera in a hurryhaving been new to the world of digital cameras at the time i was easily impressed when i opened the package
they advertise the camera as being mac compatible via a serial portwell macs havent shipped with serial ports for years
why not usb
i had to buy a price adapter by belkin about the only one in existance that would connect this camera to my g at the time
the images download slooooooow via a serial port
usb is a much faster architecture
of course firewire is  times faster than usb but since windows hasnt caught up to the technical advances of mac yet usb would have been sufficient for a crossplatform marketwhen youre using olympuss proprietary software to download the images from your camera you cant do anything else it does not function in the background
very sloppy programming no need for such a simple process to take up so much of the system heapthe camera uses  four aa batteries which add to the weight of the camera significantly
if you use the led screen in the back of the camera prepare to carry an additional  aa batteries with you for a daylong shoot because youre going to be changing batteries at least  times in order to shoot a single day on a vacation this camera eats batteries for breakfastthis also  applies if you use the flash
there is very little warning that the batteries are low when there is almost no juice left a pitiful battery icon will flash briefly in the view finder and then thats it
this camera does not use rechargable batteriesabout  months after owning this camera i started noticing a delay in response time
id click on the shutter release and a full second and a half would pass before the picture would be taken
this is too much of a delay
the picture should take immediately just like it does on a  brownie hawkeye
if im trying to shoot an action shot or an animal or a child every split second matters when i click the picture should be taken immediately not a week later
fresh batteries dont make a difference in the delaythe camera does take some halfway decent x jpeg shots but the camera is slow in writing them to disk which means you cant take the photos quickly in succession
you also cant delete a bad shot on the camera so even if a shot is awful youre stuck with it until you load the disk into the computer to delete the shot which means you have to wait for the entire roll of shots to load into the program and download in order to even delete themthere are some great bargains to be had in the computer world this is not the case with digital cameras
you truly get what you pay for
after being exposed to some very nice digital still cameras and digital camcorders i can confidently say that this little olympus is one of the worst ive ever used and should definitely be a last choice for anyone using a macintoshthe player plays only plays dvds and cdsno cdr no cdrw no mp
purports to play vcd but this is pointless since it cant play cdrmost frustrating part of this unit is the time lag between power on and tray opening
should take one second but wastes about tenremote control is poorly designed and youll be forced to turn on the lights to find any button
multiple angle dvds are very frustrating to use
changing angles requires more than one button pushmy apex cost half as much and has many more featuresi ordered a rd unit to replace one of two that had crashed non stop scanning for a dvd until it got to nd machine
i figured the st unit crashing was a flukeso  months after getting the rd unit guess what  non stop dvd scanningcause is an obviously piss poor spindle motor being asked to be the center of a dvd jukeboxhow do i know this well open the darn thing up and give that little motor a bit of persuasion and presto it works and will do so for a couple hours until it sticks againcurrently have a spindle motor on order for the first  from pioneer plus whatever time it takes me to swap it out
  will try and see if the one year parts from pioneer takes care of the lastwhy these machines have such a inadequate spin motor is beyond me
just be warned since this motor seems to be used on the bulk of their dvd productsother than that i love that i can have up to  dvds stored and playable at the press of a button
i just want better reliability out of them
 follow up after shipping and everything new spin motor was 
it is a bit technical to install so if you have never done anything like it suggest repair shop or someone that has
tools needed  solder iron  jewelers phillips  phillips small needle nose magnet or fingers for screw drivers paper and pencil clean place to work is a must alsoto get to motorremove cover the entrire circuitry board sitting on top rear of machine   screws  the upper portion of the disc tray  screws armature that pushed dvd into place and finally the assebmy that contains motor and disc readto pull circuit board assembly most connections are simple push in hardened circuit runs
there are also  connections with grey wire running to them that only require the upper portion of the white connectors be pulled up a bit so that the wire pulls from them
remember all these connections and how they run especially with the motor as they will bind up the system if you run them wrongto get to motor there is one screw that has to be removed on the motor assembly along with a spring
next there are  blue rubber shock absorbers that can be unseated with the  phillips by gently poking them out
finally just press back a tab that holds assemble in plastic mount and pull it outyou will have to look through spindle to see the  screws that attach motor to the assembly they are itty bitty things so becareful
last desolder old connections red and black wire and reassemble in reverse order making sure everything is free to move correctly
there is one circuit run that if not put in properly will cause the assmebly to not beable to read your disc as it will bind system up so carfully make sure it is free to slide back and forth without binding after you reassemble it and before putting the housing back into systemgive it a good look over before firing it up and use a single disc to check it out
i had to pull cover back off as i had no remote or out put darn a pair of feeds that got pushed under circuit cardeverything back together and machine is working like new again yeah just hope this replacement motor lasts longer than the original now  title says it all
with so many folks either recording their own play lists and downloading their music any player without the capability to play them is obsoletei read all the raving reviews and thought this would be a slamdunk but no soi had the sony cdpcx which i had for  years
i always loved it and it always worked flawlessly
it started to develop some squeaking noises during cd loading so i tried to repair it and broke it while doing sohere are the shortcommings which made me decide to return the item
they might not seem like a big deal but having used those features for  years i would really miss them the single biggest complain i have is that you cant scroll through your cds to see which cd to select even if the cds have cd text
how am i suppossed to find a cd
the sony has multiple functions for that
eg
if you scroll through the cds even if one is playing it shows the full cd text or the title you entered with the keyboard for every cd
that allows you to easily find a cd
you can also scan alphabetically scan by artist and so on
all this is missing from this cd player
that makes is unusable
if i am missing something then please comment and let me know i double that i will change my mind about this player though one small feature but one i used a lot is the delete option
the sony allows you to delete tracks on a cd
that is a great feature
if you buy a cd and you only like half the tracks or it turns out it is one of those cds where only  tracks are good then you can just delete a track and it will never play that track ever again normal or random mode the unit does not show the cd text for the track
again maybe im missing something here but the sony does first scroll through the entire cd title and then always shows the track that is playing
the pioneer just shows the track number
what the heck the cd title with cd text is only  characters long it does scroll
 characters
that reminds me of  dosfilesystem
come on it is  after all no keyboard hookup
ok so i already knew that i had to do a compromise and copy all my  cds on my computer to get cd text
but im not so sure if i really want to do this
it is nice with the sony that you can just enter the titles directly at the cd changer sound
not quite sure but i think my sony sounded better
but maybe now im just being totally biased
anyway the cd changer does not sound that great and im using optical out into an expensive receiver cost
the pioneer costs  more  more then the sony cd changer
for what
less featuresthis will be the first item i am going to return to amazon
i never bothered returning anything but there is no way i stick with this cd changerthe sony still has some short commings i really thought that today they would have a cd player which you could hook up with eithernet and update the cd titles or so
but i guess in todays mp world there is no incentive for these companies to invest in old school cd technology
bummeri recently got both versions of this device
after using them for  months or so i think its time to tell about my experiences
first you should know that the mg version sounds much better and also seems to have a much better radio tuner which is suitable for mobile use
the ordinary nomad  has a more useful display but the sound really sucks
overtuning and cracks during radio playback are a steady companion
on contrary the mg nomad  sounds remarkably better actually as good as it looks and the finish of the hardware is top quality comparable with sony standarts on mobile devices
but beware handling is a real mess
it will make you crazy accidentially pressing various buttoms on the mg if you are about to choose take the much more expensive nomad  mg at least it sounds good and is the best visual design availlable on the market
the ordinary nomad  is a  disappointment and a shame for creatives hardware line upi have this tripod for just  months
i have used about  times
the head has come apart from the center post
it appears the head screwed into the center post and the grooves have stripped
it is going to cost me shipping plus an additional  to send it back for repair or replacementadditionally the tripod is steady if you use the hook at the bottom to hang your camera or gadget bag but make sure you tighten down the screw that holds the center post or it will wobble on youi realize its an inexpensive cheap tripod but just because it doesnt cost much doesnt mean it has to be made poorly
buy it at your own riski prefer the logitech optical mouse i use at work
logitech is lighter and feel betterthis is very good for kids but the adjustable viewing side came our within a month because of poor adhesive qualitybought these bushnells for general usagethough very inexpensive i expected alot moreimage is not clear or sharp to say the leastblurry is a better term to usehate to write negative reviews but these are going back asap and i will spend a little more and hope for something bettermaybe i got a bad pair or returned ones or somethingnot recommended in the leastwithin days of receiving this product the rubber around the eye piece fell off
not a big deal but annoying nonetheless
the quality of the optics of the binoculars leaves much to be desired but of course that is a function of the price
in humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up
the lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses making them almost useless
i just left them somewhere when i was traveling
on the plus side they are small light and convenient to carry around
would not buy again even though they are inexpensive it just isnt worth the  that i spent on it
if casual birding in your backyard is all you will be doing with these this is the product for you
otherwise dont botherthe eyecups were too short for my eyes so you have to hold it away from your eyes and balance it in the air to see through it cheap but in the end not usable for mei ordered two of these to keep in the car
one of them had to be returned as it was out of alignment and resulted in vertical double vision
not very good quality control
the one that worked was fine but i gave them two stars to call attention to the bad one and warn customers to check them carefully on arrivalon the positive these are great as compacts that fit inside your cars glove box or in your pocket
on the downside the optical quality and stability is poor
but then for the price you get what you pay for especially with binocularsa note if you do buy them
one of my rubber endcaps fell off somewhere in the woods
these rubber endcaps are just slipons so you will need to put a drop of rubber cement on them to be secureoverall for the price and easy of storing they are great  stars but for the optical performance   stars
there are better binoculars for a little more mula
conditionally recommendedthese are very poor binoculars
the optics are very low contrast no very sharp very difficult to focus flare easily
the focus wheel has lots of slack and feels junky
the eye pieces have very little tolerance frustrating to use
pay a little more and get something you will enjoyim giving these binoculars two stars because the price is so low
its hard to complain about  dollar binoculars  but i will anywaythe glass is very foggy
it feels like im looking through plastic toy binoculars
after spending  minutes with these my eyes feel tired and strainedalso the quality is so poor that they wont stay focused
the dial that allows you to focus the right eye is very loose and requires constant adjustmentyes they were cheap  but what is the point if you can hardly use themone of the lens was out of line with the other side  also had a smudge or something on it that i couldnt get to come off
returned themi liked these binoculars so much i purchased a second pair
unfortunatley the updated version is not nearly as nice as the pair i received about  years ago
the older version is shown in the rd image  i notified amazon so they may remove it by the time you read thisthe old version has a nice rubber coating focuses much better easier to use focusing wheel folds down smaller easier to hold with fingers round vs larger flat top sectionmy old version is also much clearer but i have a feeling i may just have a bad copy
its a little blurry even after focusing
the old pair is crystal clearim very disappointed in this new version
im looking for the old version online but theres a chance sellers are using the old photo and selling the new versionordered these binoculars intending to use them when hiking or trail riding wanted something small and compact
they are small about  in length   wide when folded and they are lite weight
but the quality of view was terrible
it might be ok for sitting on the porch looking at a bird in the back yard providing you have pretty steady hands but thats about all
i immediately returned them to amazon and they are very good about that
i just wished i had thought about what to expect for  binocularsyou get what you pay for  they are cheap
lo quality glass and dont focus very well
i was unable to use them for my intended purpose but i asked too much of them low light situation
handed them off to my kidi bought two for a vacation in alaska last summer
they seemed perfect for what i was wanting according to the description and published specs
but they saw very little service because of the difficulty finding the target keeping it steady and focusing
focusing was extremely hard
we could not use them at all and we both tried
a more expensive and higher quality binocular may have worked
even an inexpensive x would have been okay for what i wanted
bushnell makes good stuff but this x binocular did not work for usthat sounds like pride
insulting to all americans
put a flag on it
thatll fool them dumb americans
so proud they couldnt invest in this country
they are fine for ten bucks but what a disgusting company
look at a more honest dealer
gross
step up bushnell what are you proud of
proud of your chinese built things orbought this for hiking
i thought of not spending a lot of money but in the end i had to buy a more expensive binocularthese are not bad optically
however they are extremely cheaply build
mine was broken on arrival
on first use i was able to pull out one eyepiece which included one lens element
this was definitely not by design
it seems eyepiece thread was not there or broken
no force was needed to pull out the eyepieceamazon was good at handling the return but i decided not to try my luck with another
i just bought olympus roamer x
three times the money but i would say three times the build qualityi know they were only  but they are poor quality
its very hard to get a clear picture with both eyes open
put the  towards a better set of binoculars and dont bother with thesethis are great to give to your kids and thats pretty much it
i ordered one pair of these and one pair of the tasco binoculars of the same size
the tascos are betterin fact the first pair of these i ordered i had to send back because the collimation was completely off
so bad that even with adjustment they couldnt be fixedso the new pair came in today and they have problems but ill keep them
the focal points of the lenses varythat is the bottom of the scene will be in focus while the top wont be
i have to constantly refocus and only the exact center of the view is in focus at any one timeif you must go with binoculars this cheap go with the tascos the ones i got at least were much clearer and betterthe real problem with these ultra cheap binoculars is their lack of quality control and their lack of durability
i would suggest you throw these in the back of your truck as beaters but they simply will not stand up to any bouncing dropping or banging around
the plastic parts barely fit together and work as is any rough treatment will render them uselessbinocularsunless used as toysare precision instruments
there is unfortunately no way to make them cheaply and still have them serve the function for which they were intended
these bushnells are fine for the most basic of tasks but they are not pleasurable nor rewarding to usevery convenient to use nice focusing rubber eye cups but you get what you pay for
binocular users dont usually realize what theyre missing until they check out nikon or minolta binocs
the images focus into crystal clarity but the price is close to a hundred or more bucks
but its like a digital camera
it doesnt matter what the features are if the images are crappythe lenses in these binocs have rings around the inner perimeter that are always out of focus
the center image is pretty good until you compare it with better binoculars then there are more colors a brighter image and of course consequently greater viewing pleasurealso like most lens caps on binoculars the lens caps on these should be discarded with the plastic wrap and box
they fall off with gravity and youll soon lose them anywaythis ones a good model for kids
for yourself use your tax cut and buy a more expensive model
if youre going to walk  miles into the woods you deserve to have primo opticsi bought a pair through amazon warehouse deals that were in like new condition
i could tell that right off the bat the optics were poor
there was a double image produced and no level of correcting fixed the situation
i have a small portable pair of  x  binoculars
i was hoping the additional light i would get through the larger lenses and the extra x would make a difference
but i did not experience that
i noticed that they did not get me any additional closeness that you would expect and any light gains were minimal at best
they are not bad but size wise you might be justified sticking with a  x  or going with a  x  because you wont notice the gainsi have the powerview x model
they are difficult to hold steady and difficult keep focused
the powerview x model has  more magnification so i assume its  more difficult to hold them steady and  more difficult to keep them focused
the zip focus is a handy feature
youll need it
i find myself refocusing the xs all the time
for the same price i think a good pair of xs would be easier to use and provide better image qualityme sighs  finally i got good interwebz again
having two computers and a neighbor with shoddy wifi i could only get a good connection on one computer
i got tired of this so i ordered this with which i have had great experience in the past previously owning about  of these
i use a lot of bittorrent traffic downloading and uploading different nix distros and other foss and cc files and every other router ive ever tried crapped out on me after about  minutes of bt traffic
the befsr is my personal favorite and am glad to have gotten it at a decent price here
i definitely recommend this router
i got this one refurbished and theres nothing wrong with it at all save for some minor issues setting it up
upnp port forwarding is one of its features im glad to have utorrent showed all green for connections
i have not noticed any drop in network speed like with a few other routers
easy install good features reliable performance durable case nicelooking case overall a in my bookedit  okay im sad to say that ive gotta change my review here to one of negativity
i have been suffering from a broken gui within the router at 
the router does not accept upnp even though ive managed to set it to accept upnp
when i fire up utorrent my mirc connection drops and my web connection drops to about kbps dl speed  after much frustration and even a firmware upgrade i have decided to give up on trying to make it work
soon as i save up some money ill be buying a brandnew router and will likely hang this router in front of my archery targetthe only reason im still giving the router  stars instead of  is first the one i have is refurbished and the nib ones i owned in the past didnt suffer these problems and second because my problems might be isolated to just my router not all refurbsas others have reported quality is disappointing
thought it was a good router at a decent price until it started breaking down regularly shows red diagnostic lightlinksys website indicates that company knows about the problem and will replace only if within warranty period
technically within their rights but seems unethical to me  they sold a defective product and arent taking the responsibility for itrecommend you avoid this and be careful about other linksys products weeks after the  year warranty expired on my befsr version the product went into an irrecoverable state in which the wan port wasnt active the web gui wasnt reachable by lan port and the red diag light just stayed lit up even after resets as instructed by support from linksys
the solution ends up being the need to purchase another cabledsl router
the dlink dip will hopefully have a longer life it already has better features and a better priceapart from the failure the linksys is good although missing a print server portthis router seems to have problems creating connections
as long as a computer stays up and connected everything seems ok however upon computer reboot it may take several tries to obtain a connection from this router
tried updating the firmware since the firmware was outofdate but because of bad documentation and a clunky update method the router was temporarily bricked
thank gawd others with the same router posted remedies online see
the process bit other folks too and after a very painful halfday of work the router was back
original problem was not fixed howeverweekly disconnects which tech support wasnt able to solve
finally it wouldnt connect at all
after spending the better part of a day with the live chat support very helpful btw it was concluded that the unit was defective and needs to be replaced
as this is my nd unit i wont be buying linksys againim tired of this quality
i dont even remember owning this it lasted so shortits a crap shoot how long theyll last
 years
 year
 moslinksys products have been degrading in quality over some time
this product is no exception
i have had to rma several of these items over the last year
linksys support is outsourced meaning poor communication
also the support department is no longer about providing support but will instead try to throw roadblocks in your path to keep you from replacing your defective product
expect several calls and at least a week to replace a defective product through linksys if you have never had to run their gauntlet beforeyes this router is easy to use setup and does exactly what you would expect
however its disposable
expect to buy another one within a  years
after just over  years mine died it only came with a  year warrenty
while it still works i have to reset it by unplugging it and then plugging it back in several times a day like 
then you have to wait about a minute for all the computers to deal with the reset
this sort of disposable lifespan seems pretty par for the course for linksys consumer productsi was gullible enough to replace my first with a second like i said they are cheap and cheap
the second has lasted longer but every time the house power goes out i have to reset the router using linksys netset utility which means physically connecting a computer directly to the router  which is a pain for me since i keep it in a closet next to my patch panel
netset works fine except it is windows only
so linksys are not mac friendly though macs will work with their productsso this is my last linksys product
i replace my linksys wireless ap with an apple airport extreme  much more stableso in short with linksys  you get what you pay for  they are cheap and cheapive owned this product for a few years now and it recently just died  the ethernet switch portion is completely dead which means no computer using ethernet can be attached to it although the wan connection still works which still renders it uselessperhaps my negative impressions are mostly due to me being an early adopter of this product
i found the docutmentation to be poorly written and some features halfimplemented the firewallinternet security portion of the product
i use a mac and the firmware upgrades only work using a pc since i use virtual pc i was able to perform updates
i paid nearly  for the product but now it costs a lot less
so is  a good deal for  years of performance
im not so suretwo reasons i bought this  to move all my computers behind a router so i wouldnt have to leave one on all the time and  to be able to handle inbound ftp connections to my ftp server
the router functioned acceptably for basic functions easy to configure etc
 but inbound ftp connections would consistently fail after transfering a few thousand bytes
each failure would require that the router be resetthis item is probably ok for most people but it couldnt handle the one primary thing that i needed hence the low rating
its now running as a replacement for my old hub also a linksys which has an overheating problem
youd think id learnive owned several of these routers for many years
ive upgraded and downgraded firmware trying to find something that was really solid and reliable
ive come to the conclusion this unit is good for a small noncritical network but it has reliability issuessince cisco took over linksys the longterm stability and reliability of their products has diminished in my opinion
this router works well but it will occasionally freeze up for no reason and require a hard resetpower cycle to work again
also this unit will sometimes reset and reload factory default information with no notice
if you change the default admin password you may find it reset back to the default
sometimes it will just lockout and you have to do a hard reset pressing the reset button while powering up to reload factory defaults
this router should not be used in any environment where it would be left unattended for long periods of time
it simply is not reliable in that capacityif you have a dsl modem i would think twice about getting this router
it works fine for intranet communications but it is constantly dropping the connection with the dsl modem
often when it does try to reconnect it will say the lcp negotiation has failed whatever that means and there is not sufficient documentation that explains why this problem occurs
after all if you are buying this router you should always have your connection on and not have to worry about the lcp negotiation
it doesnt quotjust workquot  something i supposed i have gotten to used to using macsi bought this product and after setting it up and configuring a linksys card just over  hours later it worked beautifully that is until a few days ago
it started freezing up and then yesterday i returned to find a router that does not worki have now spent  hours and talked to  expert techs that have no idea how to fix this problem
most of the quotexpertsquot are less skilled in computer networking than i am and i am a film director
additionally the software does not fire correctly and once on the wrong path is not recoverabletherefore i would be very weary of jumping in
when it works it is beautiful but when it crashes you are abandoned and without support or help  make your decisionvery easy to setup and once setup pretty much maintenace free
you have heard all that butmy first router quited after  months and  weeks
the connection was intermittent
took a weekend to isolate and identify the source of the problem
its the routers not the cable modem the isp network the network cards the oss or the computers connecting to the router
customer support is so so
gone thru the diagnostic routines quite a few times before support admited that the router was bad
took three to four weeks and many emailsphone calls to get a replacement
replacement was a doa
took another  weeks to replace the replacement
make you wonder its reliability
with the life cycle expectancy of the router in mind i am shopping for a replacement
and it is not going to be a linksysgood product responsive customer service representatives but this router needs resetting almost every day
it just stops working without evident reason
i upgraded the firmware with the latest version without results
the problem might be somwhere else but it is not to my best knowledge and the employees from linksys could not give me a satisfactory anser to that problem after several calls of mine either
maybe it will work better with a different setup but is this normal
maybe it needs a newer firmware
i dont recommend this product anywayi returned this item because i could not get it to work with my computer
however to be a refurbished item it looked practically new
no problem returning iti bought both the linksys and belkin port kvm products
on the linksys i had problems with mice being recognized and having mouse clicks missed
on bootup i could not have my laptop attached if it was not on port  since it would then think the mouse was not attached no matter what mouse or trackball i usedi have none of these problems with the belkin product
also from an ergonomic point of view the belkinproduct is set up much better with the cables all attaching from the back except the console mousekeyboard cables
also the belkin product is less expensiveobviously i would suggest forgetting the linksys and buying the belkin kvmsure the technical merits of good graphics etc are a plus but do not garner the poorly thought out product  stars
after using kvms for years i have never had the problems like i have had with this
other manufacturers manage to use ctrl keys for their hotkey functions without the problems that this box plagues you withwhile this box may have garnered rave reviews from the folks who want to play linux etc i have to say to use this on a primary production machine will eventually drive you nuts
if you are always using constant ctrl or shift operations to mass select items you will constantly find that your key press was not registered
in addition sometimes your mouse will just freeze until you click a button againoh well the same goes for all linksys products they are a bit cheaper than what you would normally pay but you get what you pay for
suitable for home or dorm but not for an all day production machinewell ive owned this one for a few years now and my eardrums have never really enjoyed it
i even have a headphone amp and took the earpads off to try and modify how it sounds
it really is too muddy sounding for my tastes
i dont understand why some people have reviewed it as having to much treble
i cant hardly hear any high frequencies and it only sounds somewhat decent if i use an equalizer
i do have to say though it is the most comfortable headphones i have ever owned
it is a joy to be able to wear this for hours on end with out a break
although it has been built with mostly plastic it doesnt creak like some very cheap headphones do
too bad it just doesnt sound very good
the bass for me sounds ok but the mids and highs sound dead
even all my cheap sony headphones sound much betterfor the sound i would give  stars but for the comfort of wearing them id give a  because sound is more important for me i gave  stars overall
im not sure if you can even buy this model anymorei have since moved on to grado headphones and the sound from them is much much more pleasingi am giving this product a  to balance the scales
first i will say what i like about it then the bad stuff
  the good msoft and hp are almost there this is much more palmesque than their last try
you can choose to  use an application manager that feels just like the palms and you can  even beam contacts crossplatform to a palm
also you can get a special  ethernet card for the  to plug it in to a lan for all your networking  desires
though i havent done this yetbut dont be fooled by some of  the reviews below many of these people work for hp and microsoft trust  me i just know this and are using the reviews to generate positive spin  on this product
the  is still definitely slower than the palm and  definitely much bigger than the palm v
also check any pda shareware  site there are so many more free or cheap programs for the palm so for  the people who wrote that their palm couldnt quotdo enoughquot they  must not have even triedif youre looking for an mp player do you  really want one that shares your pdas operating system
the mp player  software uses almost all of the processors capacity just to play music
also the color is really nice looking inside but harder to see in bright  light
i guess the bottom line is also the bottom line  competitively i  see this as palms equal but financially youll be taking a bigger hit
eventually when someone like gotype makes an external keyboard for the   it could be a decent surrogate laptopskip this one and get either kodak royal gold  or fuji superia   if you settle for this film you are going to possibly compromise your photo shoti got a pack of screen protectors and tried to install the first one
after several attempts i found out how they should fit on my jornada
i think hp at least should had spend some time writting a one page well done installation manualnow that i installed the first screen protector i used my jornada for two weeks
what i got
an scratched screen protector
now i feel like buying a protector for my screen protectori used to have a palm v protected with writeright protector stickers and i got used to them
i hope hp brings up something like this or wait until fellowes get to this market offering its expensive but high quality productsif somebody find something better to protect your jornada please let me knowive owned the rio  and i liked it
if you must own a rio get a  atleast you can use smart media cards
its bad enough that the  uses a rio only method for expanding storage but the design of such is bad
they had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery
the pins are very easily bent or broken when reloading batteries or upgrading the back panel
the device is physically larger than it should be and it is made of the worst plastic possible
a soft compound that would not be durable
overall bad product
please shop around
and check out reviews
diamond gets what they deserve for letting this peice of junk make it all the way to marketive had the philips cdr for about a year now
i love the ability to  record cds but i think maybe i should have shopped around for a better  productmy biggest complaint with philips is that their support is  awful
they have idoits with no training answering the phones
you can  actually hear them reading through the same notes you can find on the web
call with a complex problem and they ask dumb questions like quotare your  cables plugged inquotmy second complaint is that with fast dubbing  the deck adds a half second of blank time between tracks
therefore dont  bother copying a continuous play cd
they sound really badi bought this cause i needed something fast and didnt want to spend a lot of money
the unit ok ok  it eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best
i should have ponied up the cash for a better cameraunfortunately it is not just the sound that one must use to judge a headphone
the construction is very important
why
because you inevitably throw them around in various ways
you cannot be careful all the time
and you may not be the only one who uses the headphone
they inevitably fall down or the cleaning lady does something
this headphone has one of the most fragile holder pieces for the earpieces that i have seen
look closely at the construction and notice the plastic u shaped holder that actually holds the ear piece
it is very fragile
if you break the holder you can try super glue to repair but that tends to be temporary
other fine headphones use metal or grado has an alternative design
when my holder piece broke the company charged me  to repair this vital item which is so fragile and which does not lend itself to easy repair
that is why i rate the headphone down
the basic design has not changed in many years and it surely needs to be upgraded
perhaps with a poor review the company will get the messagethis is my first disappointment from dlink
ive come to rely on their  switches hubs and nics for my home network
i decided to add the di  after i got a cable modem installedphysical setup of the unit is a  snap earning dlink one star
all parts attach as advertised in the  manuals with one caution check the cable from your your cable modem to the  computer despite what the manual said my cable turned out to be a regular  patch cable not a crossover cable
installing the software was also very  simple and setting the configualtions on unit was trouble free therby  earning the di its second starthe only problem encountered was a  major one my system never saw the connection to the internet through the  di
all indications were the unit was functioning perfectly i had  flashing lights indicating traffic between the internet modem and the  di and the di and my hub
i could ping the unit by ip address but  not by name even after adding appropriate entries to the hosts file
no  amount of fiddling with the pcs routing table helped eitherafter  spending four days and trying to connect it to my usual computer on the  network and three other computers in various configurations i gave up and  requested a refund from amazon
ive read other successful reviews so  obviouly it works for some configurations but not others
the one major  difference i noticed between my setup and the suggested directions is i  have my own domain and am using my own dhcp server and not allowing the  di to be the dhcp server
it may be that if you are using a peer  network the di will integrate just fine
if you have a domain setup  the di does not appear to be the correct solutionif it works for  you it is a great solution
if you have a single computer you should try  it
i am now going in search of other hardware firewall solutions to the  internet security problemthis card embarrassed me
i recommended it to a friend with a gigabyte mb and it crashed the machine repeatedly
an obsolete nexxt card delivered the goods
i was puzzled as i had used it successfully on an ibm mb and an asus mb i was looking for a radio thats good on batteries that i can listen to while going to sleepthis one misses that boat because the sound only comes from one earbud
not acceptablebarely picks up any station
stations that i can get with a much smaller radio come in with a lot of static
have tried it numerous locations with the same result
i can get  or  stations usually that are bareble to listen without too much statici dont recommend this product
find something more reliable or spend a little more money on something that will worka thousand versions of mp and ipod type players
numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers
why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile
radio shack built a couple of version some  to  years ago and they were excellent
i have had  or  of them but all have now broken and rs no longer offersthey do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish
could you imagine doing that on your television set with some  hundred channels
this seems such an obvious product instead of the st version of another mp player
there are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walkingthink postmen going to the beach working hiking camping etc
this is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that i can find
again radio shack had such a unit some years agoa couple of modelsi would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at rs decided to no longer offer them
sony has such a unit but you can only listen via an earphonenot thru a speaker
someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eatingmy rating for this product has dropped as ive owned it
the plastic case looks good compared to most lowrent transistor radios these days
be warned however that there is a red diode that lights up to tell you when youve locked on to the full strength signal of a stationthis radio is almost impossible to tune unless you put fresh batteries in it mo more than  days ago
after that it begins to drain the batteries very quickly
one assumes this is because a red diode indicator begins draining the batteries as soon as you put them in
the diode is redundantpointless you dont need it because when a station is tuned correctly the proof is in the audio not some useless light
frequently the red glow is good and strong when the station is not tuned right and a program is flooded with static
and the diode is off completely when you find the stronger signalonce the batteries start draining one week
tou get two results with this radio
 static or  pulsing static which makes listening pretty aggravatingfirst of all this records with a dc bias which is not listed in the description
there is a noticeable difference between ac and dc bias recorders with ac sounding much clearerthis recorder also cuts off all bass sounds completely and turns up the treble
youll be able to hear vocals very well but not the drums or bass guitari would say this recorder is ideal for voice recordings onlyif youre looking for a cassette recorder to copy music from your computer i would recommend the radio shack desktop cassette recorder which records with an ac bias and doesnt completely cut out the bass of songs
it is a bit more expensive thoughamazon was extremely helpful with my return of this item and i promptly got a full refundi should have known by the price
it does work but the loudest sound via headphone is barely adequate
overall i wouldnt recommendworks good
but i found this to be pricey
i found one at walmar that was way cheaper that came with a microphone and a cassette tapeused for less than  months for music and audio on my kindle fire before they snapped in half
no abuse
just spread the pads to put over my head and snap it was all over
no my head is not that largeokay i realize that these are very inexpensive headphones but i had hopes for themi usually just use typical ipod ear buds for regular use and a couple of brands of overtheear headphones for holding in place during running and strenuous workouts
my plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running
i realized that they wouldnt silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier fully paddedinsulated headphones dobut i had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds
i was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since i didnt want to completely tune out what was happening around meit didnt take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction
the inyourear buds cover outside noise better than these do
so i thoughtoh well ill just use them for regular indoor listening
theyre certainly comfortable enough
but they dont stay onor at least they dont stay on me
i have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my earsthe sound clarity is decent for the price
the cable is plenty long at about 
the xbs port is supposed to offer increased bass response
i maybe noticed a bit of difference there but its of little help when the headphones wont stay in place on my earsi dont do well with headphones they irritate my ears
i itch when i use them so if you dont have that problem then order these
for the price your cant go wrong
for the kiddies they are a bit too cheap and wont hold up under the hard useagethe sound leaks like crazy
i originally bought these thinking  the slim profile can help me listen to my ipod while lying down in bed
they are useful if you like the whole world to know what your listening to and they are a step up from cheap united airlines headphones that you get on long distance flightsyes they were light weight but they were not noise canceling and they broke after about a month of regular usei bought my first set of these in june  for 
great price for the sound quality
ten months later for no discernible reason the left earpiece went outok i figured they were only   besides perhaps i did something to cause it unlikely because im gentle with my electronicsso i bought another pair in april of  for  tax this time doncha know
this pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to workif you dont mind replacing these every  months thats my experience anyway these are a great budget pair of headphones they sound good and are comfortable
id prefer to pay double or even triple the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of yearswhy must so many products be designed this way
its bad for the environment and its inconvenient for menot sure what other ppl who wrote a review for these headphones heard
i put them on and listened to jango on my toshiba thrive
sounded like i had cotton in my ears
bass is good no mids at all but the highs sound like they are being clipped
like listening to sound through a fan
i plugged in my older cheapo buds and the sound was  times better
i bought the panasonic headphones mainly to skype
havent tried that yet
will update
but hey what do you want for five bucksas it says in the title they were to small and therefore uncomfortable for a mans size head
they would probably be okay for a kid especially for the pricethey are very quiet
even at the highest volume on my sons leapster explorer it is hard to hear what is going on through these
definitely not worth the few dollars you spend on themi purchased these with a few other sets of headphones and these had the worst sound out of all of them
so muffled
i had read through a ton of the reviews on these and i thought i had a winner but no
dont bother with these
the mid tones and treble sound like there being played under water
blehthese headphones are fine for the money but i would definitely suggest that you spend just a little more and get the koss ktxpro headphones insteadthe koss phones are much more comfortable i cant stress this enough and they also sound better
trust me your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucksi wear the koss phones for hours each day at work and they never hurt
these panasonics hurt after less than an hour
i think its because the face of the phones isnt parallel with my ears so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jawof course your head may be different than mine but i think most users will find the koss phones more comfortablegood luckbased on reviews of the great sound quality i foolishly ordered two pair
such a low price why not
this is why not  if all you want to hear is bass these might be ok  but they have very little range
the sound was tinny and i regret the purchase
unfortunately shipping to return them will cost almost as much as the items so in the junk drawer they go in case all my other headphones should break
lesson learned once again  you really do get what you pay fori bought these headphones for use with my ipod
while i do spend up to x the price of these for home usage i dont like spending too much on phones for my ipod as they get beat up easily
i figured five bucks good reviews worth a shotthese headphones sound bad
i do know these are quite cheap but ive still heard better even for this price
the problem is the sound is plain tinny
even with some equalization in the mix i couldnt get good bass or a full sound out of these
also the midranges specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced
another issue is the volume
i have to crank up about  of my recievers volume for moderate volume and the ipod is even worse
yes they are cheap and comfy but they sound as good as they cost
ive found that both the sony walkman headphones mdra and the coby cvh for the same price sound bettersound is not that good they are unconfortable actually ugly
they were cheap not much was lost will keep them near the computer but not for long term usei may not be listed as an actual purchaser of this item because i returned the two broken pieces
in the past couple of years i have owned this item had good service from it and felt satisfied even when a part broke
this time it cracked into two pieces within the first hour of ordinary use without any particular strain  it is possible that i received a headset with aged fragile plastic
amazon honored my request to return and credit the cost of purchasei was hoping these headphones would sound like the panasonic rphg headphones i have used for years and years
they have been discontinued and were one of the absolute best headphones i have ever used even though they were cheapo  ones
unfortunately thesepanasonic rpht lightweight headphones with xbs portdo not sound anything like the rphg model and dont even strike me as being made for music
they also dont fit flat on the ears
i think they would be best as computer headphones when watching news videos and such onlinethese work good for the low price and the easy over head use but sadly my head is way smaller than what these are intended for wouldnt work for children then either
theyre adjustable but even on the smallest setting theres a huge gap leaving it not snug and easy to move around with them on these are okay
they fit around my head nicely
they dont really project a quality sound at all
lows of muffely lows and blurythese binoculars arrived with problems and i returned them the rightlens diopter is very iffy and difficult to adjust
in fact i never was able to get a satisfactory focus with it both lenses displayed significant distortion around the outside edges it was impossible to clearly focus on anything beyond  yards the quick focus mechanism frequently failed to work and took a few tries to adjustunfortunately i had some similar problems with recently purchased bushnell x wide angle binoculars
bushnell used to be an inexpensive and decent brand
not anymoreoptically these binoculars are ok considering their low price
but wow do they seem flimsy
the parts that slide in and out to focus are supposed to slide both sides together right
well nothing is rigid so one side can get ahead of the other by quite a bit
both sides will get pushed in changing the focus completely just from holding the binoculars up against your face lightly
the little rocker thing you adjust with your fingers to change focus seems pretty cheapo and fragile
they might be ok for disposable situations but i would not buy these binoculars againextremely lame though marginally effective
i wish i had researched more and got something better instead
live and learn
yupwhen i first received these glasses i was happy lite and perfect but they never aligned properly i had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other i have to give full credit to amazon they immediately gave me a credit and i purchased the barska gladiators which i love and they showed up the next dayi have tried hp and casio palm pcs and returned thenm both
while both are very impressive they dont fill me needsi want a small device that will allow me to keep my schedule check contacts keep a todo list and  jot an occasional note
i dont need a box that tries to do everything is  slow and is clumsy to use
the interface really isnt conducive to editing  spreadsheets or documents
i dont have time to play with the media player  and the thing is too big to slip in my pockceti really wanted to like  these devices but i will stick with my trusty palmi really wanted to like this jornada
but when i got it it just didnt feel right in my hand
the cover  which apparently others like  i hated it
the requirement to store the stylus in the cover is okay but when you dont use the cover and put it in a pack or case there is no where to store  the stylus  that can be a problemthe screen is not as bright as i had  hoped
i am new to windows based handhelds but in pocketpc os it is  extremely difficult to shut down an application and when you get  or so  different things running it gets slooooooowhp usually turns out  intuitively designed products but the wheel for scrolling is useless due  to its placement
the aforementioned placement of the stylus holder was an  issue and then comes my biggest complaint the cf slot cover
this little  flimsy piece of plastic which is designed to cover the empty or full cf  slot but it is very cheaply made and poorly attached  i gave it about a  week before it would have broken off and its placement was such that i hit  it all the timethe multimedia was fair mp files sounded good with or  without the headphones but the player  is poor and i never could get any sort  of avi or mpeg video files to play as indicated
even with usb connection  it took forever to download mps to the cost  very expensive
for  that price it should be manufactured with better materialsthere are  virtuosly no accessories for it
an external keyboard is nonexistant
there  are two companies with ads in the accessory guide who show external  keyboards but upon further checking  neither makes one for the  series  of jornadasif you want to really be efficient i would reccomend the  hp jornada  it has the same memory with better battery life an internal  modem a built in keyboard and moreit works as promised but isnt as  exciting or valuable as it claims
in time i am sure there will be better  accessories and programs but for now  ill keep my paper organizer and  pen its faster cheaper and unlimited storage
palm organizers are  simpler and in most circumstances better unless you need color and  multimediai dont believe that these batteries are fresh
they seem to arrive already weak from age drain or some other issue
for the price they are not even as good as the readilyavilable aasthis is more a review of the seller than of the product
i ordered from best deal supply and the battery was not only different from what was pictured it was a different energizer crv it was loose in a paper bag so i had no way to check the expiration on the battery
when i put it in the camera it seemed like it barely had enough juice to turn the camera on
this continues to be a problem so i am guessing they sent a very expired battery
i have used the emergizer lithium photo silver and blue one before from other sellers and they worked great but the ones being sold by best deal supply are not a best deal so just be careful which company is filling your order and you will probably be finei dont think it affords good protection for the screen
it visor snaps  in solidly to the case but is somewhat difficult to get out for modules  etc
i dislike velco closures because then tend to end up looking  quottackyquot as things begin to attach themselves to it fuzz dust  etc  it also doesnt look likea case that will last for a long time and i  think i would have been better served by sepnding more and having it many  times longer
although i have to admit the case visor sends with the  deluxe is a dreadful slipin thing this is an improvement over that but  i would still save a little more money and buy something more sturdy and  solidwhen it works it works flawlessly
when it doesnt well lets say it isnt very pretty
rebooting with the card reader plugged into the usb port on a win box will consistently lead to a blue screen of death
reader has to be plugged in after windows boots which is a drag
not bad overall but there has to be better out therehave used the fine pix for months nowmy personal experience with itpluses reliable easy to operate nice combination of features small and handy but see below battery life ok for about  picturesminuses have to work hard to get sharp pictures  usually i do not succeed not really  a pocket camera redeye reduction never worked with my kidsoverall if you can get it for  it is a good deal current price of  seems too expansive for what you geti know i took a chance buying used but i have to constantly keep is on manual focus to use it
which is not always easy to get a clear crisp photo when needed to be done fastwhy i got this lens ill never know i may have a problem with buying lenses  yeah thats it
got this used on ebay with the hope it would be sharpwrong
it was soft through out if you can get this lens for free thats a deal
dont waste your cash if you like good looking photosthis is the first slr lens i ever used
not a very memorable experience i have to say
the lens is cheaply made not at all sharp has a very limited zoom range and is very very very slow
the lens is so slow that it really isnt useful indoors at all without a flash
the wide end of the zoom range  mm  is insufficient for landscapes while the telephoto end  mm  doesnt offer enough reach for distance shots
the build actually feels as if the zoom and focus mechanisms use internal cardboard components
i would be hardpressed to find another eos canon or thirdparty lens that was as uniformly mediocre in all respectsinstead of this lens i would very highly recommend the canon ef mm f ii which is sharper than this or any lens you can find for twice the price
granted the mm isnt a zoom lens but the limited range of the mm doesnt offer much of an advantage anyway
and the mm is nearly  fstops faster needing only oneeighth as much light for a shot making it great choice for indoor and dim lighting conditionsevery person that buys an slr camera invariably ends up with lenses that cover focal lengths of mm to mm  a mm and a mm lens
this one fits the latter requirement
for  bucks you get a long mm focal length
but thats about itthe slow autofocus aside this lens is extremely soft at all focal lengths above mm or so
i recently made the biggest mistake of taking this lens to an airshow
i thought the light weight helped me with the maneuverability of the camera but then when i saw the pictures i was terribly disappointed
there can be nothing more disappointing than figuring out that youve done your part well composition exposure etc and then find that your lens failed miserably
the f jets had soft edges and looked like they were portraits of women
i had to apply unsharp mask filter in photoshop several times to get something that i could put on the webimho canon really failed on this one and i guess its time they replaced this lens with something betterfor those of you that are reading this review and are looking to purchase a lens in this focal length range and price range
 i strongly suggest the sigma
if possible get one with the apo designation on it
i guess it costs  more
but the quality of images it produces is far better than this canon
as a nice addon it also offers a macro switch that enables close focusing to achieve a  magnificationi know there are brand afficionados out there that will buy nothing other than a canon  good or bad
if you are looking for quality in a lens of this focal length and price range avoid this lens
also dont go to ebay and buy the is version of this lens  its got the same bad optics
canon recently replaced it with a mm is
i guess that is very good
of course the legendary mm is with a price tag of  is stunningthis lens might be okay for beginners but if you are into any quality photographyget the canon  l f or f with or without isconsslow aperturenot sharp enoughnot an lpaint is chipping offpros cheep but not worth it unless you dont care for qualitymy recommendation buy a canon  l instead even the f will blow this lens awayi own the  is and ive been using it for a while
i borrowed this lens the other day just to test it and it was terrible in comparison
soft no is noticeable chromatic aberration over mm
it is better than its predecessor the ii but still not a good lens
go for the  and you wont regret itthese lenses have an inherent problem
all of a sudden you get a message that the lense can not communicate with the camera  clean your contacts  well clean your contacts all you want it will not fix the problem
the problem is internal in the lense
the good news is you can send the camera off to canon with an estimate repair cost of about   dollars the bad news for a few dollars more you can buy a new one
bottom line do not buy this lense buy a better one for a few hundred dollars more in the end you will get much better pictures and it will work much longer then the year mine didi bought this lens on a killer clearance deal after missing an opportunity for some nice shots of a coyote
i just wanted a simple lens for an occasional wildlife snapshot
the image quality was so bad i took it right back to the store
it is unlikely my expectations were too high as i love my rebel xti d kit lens which is considered one of canons worst
i picked up a tamron lens of similar focal length and have been reasonably happy with it
id steer clear of this one unless you just want an slr to look coolthe lens is an entry level lens and would be well served to have is built in
but even in ideal conditions good lighting fast shutter speed tripod mounted it is still a subpar performer
the images arent crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat
it does allow for a nice enough bokeh background blurring when taking photos of someone  feet away or so
generally that isnt easily accomplished by the  kit lensgood photos can be taken with this lens but more photos will be lost due to blurring or simply not being crisp enoughif you are on the fence as to whether you will use your dslr then this may be a good option
if it turns out you really like it then invest in the mm
if you are starting out and you know you will like it then invest in a mm from the startlook at the price folks
that says it all
unless you need this lens for a special reason then dont bother
if you know how to use this lens then go for it
but as i stated before look at the price
there is a good reason why its cost is a lot lower than the is lenses
if you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then dont ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular resultsmanually crank the lens to mm infinity and nothing in focus
back it off a bit and now it is in focusive used a lot of different telephotos lenses from this one to the better canonmm model themm do and the wonderfulmm f l lens
this one is not terribly great
it tends to softness particularly at the upper range can show flare and ca and the build quality is poor
in fact after a couple years of use the autofocus on mine stopped working the only lens ive ever owned to have such a problem
ive seen similar reports on other photography forums so mine is certainly not an isolated problem
to repair it would cost almost as much as the lens itself so it basically was trash at that point and i certainly was not getting another one and upgraded instead to the mm which is a far better lens all around
id suggest that anyone that needs a lens in the  or less range look at the latestsigma offering which is a much better performer than this lens and gives you some decent macro capability as well or the newcanon efs mm lens
while ive not tested this new lens myself its gotten very nice comments for the most part and is in this price range is a real bonuslens functions ok no issues there
what is disturbing is its ability to clearly focus
all my distance shots are fuzzy  as a test i took a shot at mid range or  mm and magnified it with standard photo editing software
all the detail was fuzzy
i took another lens and performed the same test and the magnified image was sharp
i now have a rather pricey paper weighti got this lens for free when i bought a rebel xs
while getting a telephoto zoom lens was better than not having one i really disliked this lens other than the price and extended rangepros greatly extended lens vs the xs kit lens mmcons no image stabilization meant using a tripod tree table etc
all of the time very few shots were extremely sharp in less than ideal conditions worked great on a sunny beach boardwalk and thats it not a lot of saturation or contrast in the image colorsif you are using one of the apsc sensor canon slrs rebel series its only  to get thecanon efs mm f is telephoto zoom lens for canon digital slr cameras
in the world of slr photography  is nothing
youll get is which will give you much better images sharper better colors etc and its my guess that the lens optics are much better too
the only downside of this lens is that you wouldnt be able to move it to one of the full frame slrs in the futurei bought this along with my canon xs as part of a packaged deal in   i have used this lense about  times
i like the reach but thats about itsorry but this lense just doesnt do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp
honestly if you want something i would suggest the  usm or even the  f l  the build quality on this lense is cheap
the focus ring is small obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways
the filter does move whenever you focus not good
there is no image stabilization eitheri wouldnt recommend this lense unless it was pretty much freethis lens is cheap and for a reason
it wont focus sharply when the aperture is wide open so its hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject
its high fnumber means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake and forget about action shots unless its full sunlight
it also has very bad chromatic aberration this may be corrected by a uv filter but i havent tried it
it shows purple halos around dark objects when theyre set against a bright backgroundthe lens does have very nice autofocus though
its very fast especially after its found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shotsoverall this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens but its quality is low and its not good for much more than learningoriginally ordered the canon xis as an upgrade to my superb canon xisfirst x pair ok for terrestrial use but displayed flairing on jupiter through the right eyepiece left was ok
i exchanged themsecond x pair jupiter flaired in both eyepieces
i then noticed that the flairing only happened when i turned on the is
i returned them for a refundergonomics the rubber eyecups must be folded back for these binoculars to be usable
this helps make the eyepieces so big that there was not enough nose relief to get the binos close enough to my face to see the whole fov without really jamming the binoculars in to my face they left red marks on my nose
after some searching i found that many others had experienced the same problem some literally took a pair of scissors to the the eyecups to increase the nose relief
not a good thing to do to such expensive binoson a clear night from my urban sacramento back yard i used these binoculars to detect m  something i never thought binoculars could do from my location
keep in mind that this feat took about  minutes of focused study knowing exactly where to look and the indications of this faint galaxy that i managed to pick up were only perceptible  of the time
while these still perform more like binoculars than a telescope you do get that feeling of now your cookin with gas
too bad my samples had bad optics and the ergonomics didnt fit my faceone more thing these are heavy enough that after the novelty of a new toy wears off you wont want to travel much with them
the only use i see is astronomy where you are reclined in a lawn chair with armrests on which you can comfortably brace for extended periods of timei give my existing x canon is  stars but cant recommend the canon xafter two full days of fussing i cannot get the targus wireless keyboard to work with my casio e or my sons casio e
i bought this keyboard after reading dozens of reviews of different wireless keyboards because the features looked good
there was some ambiguity about its compatibility with the e on the targus web site but the package itself lists the e as a compatible pocketpci first had trouble with the software installation program provided on the cd
the first window asked me what kind of operating system i was using so i checked pocketpc
the next window popped up behind the first almost totally obscurred and all attempts by clicking or switching windows failed to make it visible
when i used the task manager to end the process that was listed as nonresponsive another process took over and seemed to finish the installation properly
but when i tried to use the keyboard with my casio it did not workmy next problem was with the support area on targus
none of the faq seemed relevant to the problem
the best suggestion was to uninstall and reinstall perhaps without any memory cards
so i did this and uninstalling was not easy but still had problems with the obscurred window and frozen processnext i checked for an updated driver installation program
there was one so i downloaded it and tried again
this version did not produce an obscurred window and did not freeze so i thought i had it by now
but the e still did not work with the keyboard
i checked everythingthe batteries in the keyboard were good
my ir port worked with another computer
i just could not get a connection between the keyboard and my emy son owns an earlier version of the casio pocketpc the e
i tried using the targus with this version and it still failed to worki looked around the targus web site for a way to ask about the problem and found nothing
i can find no help from other casio users on the internet
it seems that everyone else is using either usb keyboards or a different wireless keyboard
i feel alone and depressed after looking forward to using this product
it does seem to have great features
it got some great reviews by users running the same operating system software on different pocketpcs so i cant believe it doesnt work on mine
i wish i could figure out what is going oni admittedly bought this in a bit of a hurry as it was for a nearlylate birthday gift for my son who had just moved into a new apartment and wanted a router for his new cable service
the reviews for this model sounded good  and i have another model from linksys that works fine  so i took the bait
bad decision
if id read the review dates more carefully id have noticed that most of them were many years old going back to  or earlier
this i failed to do however my bad i knowi knew something was out of whack when i opened the sealed package and discovered a layer of dust coating the top of the router
the included ethernet cable refused to plug into the back of the router  a bad cable end  so i replaced it with a cable of my own
entering setup i found a primitive ui and limited set of choices there was enough there though to set it up for what he wanted
but it was all looking older and older
unfortunately the router wouldnt work right away and after getting information from the cable company to no avail we called linksys support to get configuration help with our brand new router
we were told that it was out of warranty
no i said its brand new
checking the model and serial numbers the tech assured us that it was indeed well out of warranty and offered to provide support for a charge of we turned down that generous offer and figured the configuration out for ourselves
properly configured it has worked fine for the last week
but i call it unethical to fail to mention in the product description that the new product you are purchasing is not covered by the expected manufacturers warranty
knowing that would have altered my buying decisionprospective buyers be aware that you will not be able to get support for this router without paying a fee  this thing has no warranty coverage from the time you open the box
it may be new to you but not to linksysmaybe i should have known better but i am positive the description said the flash was automatic with the canon camera that i have
i expected a flash that would adjust itself to the camera settings and provide the correct flash in all situations that were within its range not so
or maybe it would work the other way around and the flash would set the camera settings not so either
im going to check and if there is such a flash this one will go back fastdisappointed that this cant be used safely with my canon d
have to return it for a safe onebefore putting a hv on your camera please check with the camera manufacturer first
the  hv open circuit trigger voltage measures as much as  v and many cameras are not rated for this voltage
canon usa claims that canon slrs should not be used with triggers above v
and olympus says dont exceed  v  nikon says v
is the maximum safe trigger voltage
cameras that meet the iso  spec
are supposed to be safe up to vmost modern cameras use solid state flash circuits not mechanical contacts as old cameras did so the use of even a slight overvoltage can instantly do serious damage
building a universal electronic flash with a v
trigger voltage for todays cameras is really not very smart engineering when most well engineered units trigger using  or  volts maximumits interesting that vivatar uses a hv designation for this flash unit
the old film era plain vivitar  and vivitar  flashes had a trigger voltage of over  volts but the hv version is v which unfortunately is still too hv for many camerasif you do a web search for electronic flash trigger voltage you will find tons of info on this subjecti started out buying more expensive canon flashes but didnt need the ettl features
based on a web review i bought a couple of vivitar hvs and used them with my existing offcamera triggering system which consists of elinchrom skyport radio triggers and wein optical hot shoe triggers
all of my existing triggers fired through the hot shoe of the flash and have worked with a variety of flashes including older vivitar  flasheshowever the hv is triggered on a different contact point than most flashes
it works fine oncamera but doesnt work at all with any of these remote triggering optionsive found that you need to use the trigger port on the side of the flash
wein peanut slaves have a high failure rate but sonia triggers seem to work much more consistently well with this flashonce your system is working these will fire consistently well
they dont recycle as fast as some of the more modern and expensive designs but if you take your time and compose each shot well you should be just fine
ive been replacing all of my other flashes and standardizing now on the hv for my field geari use these for semiprofessional fashion and art photography and it often surprises people to see me using such humble looking equipment and yet i get great results from them
 long term update these flashes only last a little over a year and then they are kaput
i have had a few of them all purchased around the same time and in the middle of a shoot they will suddenly flash brightly and then not work anymore
as far as i can tell these units are sealed up and not meant to be repairedi tried in my sunny garden to baseline the quality and it did not come out good
comparable to cvs pharmacy disposable mm
it went downhill from there  the underwater pictures were not worth it
out of all the pictures there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper
but its  bucks
so cmon experiment with it
if you dont like it after that youre out    bucks after developingwe took three of these to the west indies so my daughter could complete a science assignment
one worked well  one seemed to work  until i had them developed and discovered that the film had broken and no pictures were taken
i still have the third  anyone want to take a chancemy daughter took it to australia this summer to capture the great barrier reef
it didnt come out well
blurry and about  of the pics were black and unable to print
so i would not buy again
disappointingthis would be great for entry level slr with shorter lenses  doesnt fit my canon d with any of the zoom lenses  must return itusing this with my canondlight camerathe quick release plate is loosethe adjoining joint that swivels the camera degrees vertically is wobblythere is just no solid feeling to anything about this plastic standi own a couple of manfrottos and have used a myriad of other aluminum based stands that are considerably more solid then this onethough costing considerably more as wellyou certainly get what you pay for so my hopes were not highthat being saidcost is  starsfunctional build is the panning motionas i was using this purely for video with the canon d is okthe dampening tightening screws are okwith practice one can pan fairly smoothlyhowever using both axes during the pan will quickly expose the weakness of the faceplate jointscausing an uneasiness to vertical pansi do like the lightnessdefinitely a short tripod standits a minitable top or floor only tripod so be prepared to sitbut a low vantage can add new interesting perspectiveshope this helpsits not the cheapest but its the cheapest good one
unfortunately it shows as some of the components do not feel solid or feel a bit loose even when tightened up
for the price i cant complain this tripod has very smooth movement and is very stable
its not super light but not difficult to lug around
the quick attachment for the camera is not always quick as it can be difficult to get it set in just right but after a few uses it gets a bit easier
id definitely buy one of these againupdate  their is a plastic piece that holds the legs in and seems to be poorly built and breaks easily
unfortunately i was directed to return to the maker which is very difficult to get ahold of being in england
they want me to ship the entire unit there and wait for them to fix it which hardly seems worth the cost and efforti was attracted to the colors and i bought them
however since  the hook part of the cable tie is very small it does not give me the same flexibility that the cable ties that i bought at walmart do
and they are all the same size unlike what is shown in  the picturethese work but theyre very expensive and cant be permanently attached to the cable for future unwrapping and rewrappingive converted to velcro reusable selfgripping cable ties and find that giving up color for many many more slightly better designed ties was a good movei bought this  years ago but should have returned it immediately
although i live in a large city the fm reception is practically nonexistant
the antenna has to be set just right to pick up the strongest station in town but even that dissolves in interference when a person or pet walks across the room or a car goes down the street
ive tried the antenna at different lengths and attached wires and foil to it to no avail
the am reception is no prize either the box has to be reoriented just right every time you change the stationnow the cd player is dying
at first cleaning the lens helped a little but not anymore
either the disc wont play at all or only plays the first few tracks then spins out of control making a chattering noise
this is after very light cd use over the years
when it works it only plays factory cds it doesnt take cdrw or mp and is very touchy about cdrsthat leaves the dual cassette playersthey make a lot of mechanical noise when playing and dubbing from deck to deck yields poor quality copies
of course the cassette decks are purely mechanical meaning they cant be remote controlledthis box convinced me sonys days as a quality brand are over and is only cruising on its past reputation
the products lately are in the same class as emerson  other cheapie store brands  preferring visual flash to catch kids eyes while disguising junk insidethis head set works like it says it does but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle useplantronics t  perfect  deadlythis would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly missteps that led me to return itperfectquality build solid the right size the right features buttons for mute hold redial conference and flash plus volume and tone controls
and the mute has a red indicator so you dont forget although id prefer an indicator that flashed like on the polycom conference phonesalso high quality sound in the headset  i could hear the other party perfectly with only a faint background hissdeadly starting with the most seriousthe people i talked with said that i sounded distant
it appears that the microphone doesnt come forward far enough to pick up my voice wellthe headset cord is not shielded and picks up noise from the computer
in particular i had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoided the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both parties heardthe headset cord is very thin and i worried that a minor mistake such as catching it in a closing a desk drawer would seriously damage itthere is no headset for the t that covers both ears binaural
i called to verify this
although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my m the headset from the m does not work with the tit seems like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering changes
but until thenps  there was always a low hiss in the headset
in looking into noisecanceling technology i learned that these systems typically introduce a hiss of their own
in a noisy environment you dont notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry takes out is much greater than the hiss it adds
but in a quiet environment like mine there is no benefit to the noisecanceling feature and you hear the hiss
i cant guarantee that this was the source of the hiss i heard but it seems likely
there is no way to disable the noisecanceling circuitry
i dont think the amazon listing mentions the noisecanceling feature of this phone but its on the boxive used plantronics headsets for years
i was surprised that there was no volume adjustment for the mic  every other plantronics headset ive used had one
i must have had a dozen people tell me they could hardly hear me in  days of use
no amount of adjusting the headset position on my head solved the problem  i had to pull the mic nearly into my mouth for people to hear me easilypity  other than that it was perfect
im returning itbought it

i plugged it into my stereo had to turn my stereo up full volume just to hear itand it still was lowdo not waste your money
buy the memorex mp player its everything this should of been but isntwe purchased this amplifier to drive a ohm load based on the manufacturers claim of a low impedance ohm capability
the unit arrived dead out of the box
amazon promptly credited us and provided a return label
we purchased an identical amplifier locally because of time constraints
when connected to the ohm load it worked but got extremely hot and we shut it down
we double checked the ohm load and it was ohms
we returned the amp and purchased a completely different amp in slightly higher price range from a different manufacturer
the new amp worked fine
the audiosource is ok for a basic small ohm load and does not have the low impedance characteristics advertised by the manufactureri have been using track ball devices for the best part of ten years
by far the best is the microsoft microsoft d trackball optical mouse version that has served me well so good in fact that i have had three
when it came to replace the office one i decided to go with a cordless model and see what logitech could produce i have been very disappointed with it for the following reasons sensitivity and precision are compromised by the method of tracking the ball logitech have chosen to use there is a tendency to jump and stutter across the screen and despite many attempts to correct this cleaning device drivers reassociating device with receiver etc the issue persists
 only two mouse buttons  some people will like this but given that logitech produce some of the best mouse devices available this is something that is missing
 build quality is terrible  yes it is plastic but so are a lot of other devices and this feels very cheap and not well manufacturedi am really not a fan of this device and would urge anyone who wants to purchase this to try it out firsti love trackballs and tried the corded version of this one because my hand fit it well
but i found that i cannot get used to having the trackball under my thumb  its excruciatingly awkward
obviously ymmv  many reviewers here like itplus having used kensington trackballs for a long time i find that this ball is too small and does not roll as smoothly as im accustomed to
unfortunately kensingtons current main model has other problems which ive reviewed there
and the new logitech which has the ball in the right place only comes cordless which id rather not have to deal withedward i see the brevity of truthmy old review is below and i still think the ergonomics are great with this tracball
however in the last  months i have gone through  controllers
i have  wireless tracballs and  broken controllers
i am sorry but there is no excuse for electronics without moving parts to be so fragile
until logitech builds durability into the controllers stay clear of these units and get a corded onereal shame these are very wrist friendly designs but  breaking without any damage is wrong
fool me once shame on you twice is on mesome have complained that the control part of the wireless mouse that plugs into the usb is too big
i velcroed it to the lid of my laptop and also can stick the wireless trackball unit itself to the velcro on the lid also
that taken care of this is one excellent ergonomic trackball
having it now wireless is only that much betterbest trackballmouse for ergonomics but so far not as durable as it should bei will try a second one and report back on that one as welli have long resisted for long time to buy another pda i own a twoway pager with full mini keyboard partly because those palms are so expensive
then i saw the m
it is made to compete with the visor same price the visor comes in colors for the m you can buy face plates matching your dress for the fashionconscious made of plasticwell palm had to keep the cost down and so they dropped some features or used cheaper materialthe bad smaller display but ok reading quality smaller input field writing tablet at the bottom as well this is a product for people with small hands plastic looks cheap and not sturdy at all but makes the m lighter comes with a serial cable to connect to the pc while other palms come with the hotsync cradle
 only mb of memory just like the visor i believe which is sufficient for the beginning until you use the software heavily
especially the included avantgo software that downloads news texts from channels when connected to your pc is a memory hog
downloading email with the available modem would be another way to use up your ramwhile the visor can be upgraded you cannot buy memory for the m operating system os is not upgradeable either
it does run palmos  which lets you use software from a very big pool
you can download applications from the web such as a new datebook or games
this by the way was the  reason why i bought a palm instead of something different unpractical design  if the flip cover is closed it rests on the keys at the bottom
if you press it lightly you will turn on the m involuntarily
the cover has a window though so you can read the clock through it  nice in those boring meetings when i am too polite to stare obviously to a clock or watch different interface for extensions  if you have additional stuff from an old palm pilot or want to share something from your buddy in the office  it probably will not fit slower processor  it runs at only mhz like the visors the more expensive palms run at  or mhz
well computing speed is not really an issue with pdas but palm supporters criticize the visor for running at mhz so i will list it here
to put things in perspective i believe that my pager runs at mhz and it is ok as wellfor fairness here a list of the good featuresthe good  smaller but thicker than other palm pilots lower weight backlit display can be adjusted so you can read the m under different light conditions comes with decent software as the visor and other palm pilots a modem is available but how much email do you want to download before your mb of memory are fullsummaryit does have its advantages to follow a standard and the standard is palmos
the main advantage is the availability of software
i hear that there are people porting linux to new pdas including nonpalms
that may be a step in the right directionas you can see i am not really happy with the m
i bought it at office depot and the store has a good return policy
ive had it for  days now and i think i will return it
it also turns out that i do not really need it particularly since i have the pager alreadythis came in on the latterand cheaper end of the long line of excellent palm products and is a very easy to use ergonimaclly friendly toy
yes i said toy because unfortunately its just too out of date
you can now have as many features on your cellphone as this offers and even at under   buying something that has only mb of memory and is not upgradeable is simply a waste
no offence to palm i like their products and have had several but please wake up and smell the future
there are now a great many affordable pdas out there that you can do so much more with and products like this however well made have just been left behind
for example at still under  is the  hewlett packard jornada  color pocket pc  upgradeable and has ten times the power and functions
save your money and buy something more moderni have the  wmb memory but its the same pda otherwise
the good stuff is the size and easy to carry around
the bad stuff is that you must use a serial port the usb kit rarely works and is major trouble
my pda has to reset whenever you change the batteries so i must do this next to my computer to resynch
if you can get it for cheap it does the basic job
make sure your pc has a serial port to sync many newer pcs do not
also downloading software updates from palm is a crapshoot since many dlls did not download
support via email does not resolve problemsplastic
might work
never used
i bought a ram mount instead
that thing kicks ass
buy that instead way betteri bought this to mount my etrex on my road bike
it will mount securely onto handlebars up to  diameter unfortunately most handlebars on modern road bikes are far thicker
my handlebars flare in the middle where they sit in the stem and i was able to move the mount towards the outside of the bars where the diameter drops down to  but in this position it takes up some of the space where i like to rest my hands forcing me to make a slight adjustment to my riding position
i would like to see a mount like current bike computers and lighting systems use  able to fit on a wider variety of tubingthe mount positions the gps towards the rear of the handlebars encroaching on your cockpit space
this is fine when im sitting but when i am sprinting or climbing out of the saddle i have to be careful not to hit the gps with my thigh
a more forward position would be appreciated
and a more forward position would keep it out of the way of my dripping sweat
finally a quick release mount would make it far easier to switch it between bicycles as i would like to dooverall this mount has pretty severe limitations for me but it will probably work fine for a recreational rider
i will try to rig something that will better suit my riding styleunfortunately it does not fit os sized road handlebars  mm bars
basically its a worthless lump of plastic to methis did not fit my gps
my vista cx has a micro sd card mount on the left side of the battery case
the back for this did not have a notch going around it so it would not attach to the gps
i dug out my dremel and cut out a notch in the back in order to get it to fitif you are looking to have this fit your vista cx or any other garmin hand held that has the memory card mounted next to the batteries make sure that you are able to modify the mount to go around the memory card if your gps is set up that way
not all are but mine is so this had to be modified to fit
be aware as this is not a universal bike mount for all the garmin hand held gps units listed in the description
you may need to modify the case in order for it to fit your gpsthe case has a plastic window over the gps display
unfortunately it makes the gps harder to read especially if the light is not ideal
also the window is a little too small and tends to cover the top of the screen
since two of the main menus are at the top of the screen this is a problem
although i would like the protection provided by the case i find i cant use itif this item is supposed to protect a venture etrex its weak
the upper side of the gps is not covered in the sides just only a narrow area in the centerits very easy to find sand or similar dirt between the gps screen and the case that could be worse than having no protection at all
what about a more tighten designmaterial even worse the shape of this case seems to be for a different gps model as it gets in the way of the enterrocker key that is for sure the most used buttom of all the device
this obstruction makes me remove de case almost every time i want to touch the enterrocker key
a real disadvantagethe clip and the strap are good but this case shoul be redesignedi received this case with my new etrex venture
if came in a bundle with the mapsource software a usb cable and a lanyard
however on my unit at least the belt clip slides into a pouch on the back of the unit
the first time down the trail the case slipped off the belt clip and dropped softly to the ground
not acceptable
it will provide protection for your unit and the screen the buttons are accessible but not being able to clip it securely to clothing or a pack limits its usabilityupdate  i just received the micropak case from gps outfitters on amazon but currently not being sold
its a big improvementa belt clip and a belt loop pockets for accessories a carry strap attachment loopand the garmin etrex with the supplied case fits in it snug as a bugtheres nothing wrong with this product it works as advertised i just dont like it
the reason why i dont like it is because its not that convenient to access the garmin
i have to either take it out of the protective skin or pull out the carrying case altogether
again this is totally my fault that i dont like it there was no false advertising at all but if i had a chance to purchase it all over again i wouldntthe belt hook does not have a good catch it would be easy to loose the gps without noticing it happened
a slight change to the design could fix this issue add a bit of a hook to the belt clip to snag on a belt or fabric
secondly the velcro flap is awkward
it would be easier to use if it went from the back over the top and attached to the front
this goes from the front over the top and hooks to the velcro on the back
third the button access is somewhat restricted
if a little more cut out for the buttons was there it would help a lot
probably returning it
i have ordered something else that i think will work better
i like the quality of the construction over all
final thought i would rather not have the plastic window
if i were keeping it i think i would cut it out
its too glossy and restricts the view of the screencase barely fits the device
openings do no line up with the buttons properly
case makes it difficult to use the control stick
window does not properly line up with screen
avoid this case
the device is very sturdy itself and this case does not add enough protection to warrant the hassle associated with itbut the whole design of the top leaves much to be desired
you can get to the four way hat switch but id have rather just had a hole in it instead of this sleeveless approach that leaves a lot of it exposed without adding more functionality
the top still gets in the way of the hat switch which is the whole reason to have a hole there in the first place
other than that the item quality is good and its holding up
people that design this stuff should have to use it or use a prototype this should have been caught at the design stagethe basic functions of this mouth operate just as well as you would expect the buttons function smoothly the wheel works well and the entire thing is plug  play on my laptop running windows xp homethis mouse is not however suited for gamerssimply put the optical tracking system is far too unresponsive
what i mean is this attempting to move the mouse quick from one side of the screen to the other will result in the optical sensor failing and the cursor simply getting confused instead of making the trip across the screen
gamers especially the fps variety will find this an extreme detriment to their gaming ability
invest the extra money and purchase a logitech mouse with mx tracking technology  theyre much more accurate and responsive unlike this cheap clunky devicei called logitech about the way the scrolling was not working and they attributed the problem to the fact that i was hooking it up to a laptop through a docking station
dell inspironi love the look and feel of the mouse and the button action feels good but i really wanted the scroll wheel to workolympus makes great digital cameras but their recorders are to die for especially when you interview someone and get back to the newsroom only to discover that while the tape was moving the condenser mic had decided to go south on you and the only sound you hear is the motor and a weak faraway voice
cleaning and demagnatizing the heads didnt work for me either so buy a recorder with a blinking red light that indicates what youre recording is what youre gettingfor interviews spend the extra money and get a super quality producthonestly i dont like it
sorry but save your money on this one particular model
just being honest
maybe only this particular model i must add
ive owned several other uniden cb radios plus two different uniden vhf radios for my boat one fixed and one portable and enjoyed their features simple and honest design the great squelches they have and more
right now i have a different uniden cb model in my f pickup and it is absolutely great
i think i did a review on that one a couple years ago
this one i have herethe squelch has to be turned  full turn before it works
then it is apparently  full on
so its either  loud garbly hisshsshsshshssshsshsshsss so i can catchreceive weaker signals or its nutnhoney
no gray area here
of course i didnt find all that out until after i paid my bad a stereo installer location while they were already wiring in my channel high power amplifier and newly purchased  jl subwoofer in my ol  motor homehe said to me yeah well install  tune it for just  more while were working on your amp  sub woofer installation  hey for me it was an ok deal
anyway after i leave i start to use it and thats when i found the squelch problem
now because of that i hardly turn it on any more
unless im in convoy with others and the signals between rigs are very close enough so that their cb signal breaks thru the strong squelch on this particular unit
sometimes
i many times think i should have turned it back to the manufacturer but after paying to have it installed and because im differently abled and physically cant do it myself like the goof ol days i would have to pay to have it reinstalled again plus shipping to return this crappy unit i just racked it up as a loss and didnt notify the company one for the record
but ill be rethinking brands on my next personal communications equipment needsand who builds them
my thought is what with everything being built in some asian nation lowest production price usually gets the bid on building these things
i think this because this particular radio certainly didnt get built in the same asian assembly line manufacturing plant as my other unidens
nope couldnt be could it
please know i have had great success with many prior uniden purchases and their performance toojust not this one
dont buy itbuy another uniden modeli mean that
hhmmmmmunless they changed all their models to this new factory
ohhhh noooooooooooothis product is ok i guess for concealing an extension cord or two but thats it
bought it for tv wall mount cords
no wayi like the idea  i like how compact it is
but youve got to be standing in front of the camera to use it
the range is not great either
i had to read all of what it actually did online because mine arrived broken
disappointedi bought this to replace my oem for my canon ti but it did not fit right
the actual piece blocked the sensor right above it
this cause the camera does not switched between menu screen and live view shot
consider the ef instead of eb stylea while ago i wrote a simple review of this stating how well it works
ive since changed that statement i am absolutely disappointed in the performance of this unitthis unit will work fine if you are indoors  i have had a  failure rate outdoors in a variety of lighting conditions and as close as  from the unit
everything ive read during my extensive prepurchase research led me to believe blindly that it could at least get moderate success at a relatively close range 
all the diy hacks in the world in regards to foil or other reflective attachments arent enough to increase the communications between the flash and this unityou are probably better off in the long run to save a fairly respectable chunk of your hardearned money and put buy a set of cactus v triggers akal ebay triggerspoverty wizards
they will set you back about  for a decent set
true they are not a pocket wizard in any sense of the word and will not perform even near the same
however they certainly beat the annoyances that are sure to come when using this product lineofsight is not always possible with otc flashin fact the best option for those not willing to shell out  may want to check out pc sync cables
yes i know its an older technology some say more cumbersome but with the right quality brands on equipment  as many things in life  you get a very stable and consistent set up
no more explaining to your client why you didnt get that last shotokayback on topicpros compatible with all canon speedlites offers wireless triggering capabilities for offthecamera flash has decent battery life can trigger multiple flashes simultaneously fairly simple to use convenient buttons for highspeed sync and flash power settings works well in small to mediumsized roomscons only works with canon speedlite series of flashes nonstandard battery no batterylife indicator no nd curtain slowsync flash capabilities unreliable in outdoor settings and some indoor a little pricey based on featureslets face it if youre shooting with a bracket you need this device
the problem is its not well made
im on my third in a years time
the hotshoe that hold the flash has a nasty habit of breaking at the base making it tough to keep the thing on the bracket
that means my ex has had a couple of tumbles which not only puts your equipment in a bad way it makes you look unprofessional on the job
it was a relief to switch to using gary fong lightspheres and ditch the brackets altogetheri am on my third offcamera cord about one per year
two have broken
as other reviewers noted the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the female end of the cord loosen and eventually faili have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black spring cover over the screws on the shoe
you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver
if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen
canon should do this at the factoryi use this cord with a stroboframe portraitlandscape grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light
the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cordwhen my cords failed i lost the extendedthrough the lens metering just like another reviewer notedi am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails
canon should reengineer this cord to make it more durableunfortunately i do not believe that there are alternative cords
it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cordsi havent found a way yet to pack in two camera bodies  lenses and accessories
its a nice bag just not large enough
especially if you have a full frame body canon d and a couple of l lenses even though the largest is just the  fl
storing the lens hoods is very problematicin addition  the height of the bad is not high enough to safely store your flash units canon speedlite exrt in a vertical positionits a good quality bag  just not big as advertised by canon
im rather disappointed with my purchasethis is one of those purchases that doesnt work well in doing remotely
your better off going brick and morter store
this is not a fault of amazon but that of canon
 update ive given it a few months i take day trips often for photo opportunities hell sometimes for days or a week
i have yet to find a practical way to use this bag
its awkward in every wayso it just sits home  i never use it  still in brand new condition if someone wants to purchaseafter reading rave reviews about the capacity i was confident the bag would accommodate my rebel xsi body one short lens and multiple other accessoriesbig disappointmentthe bag held only the camera body and lensjust barely
this rendered the bag entirely uselessthe bag is very attractive
i cannot attest to its ruggedness or reliability as other reviewers have doneif you have a rebel xsi choose the bag made for that camera
it isnt as attractive but it is a much better choice for that camera and lots of gearthe bag looks great and was well made what i did not like is it was just too small for me
if you just have a point and shoot camera this is all you would need but anything else and it will not be enough spacethe bag is suppose to hold two camerasi have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries
i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here
might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not slrthis camera bag is made good but its way too small
its good only if you are taking just one camera and no lens out for the daybuilt quality is good
but when it comes to space its just too small
i could barely fit my canonti and the extra lens i got with it
feels like i have to struggle arranging and pulling things out of it
everything is so tightly packed feels like i am probably gonna break something one day considering how difficult it is to fit all my stuff in this bag
i wish i checked it before buying it
go for bigger bag this might be too small if you planning on putting more then your camera and an extra lensgood bag but very small
if you plan on carrying anything beside a body and two small lens buy biggerthe construction of the bag is very good but i was disappointed that it was so small
guess i didnt read the ad correctly
when i have my large lens installed on my camera it will just barely fit in the bag and there is no room for other lens or other attachments
the outside pockets would hold some of my accessories but theres not enough room for everything i havethis is a basic flash that makes all the decisions for youits auto only
however the fixed flash head does not allow bounce flash which to me is a deal breaker
indoor shots can be so beautiful and evenly lit with bounce flash but this unit is just a better version of whats built in to the rebel or g series complete with harsh lighting and blown out detail
its too bad canon feels this is a good entry level flashnikon has the very basic sb for a similar price but has bounce ability and is much more powerful than a built in speedlighti really enjoyed this remote at first and it did a great job
however after using the notch in the side to retain the cable the cable fell appart
the notch tore the sheath of the wires and they are now exposed
i did not have it that long about a year before that happenned
it was not heavily used and spent most of its life in my camera bagnot sure what i would recommend instead but given the price i needed it to last longeri take a lot of pictures that requires the camera to be mounted on a tripod
using this remote shutter release seemed like the obvious choice
however after receiving the switch i noticed the switch mechanism seemed a bit cheap
well i was right
after a few months of daily use the switch quit working
even before it quit the switch started acting finicky and wouldnt take the shot right away
i still needed to take photos so i bought a second one
just like the first it stopped working in a few months too arrghhhh
after the second one failed i bought the wireless remote control rc
i wish i bought that the first time
it works so much better and without any wires to get in the way
the only downside is you cant take a photo from behind the camera with the wireless
i guess you cant have everything
i strongly recommend you skip buying this poorly made switch on buy the wireless switch instead
you will be much happieryou stick the palm to the case with velcro but then the case backing is up against the stylus making it very hard to get the stylus out to use it
very impracticalthey could have easily solved this by creating a stylus pocket in the curved part of the case where it folds
i will have to try to rig up something there otherwise the case will not be usefulthis unit is ok to use as an ebook reader maybe but not as an pim device
the screen is larger and the backlight is much better than the palmsthere is no shipping software or manual
the mp music is really hard to hear using the build in speaker
the voice recorder software is not out yetworst yet once you removereplace the batteries the operating system is gone
you have to resync it with your pc cradle
the pc  cradle is not well designed
you need to use both hands to operate itthe software is very buggy
mine freezed up quite a few times
may be they can fix this in the near future
but i returned mine  and continue to use my palm iiixewhen i bought this item i was sure that i had finally solved my quandary of wanting a fully functional pda combined in one unit with a versatile and easy to read ebook
unfortunately the ebookman misses the markthe unit fits in the hand very nicely and its rubberized grips make it a joy to handle
the unit is also very light which is usually the bane of electronic ebook readers such as the rocket ebook or gemstar devices
these are the plusesthe negatives soon became apparent
the downloadable os is a nice idea but doesnt work consistently
the unit is prone to freezing and crashing making it necessary to reload the os and setting the unit back up
you dont have to reenter all your data but you do have to set it up for name and other specifics
quite a pain
another issue i have is the battery life
i realize that standard alkaline batteries are cheaper for the manufacturer but if you use this item as both a pda and regular ebook device you will need to replace both batteries several times a week
this is a little expensive and inconvenient in my book so i would have liked to see a rechargeable battery with the cradle being the chargerthere were several other problems i had with the unit
i thought the device was very slow
i would press for actions and it would delay a half a second
this delay made games useless and data entry annoying
the display is larger than a palm but still is not quite as nice as the larger hiebook device or rocket ebook
the display is very difficult to read without the backlight which exasperates its power issuesthe unit does sync well with outlook and hopefully the future versions of the os will only improve the unit but for now i returned my unit
i also find it a bit unethical to make ms reader one of the big selling points on the box and then only in small print read that they havent figured out how to make it work yetoverall a device that shows promise but doesnt deliver yeti may have read the specs incorrectly but these are not the more robust zip ties i was hoping to buy
that said they came on time and were packaged decently
i do wish that there was a strengthpressure rating to help make purchases easieri bought this for my high school daughter to use as a fun camera for the most partshe  her friends love this izone concept
my thought was this would also provide the digital capabilities she needs for some of her group school projects in a package inexpensive enough that if it were damaged or stolen it wouldnt be that bi a dealthe izone functions work as well as those of stand alone izone cameras her friends have
the problem is that the digital functions are so bad that they are essentially uselessthe problems  the camera is just about impossible to focus
the viewfinder is apparently off kilter and you never seem to get the right segment subject matter you wanted to photograph
the resolution is horribleeven relatively small prints are out of focus and distortedthis camera is cute
period
its great for kids who are learning to shoot photos but the film is kinda pricey when you consider that kids dont really shoot well and might run through lots of film
nevertheless it might be a good learning tool for them since they can instantly see the photo they tookif you are an adult you will be disappointed with this though
if you want a real polaroid look at the polaroid spectraotherwise the camera and kit are great
comes with film focusfree camera lens bult in flash etcthe polaroid izone combo digital camera is a x digital camera with one meg nonexpandable memory fixed focus lens automatic flash and no preview screen on the camera jammed onto a minipolaroid izone camera
its big and awkward which is probably why it hasnt been successful
i can never figure out how to grab it without putting a finger into a lens
i only bought it because i got an extreme bargain on it at my grocery store of all places
overall im happy with it and will use it for my web site and to send photos by email but its no replacement for a mm camera and a scannerits a twain device so you can acquire photos directly from the camera with any twainsupporting software such as paint shop pro
photos are compressed as jpegs inside the camera
it holds up to  shots but unless youre taking photos of blank walls itll be more like  it takes about  minutes and  seconds to transfer a full load of photos from the camera through your pcs serial port
you can download the photos selectively but you cant selectively delete
you can only clear the entire camera memory at once
the jpegs are copied directly from the camera to a folder so you dont have to worry about appropriate recompression unless you want to make modifications
the compression is a little too extreme
if you brighten with gamma correction you can really see the jpeg squaresthe flash doesnt go off unless it needs to so you can get nonflashlit pictures by providing enough light
the exposure isnt very well controlled
indoor pictures at less than  feet are totally washed out by the flash but thats easy to fix
either light the subject better so the flash doesnt go off or partially cover the flash
i used several layers of masking tape
the lens is so small that you can take pictures really close like a few inches and theyll only be a little blurry but the flash must be totally covered with aluminum foilit uses  aaa batteries and doesnt have a plug for a dc adaptor
ill probably install one myselfit uses a  pin serial port so if you have a serial mouse youll need a second port
most computers have a second port but it might be a  pin rather than  if so youll need a converter which will be about dollar amountit does not have a tripod mount or a timer so youll need help if you want to take pictures of yourselfit comes with a mosaic application which converts images to mosaics of other images
youd think it would be fun to play with but it lacks a simple browse option to select your own photos to use in making the mosaic
they dont let you use your own images because they want to sell you their supplemental image cds
of course they dont tell you this up front
i got very aggravated struggling to make it use my photosso i have had this case for maybe  or  years
we use it outside and on the ocean but with long times between use in the elements
most of the time its in my climate controlled office
within a year or so the ballistic nylon strap on the top started to fall apart
little black dustlike pieces of the strap were all over shelf where it is kept
so i cut off the handle to stop it from sheddingthen it was the bottom strap that held on the buckle to hold the lid closed
then it was the straps that hold on the shoulder strap
now its the strap that you can use to hold it on your belti really like the case for all the storage
we have a coolpix  and a flash in the main compartment
for personal use i have a case thats maybe  years older and it has fared much better
next time i will try to find something that doesnt fall apart so quicklythis bag might have been quotbuilt for larger digital cameras and smaller digital camcordersquot but it isnt big enough for them
if you get this youll find you have to squash your cam in there with little room for other supplies in the main compartment
also the front pocket looks nice but it only holds conventional items and cant be made to fit what you want to hold
pass on this one and check out case logic bags if you have a digital camerai bought this bag after seeing the illustrations and it looked like it can fit a digital slr and  lenses the fact is it does but really really tight you need an extra effort to make them fit in it
i have a conon eos d and  lenses   and a  they all fit but i can feel the camera telling my this is too tight
consider buying a larger modeli bought this bag first becasue of its compact size
after using it i found a serious problem that the zippers can slide open when they are not completely closed
i dropped my canon mm usm l lens twice becasue of the zipper
it wouldbe nice to have another strap outside the bag to prevent the flap opening too widei had no idea how small this was going to be
a normal human being would never be able to use the shoulder straps on this
it seems like it might be made for an infant
but why would an infant need thisi was looking for a bag that would be big enough to carry my nikon d    and  lenses
not to mention assorted filters batteries flash cards etc
i thought after doing quite a bit of research that this bag would suffice
and i suppose it might if you carefully tucked everything away in the bag and never actually tried to get at anything
sure the bag will hold a bunch of skinny lenses problems stuffing in my  but those lenses are buried under layers of padding velcroed in such a way that makes all but the exposed camera and attached lens readily accessible
for example the camera and attached lens has to sit on the second tier of padding in order to use the lens gate
under the body totally hidden might be another lens
another problem with the body and lens sitting high up is that the bags center of gravity is higher up and more prone to dump out your gear
and speaking of velcro trying to rearrange the pads is sort of like herding cats
another problem are the storage spaces there simply arent enough zippered compartments to hold loose items
the front compartment is less of a pouch and more of a sleeve
the side pockets only velcro shut good luck if it rains
and inside the top lid
great for storing pieces of paper thats about it
the bag comes down to personal preference
i misfired by choosing this onethe picture is not very useful illustrating flashes telephoto  dslr bodys and lenses
i have just about what they have and no way with what i have
my lenses are just a fuzz longer making this marketing illustration not so accurate
use a tape rule and measure what you have against marketing meausrement for the best idea if your gear will work
it took me hours to reconfigure the interior using dividers from other bags
wasnt able to use hardly any of the velcro partitions inside that came with the bag
i had to glue in velcro on the left and right ends since there was only a little  wide strip centered on the end top to bottom
there wasnt enough velcro to allow dividers to attach on the ends where i wanted or needed it
the front storage pockets are ok  there are two zippers to each of the front pocket that go left and right of each pocket
the problem is the zippers go all the way down to the bottom of the pockets and beyond making it difficult to get the zipper back up in any speedy fashion especially in the middle where two zippers are side by side
they wanted the pocket flap to lay flat which is ok but closing the pockets using the zippers is funky and takes a bit of time if your in a hurry forget it
if the zippers fail  this bag will be worthless
should have used connectors more somehow and zippers less
live and learni was lead to believe based on reviews and the item description that this bag was large and in charge
nope
i have a nikon d sigma mm f nikon mm fg nikon mm fd and a nikon sb flash
there is no way all this fits in that bag
a th lens
not happeningfirst off if you plan on putting your lenses in this bag with lens hoods on forget it
even if you reverse the hoods youll be out of room with just a zoom and a flash if you keep the hoods on
you might be able to squeeze in a smaller lens
 to  though
theres simply not enough width to accommodate for everything they advertise plus lens hoodsok so i tried again with lens hoods off
looking better
i put the  in the bottom left pocket the sb in one of the flash pockets up against the back left the mm on the camera body and put the mm underneath where the bodyzoom lens were going
i placed the body on top of the  and immediately could tell the top was going to be bulging at best with the height of the lens underneath  the body on top and wouldnt close at all at worse
sure enough the zipper was struggling as the camera body and lens underneath was simply too much height
im not comfortable with that since the top of the case doesnt have much padding at all
now i have no intention of letting over  worth of camera equipment get bumped around but when im traveling the last thing i want is to be paranoid that the only thing standing between the top of my camera and contact with other objects is a piece of fabric less than  thickso to sum up this camera bag is well constructed and has a lot of flexibility with adjustable pockets but there is no way in the world that this bag lives up to its description with regards to all the gear they claim can fit inside it
maybe if you cram everything in with a shoe horn but with the prices people pay for dslrs and lenses i seriously doubt anyone is going to willingly shove everything in there
its also entirely possible that they are using much thinner lenses and smaller camera bodies
nikon users however as well as other camera models of similar size look elsewhere if you have multiple lenses and flash units especially if you want to use your lens hoodsi bought this jukebox about a year ago before the version  came out
and boy did i get buyers remorse when a few months later creative introduced the jukebox  with lithium batteries
i could not get more than  hrs with the enclosed batteries and the jukebox would reboot sometimes when going over a bump in the car
however i do enjoy the  gb of storage now they have jukeboxes with gigs
 and since my cd collection isnt so large i get to have it all with me
i bought a car adaptor it was out of stock in the creative online store for months and i did not get it until  months later
in the meantime i could only use it for getting to sleep hooked to the ac adaptorone more thing to the person who said that his jukebox would not even turn on with and without the batteries
you need to stick a pin or paper clip into the reset hole in the back while turning it on or off if it is hung in the off position
i read how you bought all those accessories and feel for youi bought this product as a gift for my brother figuring that the hours and hours of music that it can store would bring a smile to his face
alas he could not figure out how to make it work and returned it for a refund
i am not sure whose fault that is the mfr or my brother but i thought i would write this review to alert potential purchasers that at least one user had a problem figuring out how to make the nomad workthis is not a lens for anyone shooting events indoorsit may be great for those of you who dont mind using flash but i really try not to preference here
so others like it and keep in mind the type of photography you do and take it for a test drive  returnedat mm this lens is very soft its hard to get a shot that looks like its in focus
to do so you need to shoot at about f and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to  or  just to get an acceptable shutter speed
of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts
the focus is also dead slow and often doesnt lock on
this is a lens that i have constantly fought with
dont upgrade to the newer  is either as its only marginally betterbuy the  fl
its a far superior lensthis lens was a handmedown so please keep that in mind when reading this review
it could be that the lens is just usedso with that out of the way i cant seem to take a sharp image with this lens to save my life
ive tried it with and without the image stabilization feature with and without a tripod several iso modes several f stops and shutter speeds nothing
i thought throwing it on a tripod turning the is feature off and also having a  second delay would surely do the trick but to no avail i zoom in on my photo and its still slightly blurrythe photos look pretty good when youre not viewing at  but thats not very ideal
so im glad i didnt pay money for this
again it could be that the lens has just been used too much but id recommend spending some extra bucks on a higher quality lens
if youre looking to zoom in on your subject im assuming that you want it to be sharp and this lens just isntid like to start off by stating that overall i use and like many of the linksys products including the routers wirless products and network adaptors
i also work with computers for a living so i tend to be able to resolve most technical problems on my own accord
this product attempts to fill an industry niche of allowing any parellel printer to be network ready
it does this in two ways a browsable print server or a locally configured porti was running this product without a problem for a while although it frequently would get confused and drop the connection and require rebooting
i have it attached to an hp laserjet p which is a very reliable and stable printer
i noticed that if i ran the product in a mixed type mode using some of the browser print servers and some port based configurations it would crash and just stop working and require a reset
when i changed everything to the same configuration it worked betterwhen i tried to configure and work with the print server from my windows xp home edition laptop things got very messy
i was able to figure out that the windows xp built in firewall was blocking any use of the efsp linksys print server
to confirm my findings i did extensive testing and actually read the firewall logs
apparently this server was accessed on the normal port  but responds on port   to solve this problem i had to turn off the build in xp firewall
i dont blame this on microsoft it was just functioning as a stateful inspection firewall should however linksys developed this product long before xp was on the market and has not put out updated firmware to deal with this situationi called linksys and spoke with someone in the tech support their response was we dont ever recommend using any personel firewalls
perhaps microsoft and some of the other personal firewall manufactures should be aware of the fact that linksys is telling people not to use their products
the fix is relatively simple for linksys simply dont randomly change the inbound port it should be the same as the outbound but the technical support person couldnt understand the nature of the problemif you can affort to purchase a dedicated network printer or a print server from the printer manufactures this is a far better longterm solution
you can also use any computer on your home network and set up print sharing and essentially create your own print serveri tried to upgrade the firmware from the website using the biadmin but the version on the website could not recognize me device so the techntion had to email me a  mb file not available to the general public
this updated utility was able to recognize the device but then when i went to flash the firmware i recieved a quothw mismatch errorquot
so now ive send another email to linksys to try and get the proper quotbinquot file which apparently is not on their website either
for some reason this product will not allow you to update the firmware from the web administrative pannel and requires the biadmin utility seems like a very inconsistent solution compared to their other product linesmy guess is that this product was produced very quickly to fulfil a small market niche and not much rampd or quality went into the design
they havent undated the firmware in over two years which apparently has caused many problems
i gave it two stars because the  port switch worked although a quotcquot note for a  port switch seems like a lot
good luck to anyone who purchases this product you will need iti bought this device because i needed a surge protector
i could have bought a cheap  surge protector but considering the cost of this device  this was a bargain
i wanted to protect a new samsung dlp home theater and new h directv hdr
its a solid metal piece the volt meter and indigo glow is a discussion piece
i noticed the fluctuation in my house voltage from  to why a  well to my surprise one of the satellites do not register in the directv
only when i disconnect the satellite coax from the monster device and plug it directly into the directv h dvr did it register
i would imagine all the monster devices have the same problem no matter the cost since the enginneering would be similarreally too bad considering monsters reputation would have been better off buying a cheaper devicehproduct work well for a couple of months then the right channel went dead
awaiting word from monster about warranty repair or replacementit does not hold the wires very tight
because it was from monster cable i suspect it was made this way on purpose so that you would buy their connectors
if i had it to do over again i would have purchased a more universal productnext time i will read the fine print before ordering
for a  item it does the job adaquatelythis is not much more than an on off switch for the sets of speakers
this was a waste of money for my use
i bought a different unit that turned the speaker sets off and on and controlled the volume of each setfirst off mine came doa out of the box
im going to return it as well anyways and heres why
if you look at the pictures the buttons on the front they look like volume controls but there not
they are simple onoff switches which let you select which room you want to turn on or off
this is my fault for not reading the description but from the pictures they look just like volume controls which is what i needed in the first place
just wanted to let everyone know this before making the mistake like i didi am using this for an outdoor speaker setup including  sets of speakers on  separate outputs
the unit is a nice size and seems to be good build quality
the connectors are solid and i had no issues
my only complaint is that when i only have my zone  speakers selected there is still some output to the zone  speakers
its very low volume but noticablesince this is an outdoor setup its not a big deal for me but keep this in mind depending on your applicationupdate  after a year or so the unit now seems to play full sound over all three speaker pairs
i have to lower my rating for thistoo bad could have easily been a good system
looks good and internal workings are clever
butwhat a shame they simply didnt put good enough springs in the select buttons to the channels
the buttons dont pop back out after you deselect themhad problems with these things from the start
the first one had a flaky display that flickered the second one had a defective cradle that wouldnt charge
after much arguing with handspring about how doing a hard reset of the unit would not fix a short in the cord on the cradle i finally got all the parts and pieces working
by the way handspring technical support is probably the second worst ive ever encountered
their tollfree line is just a recording telling you to call back on a nontollfree line
that line is only available during business hours california time and wait times are regularaly  minutes
finally their support is payperincident an ugly trend in the industry these daysthe unit worked pretty well for about six months
but then ive found most palm devices are created equal as far as that goes
display is crisp colors are vivid although if youre going to be using this outside youll probably want do get a model with a passive display rather than an active display like this one
its almost impossible to see in sunlightone thing i have noticed is that after six months the unit doesnt hold its charge quite as long
ive gone from three days between charges to just over  day
while this is supposed to be common with nicad devices the fact that you cant change the battery in this unit leads me to the conclusion that its intended to be a rather expensive disposable device with about a  month lifespan
with the emergence of cellphone pdas and internet pdas the unit will probably be obsolete before its nonfunctional but if youre planning to hold on to your pda for a while youd best read carefully about replacement parts before making your decisioni wouldnt get this pda bc the springboard modules are really quotinfinitely expandablequot promises
show me a decent springboard module you can plug into this
to date the idea of expanding your pda is great but the modules havent lived up to the promise
the blackberry does a way better job of receiving wireless email
other mp players are better than any springboard mp player
the list goes on
that said youre better off getting a different color pda
although the  colors is great no one is going to get to look at great pictures on such a tiny screen
also this pda is big and clunky
while that may not be an issue for you now it will be in the future
over time you want things to get smaller not bigger
the modules you can get are expensive and they dont really offer a whole lot
plus when you outgrow the module it doesnt expand
great idea but poor executionbought this as a gift for a teenager
it seems to work but has limited memory space  pictures and a slow serial connection to download pictures as opposed to faster usb
but what can you expect for the bargain basement price
good introduction to digital photographer for younger folkbad software hard to understand manual and just too difficult for the child i bought it for
we did much better spending more money and getting a real digital camerathis battery is an overpriced piece of junk
heres why liion batteries are the worst possible option for a digital camera
why
because in order to extend their life they need to be topped off continuously
for digital cameras nicad batteries are the perfect solution
who takes three shots and then recharges the battery
not me
instead a nicad battery lasts longest if you discharge it fully and then charge it up
its the perfect solutions for a camera
ive bought five of these batteries
i hate having to pay so much for them
next time ill buy a camera that takes a standard battery like an aa or aaaworked great for a couple weeks and up until that point i agree with the other reviewers
however skipping got worse and worse then it would freeze and finally after inserting a disc it would tell me to insert a disc
it stopped working entirely on any dvd or cd
too bad
my old sd never gave me a problem in over  years
maybe i just had bum luck but another reviewer noted needed it cleaned after several weeksi bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt
amazingly i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit
i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance  feet to be underexposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu
would be curious if the more expensive units including the ex are better but i cannot recommend this onei bought this lens and was pretty excited about it but ive been disappointed
previous to this i bought the mm  for  and that lens completely puts this one to shame
i need a wider angle lens and went for this one but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results
edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible even at higher f stops
i shoot with a dthe usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one
the focal range of  was also very nice but to me the picture quality was not so goodthis is a standard made in china earbud
not worth any premium dollars
works as advertised but overpricedat least they could put the brand in larger letters for the moneythe senn mxs boast a distinguished brand name and an astonishing claimed audio response its also a real alternative to the vast array of earbud speakers
a volume toggle is a nice touch but its probably unnecessary for players that already have a volume switchthe package claims an extraordinary frequency response well above and below normal human hearing  and certainly beyond that of your average player
if you have an ipod you may find the flat or electronic presets the most satisfyingobviously for  youre not going to get sterephile sound
the mx has a pleasing sound with a bump around the highmiddles
heard objectively they can err to clacky sound but as with many phones you can get accustomed to itthese faults are minimized if the buds are fitted just inside the ear
but if the buds are fully inserted some music can be problematic on percussive tracks with a forward bass absorbing whats left of the modest highsto be fair this is a  earbud and in this price range its an extremely competitive product
but if youre looking for replacement phones for your ipod or decent phones for your cd you may not find music playback completely satisfyingon the back of the package it says  transparent sound and powerful bass
 the transparent sound part is true and powerful bass part is totally untrue metal stabilized system for high levels
 what was that again
metal stabilized system
it has antiroll crossbars i guess
when companies start making vague claims about their product  thats when you know that there is a problemthese sounded terrible at first  no bass  periodthe sound changed for the better once i put on the foam covers
i could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency decent midrange but little by way of bass  even though it claims to have frequency response going from hz to khz
it fits my ears properly so that is not a problemthis product sounds far inferior to a pair of aiwa earbuds that came with a made in japan walkman purchased in i wouldnt even compare the sound of these mx to the excellent koss over the ear headphones i purchased recentlymaybe they are better than the ipod headphones which suck even worse and the reason people give this  stars
really  no more than a  star productexpected much better from sennheiser
with this experience ive decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from panasonic
reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplaceencouraged by all the rave reviews i bought the mx at the airport recently to replace my old wearing out sony earbuds cant recall the model but it was their lowend  one
honestly i am quite disappointed in these mx
in my opinion the bass is very weak and the treble is overemphasized
even playing with the eq on my portable player didnt help much
i do realize these are an entry level model but still compared to my old buds the mx sound inferior and unbalanced
if you want reasonable bass look elsewherei bought several ear buds for my wifes ipod because she was uncomfortable wearing the stock earbuds
sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews
she didnt like any of the options and prefers lightweight over the ear headphones so we put them away
i then bought an ipod and tried the different options that i bought for her
these produce a very muddy sound
by far the best are the creative eps
i now use those and store them in the sennheiser case which is a great design and prevents cord tangleif the carrying case comes with these ear buds and some reviews say that it didnt id buy them because the case is worth i ordered the sennheiser mx inear headphone with carrying case from buycom several months ago to have them as a spare pair
i know it is my fault for not checking them out when i got them
i didnt even open the box
my sister mentioned she needed some headphones and being the nice brother i went to get my new mxs
imagine my surprise when i opened the box from amazon and inside was a bulk packed set of headphones without carrying case wrapped in nothing but a plastic bag inside some bubble wrap
the main reason i got them besides the sennheiser reputation was the wind up carry case
in checking the amazon marketplace sellers offering these headphones today  many mention bulk pack but only one mentions no case and you have to go to the more buying choices by way of the small almost hidden link xx new available from 
and read the full listing for each seller
note to amazon please have separate listings and reviews for retail and bulk packed merchandisethe headphones themselves are average at best in sound quality
the foam covers refuse to stay on
and as the title of this review states they did not come with the carrying case despite the description
i suspect they may be counterfeit  these are too big to fit in my ears after a few minutes they hurt
so it does not matter how good they sound i may have small earsbought these about a month or so ago because i was looking for a replacement for the standard ipod ear buds and i really wanted ones with some decent response
after some research i chose these
after use with a variety of music types eq settings and the like they pretty much have worse bass response than the earbuds that came with the ipodotherwise the sound quality is good and they have a nifty carrying casebutim not using themthe creative muvo earbuds that came with my mp player are much better these sennheisers
they have no volume and very little bass
the reveiws i read about the muvo stock earbuds were way wrong
jjtif failed after about  month of use
i would not order another one
i went to radio shack and purchased one that works much betteri dont like how this cord doesnt strech out comfortably
mmy tv is about  feet away but this cord pulls on the earphones and strains my neck when i try to use it from far away
i wouldnt buy a coiled cord like this again it defeats the purpose of needing a long cord and i totally wasted my money on itthis is the second time ive purchased this item the first time was from a store the sold refurbished products the cord worked fine for a week then i had intermittent problems on the right ear cup then the left cup went completely dead
the ones i got from amazon as soon as i plugged them in there were problems some sounds were coming through others not at all
the volume had to set very high to hear anything at all
maybe i was just unlucky twice but i dont intend to be unlucky three times
i brought another cable from amazon that works just fine i gave up some of the length but in the end it worked outits not a simple plug and play cable
i purchased it to transfer files between my laptops all windows  and i found that it was not straightforward to use this cable to transfer the files
i had to do a lot of research and go through a lot of hoops
i think it would have been easier if i would have purchased microsoft easy transfer cablea cable with connectors is a simple thing
mass produced it should be low cost and reliable
i purchased this belkin product from the reseller
it arrived in a zip lock bag with a sticker stating the essential stuff  manufactuer cable type length
i had the impression that it was repackaged from a retun or a bulk purchase for another manufactuer to insert into  another product
anyway if it worked it did not matter
i connected it to three devices and it did not work
i found out that by twisting one of the cables at the base of one of the plugs it worked sporadically
so there was internal damage or a poor cable connection
there was no evidence of outside damage to the plug or cable jacket
my conclusion that this was damaged from the factory  wheter the product was belkin or not i do not know
since the vendor is not amazon the return shipment is for credit only no option for replacement and no free return shipping
since shipping costs as much as the cable i returned it on principle fully expecting to wind up paying more instead of getting a refund
if others report problems then i would stay way from this product i have a iphonegs with a case the cable wont get on without removing the case
i did manage to use the product for about  days hence the extra star as i was compelled to do so
i was on a  mile road trip
shielding is not that good but good for the price i guess
but somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around  days of use
when i moved the cable a little bit it would go back to normali later returned the product as i had already bought a aux cable from radioshack which i have to say works flawlessly i dont even need to remove the case
its not too over priced i think i bought it for 
i definitely would recommend this over the belkin
that said i am a big fan of belkin products if it were not for the first issue i would have definitely reordered a replacementim sure this thing would be perfect if the alligator clip actually closed
zero quality control here
i have not yet decided whether to return or see if i can find another clip that will work with it
its useless as it isthis antistatic wrist band broke the very first time i tried to use it
if you plan on buying a wrist band i dont recommend it being this onei bought this to help while building my desktop computer
i had it clipped onto the chassis a few times off and on at the start of building while i gatheredunwrapped parts and when i went to clip on again the clip broke
i tried to reassemble but no luckwasnt bad for the price but would not buy againthought it was to remove scratches and stuff but so much for that ideal 
maybe for tiny scratches it may work this is a cheap cord
it does work but i would recommend paying more and buying a higher quality producti dont believe this cable was made by cisco
it is very chinky and poor quality
it works and the price is not bad but low quality turns me offwill not buy anotherthese wipes dried out before i used half of them
before they dried out they left a film on my laptop screen when i used them
and the singlesheet dispenser top was too tight  the wipe i grabbed tore off at the perforation with the next wipe without pulling the corner of the next wipe out
consequently i had to pull off the top every time i wanted another wipe
this may explain why they dried out although i did replace the top every timewipes are tiny in comparison to others and you have to use several of them to get fingerprint smudges off of an lcd screen
i will not buy these againthis cable is hard to unplug
the shielding is great and it is as pictured with great shielding and good connections
but i wont be buying any more belkin brand cables because the ends get stuck in the port
i almost had to shatter the end to get it unplugged
the rubber boot blocks the end tab
be very careful what you plug this cable into you might not get it back outaccording to centurylink technician that came out to my house about  weeks after i installed this cable to my modem it caused line noiseinterference to the best of my knowledge
anyway i had to go buy a regular phone cable to put back on my modem
i may have just gotten a bad cable but due to my experience i cant go higher than  stars
i will give it  for the overall construction of the productseems bulletproof for a phone cablei didnt realize when i ordered it but it is not your standard ethernet cable
didnt work for any of my modem or standard computer connections
i need to be smarter when shopping
not the company fault but would like a better explanation for us amateursthis is just a generic cable rather than belkin branded
there is a white computer generated sticker on the package that says belkin but nothing on the product itself
the cable is very thin and inexpensive looking
disappointed
false advertisingusb cables annoy the beejeebers out of me
you buy a printer for 
then you are supposed to pay another  for a cable to hook it up to your computer
i have heard of the add on sales model as successfully used by gillette to build their razor blade empire but this is ridiculous
particularly ridiculous as those yokels selling the printers arent making any money on the cables in fact theyre getting you on the printer inki bought my cable from amazon for 
it isnt a great price
a great price would be  and that would be what a usb cable is worth
usb should be cheaper than old school base ethernet cable which by comparison had better shielding and a relatively complicated connector but it isnt
someone somewhere is making a zillion dollars on usb cable and id like to track him down and punch him in the throat for itneeded this for a motherboard upgrade i was doing
item shipped did not match the item described so i could not use it
amazon as usual was great and gave me a swift refunddamn in my haste i misread the title
this bracket has only two ports
at this price you can get four ports in one bracket just as goodnot a belkin product
belkin cables have lifetime warranty and have stamped and molded belkin logo
product was a generic manufacturer usb cable not the higher quality heavier gauge belkin product
amazon was fantastic with prompt free return servicethe item is fine  i guess its amazon
i had the printer within one week but the cable i had to have for the printer took  more than two weeks
got it on 
i needed a cable more than a week ago so i had to buy one from a local shop
now i have the amazon cable and dont need it
amazing
what good is a printer if you dont have a cable
i am done with this amazon crap  never complained until now
should have  dot dot dotas another reviewer said margin mart does not ship the grey belkin cable that is shown but rather a cheaper quality no name cable
i had wanted the grey to help identify it in the cable maize behind the computer but i got another black one that looks like all the others
its also very light weight
it will probably work and considering how cheap it was its probably a good dealjust not as represented
with the free prime shipping its not worth pursuing but i just want all to know that the picture and description is not what you will get from margin marti ordered this cable for my canon pro  inkjet printer so i could extend the reach from my laptop
after trying many times to install the driver i found out that the printer cannot work with a cable longer than  ft just to prove my research from other message posting that this was true i hooked up the printer to a shorter usb cable and the driver and printer installed perfectly
hope this helps others who might have wanted to do the same thing
i will just keep the cable and use it for some other device as the price is so low that it is not worth shipping it backthis cable is not the name brand they are advertising on amazon
it is a cheaper knockoff that is probably made in china
i am sure this cable will do just what it is supposed to do but when the picture is not the same as what i received when the post is false the advertising is false and they should be looked at by amazon and removed from their site as a service if they continue to be this shady of a company selling on the amazon sitei ran a cnetcom speed test before installing this and another test after installing
absolutely no difference in my windstream dsl speed
zippoi needed a longer line since i moved my desktop to a new armoire just short of the cable that windstream installed with the routermodem combohigh speed
not for mekeep the cheap phone cord the dsl company gave you and save the moneythis set was barely enough to remove the back of my macbook laptop
i could not replace the battery and had to order another set to get the needed screwdriversthe smaller crosspoint screwdriver wont engage smaller screws
i have a small access cover with recessed screws but the smaller belkin screwdriver will not engage the screw heads
not even close
if forced i fear it would burr the head
otoh this set bxg removed the screws just fine
so i wouldnt trust the small belkin tip on my computeri discovered all this after the  day amazon return period so im now im stuck with a kit that doesnt have the small head screwdrivers i was shopping for
again i can not verify the quality of the other tools  but i have to wonder if they cant get the screwdriver tips right  
also the mounting screws for my apple macbook drives and many external hard drive housings need a torx t which is not included in this kit
mybad for not checking that but if youre a macbook guy you should check whether these kinds of kits include the exact torx tips your computer needsive generally had good luck with belkin products so maybe i just got a bad set
i dont do much beyond removereplace hard drives so i just bought the jewelers set above
but if you need the tweezers extractors etc  my recommendation would be to buy it but try all the tools youll want to use before the  day amazon policy
if you have my problem return them and as its a quality issue ask demand that amazon send you a postage paid return label
that gives you a complete refund and sends a message to belkin
jmhoi just received the film in a timely manor and was excited as my niece just told me she still had the polaroid camera i had bought many years ago
she said she looked for the film and couldnt find
i jumped onto amazon and sure enough there it was
i bought a pack even though the price was crazy high but hey it was for my niece but the experation date is  so i think i will just return it after reading the reviews as to others who used the expired film and it was bad not worth paying over  fori have a compact hp a  printer for my digital prints and its great i like to be able to view a picture before printing
between the ink and photo paper its about  cents a print and soooo easy also small enough to take with you anywhere no computer is necessary you just need an outlet to plug it in and within about  minute your photo is printednever got a clean crimp with this even when using belkinbrand plugs whats worse
it doesnt strip small gauges or even a cat jacket properly
sometimes the catch accidentally slips in
plus its heavymakes typing awkward and the cover looks weird on the keyboard
i guess if i were in an environment rife with nasty stuff potentially spilling on my keyboard id like this better since it would probably protect
i was just looking for something to cover the keys and protect the cheapo letter replacement stickers from wearing off again this isnt right for that useplug and pray not plug and playi had to get a new nic on an urgent basis as the onboard nic in our xp desktop failed due to a lightning strike so i did not get the chance to read reviews first otherwise i would have stayed away from this product
i do rtfm when i get something like this and it said to install it by inserting the card in a pci slot and then powerup and install the driver
makes sense right
in the package the wrapper with the card in it had a big label that said to install the sw first
wth
which should you do first
they could at least slap a sticker on the box
i did finally get it to work by following the manual instructions and rebooting twice
it appears to work as well as can be expectedim not certain exactly when i bought the port hub
i believe it was about a year ago
it appeared to work well with my powerbook g and my new imac but as noted by others it does not provide power to devices even though it is itself powered
other than that it worked ok for a while then simply quit working
the lights come on for about  seconds then go out
short
anyway im going to try another brand as a replacementthe contacts that touch the plug ends were made so tight narrow that i couldnt get the plugs into the sockets
i ended up breaking one of the contacts trying to push the plug in the socket
found myself taking the housing apart to separate them a little so the plug could fit between them
also had to bend some of them straight so they were not touching the opposite row so not to create a short
definately was not expecting this type of shoty work from apci was excited to get this kit but then the screwdriver broke the first use
the little ball that holds in the screwdriver bit came out and cant be repaired
will rma and order another
if that one is better will update review as this did seem like a pretty nice set until it broke so easily
maybe i got a dudlets face it these arent high quality automotive parts there not meant for stress
after a few years of sparingly using this toolkit
the driver magnet fell out so bits dont stay in place
the bits are damaged and chippedthere are better sets out there the wirestripper is a joke
your better off buying a good quality brand name set snapon craftsmen even duralastthis toolkit devotes most of its space to stuff youll rarely if ever use
most of the tools are unnecessarily awkward to take out and put back in
the picture is also not an accurate representation of whats includedvery cheap tools
i read good reviews on amazon and bought this
i always read a revew with a grain of salt alsothe ball on the black screwdriver handle quickly broke off so all the hex bits will just slide off now
all the tools in the bag are cheaply made
it would be better to buy just the bag and then source your own tools for filling it up
accessing bits and such is cumbersum because of the spandex fastners catch every bit when trying to pull out or put back in
i would not buy this againno waylesson i learned is not to buy a kit but to source all parts yourself
this was the best reviewed on too so the others will be worsei didnt expect a much different product but some things were even cheaper that i thought
the flashlight has been an ongoing joke in my small shop  it is worse than something youd get for c in a four pack at a dollar store  including some cheap batteries  the tools are pretty bad  theres nothing here i expect will last beyond six months and not even a week of real consistent work
i bought these because sometimes i do work outside of my shop and i thought this would be an easy to grab kit
i know i am spoiled by my wiha tools at home but these are not something id give to my  year old if he was serious at all about the work he was doing
fine for a grab and go emergency only situation  beyond that  if you use tools such as these for your work forget iti would only recommend this set to someone who needed a whole set of tools quick for a temporary period
it is not a bad tool set but it isnt that good either
i would advise someone to hold off if they could to buy a better set later
there is a nice variety and quantity of tools but they do not look made to last that long
the maker would have been better off not including the flashlight at all it makes the marginal quality of the other tools look even worseon my third battery in  years
not sure if the ups is no good or the batteries are
according to the mfg these should last  years no where even close
the battery is a good fit and does work just not for long
am shopping for another brand of upspurchased this battery when my ups refused to function due to battery lightalarm
put in the new battery let it charge for  hours and put the ups back in use
it lasted about  weeks
now the ups is worthless again
dont know if it is the battery or the ups itself
just letting everyone know it is probably better to just buy a new ups than to replace the battery
the replacement battery is about half the price of a new ups
the original ups battery lasted about  months
i guess ill learn to live without a ups as this  month cycle is ludicrousi can not believe how stiff these keys are
i thought that this was not going to be a big deal but it was a dealkiller for me
on the plus side it is angled nicely with a comfortable hand pad
unfortunately the hand pad takes up a lot of real estate and can not be removedunfortunately the usb is only  feet long and will not reach my desktop pc which is literally under my desk
the product appears to be ok other than that
i only took it out of the box and realized there was no way to connect to my computer with such a short cablethese were replacements for a pair of koss headphones that broke
i went overboard ensuring the same thing didnt happen here and bought the panzer tank of headphones
these things sound really nice but they have two problems as said many times they are extremely heavy
between the weight of the phones and the excellent seal that they create on my ears i can hear and feel my pulse beating in my head
its actually very distracting after the novelty wears off
also i can feel the central bar on top of my head the phones are so heavy i feel it weighing more and more until i have to take them off to listen to these phones on a computer or ipod you need the adapter
if you jiggle the adapter at all you get feedback crackling
i havent had a stereo in almost a decade so every time i use these i have to tiptoe around the connector
i work in a loud environment and this makes these phones more trouble than theyre worthso if you are a cheap audiophile go for it
sound is great on these and they are quieter than my noisecancelling headphones
but for ipodmp players they are nearly useless
you spend so much time worrying about touching the connector   even plugged into my laptop at work i have to pay attention to how my wrist moves the cord to avoid cracklingas i write this my head is starting to hurt and my pulse is pounding in my head again
lame sauce
im going to replace thesethe picture is misleading its actually got an excessups label not an apc label
doesnt particularly inspire confidence in the product
still it installed ok seems to hold a charge and is currently functioning without any issues
time will tell how well it lastsit will write at x speed only on select brand cdr like tdk
otherwise ezcd software will show remaining time as min but it will use  to  seconds to tick one time
i even get crazy when i have a lot of cd to burn since it takes  minutes to burn a sti cdr which was bought from circuitcity
m buffer is just half of the size than other x burner
dont buy it unless it is free after rebate so you can use it as cdrom for your nd pcthe rotation of this polarizing filter is not at all smooth but the filter does what is build for pretty much pretends to reduces the polarizing effect and also causes glare at bright lightsi returned the filter because it was used old ancient packaging and had scratches and fingerprints on it
it was advertised as new
all this is a seller thing and not the filters faultthe filter though was very weak
that is i doubt it would take my glass down  stopseriously
i also noticed without mounting it that when used on an lcd monitor for testing it was very weak at rejecting light at  degrees
that is to say the effect was very weak
in addition the filters outer glass just spun freely
how would i fix thati feel that my best glass mm fl is usm deserves to look through something phenomenal so i traded up to theheliopan mm circular polarizer lens filterbaddest piece of glass i could find
brass rings instead of the aluminum ones in tiffen and hoya and a calibrated wheel with markings make this the choicethere comes a time when checap is just too expensive
i want to make my l glass better so why would i put layeredlaminated glass over itif you have a cheap lens at mm
ok whatever
 then this might really be a value
on the other hand if you know what a circular polarizer even is you probably should be buying the bestive owned many lens filters throughout decades of shootingthis filter causes odd muddymutated tonesvery weird lookingyou get what you pay for
i recommend dont waste your moneythe panasonic lumix fz has a really nice leica superzoom lens that opens to very wide angle  great feature very useful
when this filter is mounted on the lens it screws onto the end the four corners of the frame show the edges of the filter
all four corners are black
once you zoom in a bit this goes away but its annoying
i dont know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but im disappointedi needed a cp in a hurry and was on a tight budget for some photography i was going to do out in the desert
although it does have a high degree of polarization when you are doing landscapes with large areas of sky there is very pronounced color banding
depending on how you have it set it is very easy to end up with a dark stripe right in the middle of the sky with lighter bands on both sides
ive not seen this issue with the more expensive cpsnot adjustableafter reading many reviews i have decided not to buy bw and to save some moneythought cp filter will take my photography to next level after seeing comparison images from other customersto be honest i used it  times and i was so dissapointed since then it is still in original boxi understand user should know how to use filters but effect from this filter is just discouragingive had several tiffin products in the past so i was pretty confident with my purchase here
i was looking for a circular polarizer to capture the bright blue mexican sky on my recent honeymoon
sadly this filter disappointedprosnoneconscould barely tell i was using a circular polarizer compared to nonfilter photowhile not super expensive ive had good success with tiffin in the past but this was a waste of moneyi understand that this isnt a  hoya filter and its my own fault for taking a midrange filter on my honeymoon but i still expected more from iteh too much messingaround at shuttertime to be useful on anything except staged tripod photos
i can do  of what this filter accomplishes in photoshop
wasnt happy with waterlandscape photos at all as the setup to make the sky look good messedup the water and viceversa
i stopped using this with my nikon d probably week later
let me know if you want to buy my polarizeri noticed a fall in the picture quality using the tiffen
i would rather by a better filter at a higher price rather than losing picture qualitythis filter has an okay effect and it spins pretty easily but the part that spins is extremely loose
it moves about a full millimeter forwardbackward just from tilting the camera
if i take it off and shake it it sounds like the glass is about to fall out
it is extremely loose and i will be returning iti may have gotten a bad copy and i suspect it could have been damaged in transit since amazon put virtually no padding in the box
either way i was looking forward to using this and i am disappointed because this is the third time ive had to return some piece of camera gear i just ordered from amazon
sometimes i think amazon orders subpar batches of goods and i really wish their warehouse would put some more padding in the box
im not sure if i will reorder the same item or if i will reorder from amazonhonestly it does not do anything
literally nothing at all
aside from lower picture quality
it is very cheap so really cant be upset
if you want a circular polarizer get something niceri seated this on my nikon   vrii lens the thread depth is very narrow and difficult to seat on the lens
unfortunately i have discovered that putting it on the lens was the least of my isues
getting it off is a whole new challenge in its own right
might as well order the filter removal tool when you buy this filter
i will say functionally it did a nice job on my photos but getting this filter off my lens has jaded me on this productneeded x filter item returned because it could not be used
will order a x next time i order from amazoni bought this to construct a variable neutral density filter in combination with a circular polarizer
it turns out that the polarization ratio of this filter is only about  which is significantly less than the cheap cpl i was going to pair it with
while this is ok for uses against clouds and reflections it means the for a neutral density filter you can only get down about  stopsin terms of build quality it is fine
it would be nice if the ring were a bit narrower as it vignettes slightly at mm on an apsc camerathis is a linear polarizer as opposed to a circular polarizer that people usually buy for slrs so this is somewhat of a specialized reviewi wanted a linear polarizer since by stacking two and rotating them relative to each other you can block some or all of the light transmitted like a variable neutral density filter
with good polarizers this works great
when the filters are at  degrees to each other no light is transmitted at all
but with these tiffens very little light was blocked when crossing them at  degrees
bottom line the polarization ratio of these filters is very weak meaning that these polarize light only a little bit
see similar comments about the  mm tiffensthis mm filter is supposed to fit on my sigma mm lens which according to the specs is mmbut it didnt sit on properly had to use good old duct tape to stick it on
otherwise it works as a red filter just finepro adds a potentially reasonable amount of protectioncons so does an expired condom
it doesnt matter how well this protects the lens surface if you cant actually take good images with it attached
if that wasnt the case why would anyone by something other than a lens capsummaryyou get what you pay for and maybe even a little lessrating breakdown good protection at a great price which is job one for a uv filter  stars superultraspectacularly crappy glare control  stars allowed me to work an expired condom reference into a review in a contextappropriate manner  starthe reviewthis is an inexpensive filter thats also cheap
the glass is stable and mounted securely to the metal ring so im sure it will do the most important job a uv filter can do protect the lens from incidental scratches and light impactshowever in terms of optical quality this filter sucks
part of the problem is the mm barrel
the other part of the problem is the cheap optical coating
it doesnt reduce glareit enhances itthis isnt very noticeable until shooting into direct light in lowlight such as shooting people in front of things like christmas trees
the light goes in the filter hits the lens bounces off the treated layer hits the backside of the filter and stays there
whatever specks of light you have out in front will stay there as ghosted lightows i couldnt think of the technical word so i figured a lightow is like like a shadow only with lights instead of shadeas a base layer of protection excellent
as an addition that will lend itself to any quality other than detrimental excellenti trusted some of the better reviews both here and elsewhere
i felt i needed it because i love to include the sun in my shots
also if i encountered an unevenly lit scene then i can balance the lightproblem is that this is not really a graduated filter
it is abrupt filter
lower half is clear and upper half is stops dark glassonly way this will be useful is such perfect scenarios can be found where upper half is lit and lower half is dark
problem is that only once in blue moon do you get such opportunity otherwise in most of my shots the horizon is not in the middle of the picture
which means that a clear dark line can be seen abruptly
now many can miss it which is why i said this is a great filter for untrained eyei have a sick feeling it is going to take up space and weight and never really be useful
it is very hard to line up the bright and dark areas as well
it is not easy to see it in viewfinder so you have to guess little bit where the horizon is as your tripod is not intended to be perfectly even but in post processing it is obvious where the dark line ismaybe one day i will get a perfect sunset shotand it would be worth iti love the tiffen brand
unfortunately i bought the wrong size but even so the  is very weak
my camera has even some difficulty in sense this filter
i think youll have better results with the  and tiffen usually has good quality control
this particular nd filter has spots in the coating
i still use it but have to remove the spots in post
just take a picture against a blue sky and if the spots are there return the filter
if i had known about the coating issue i would have bought a cokin or lee filter insteadi bought these to help with my macro scale photography for a canon d with the mm lens
the lower end  magnification really have very little effect  you can tell this simply by holding it up and looking through it as you would a magnifying glass
the x lens has better magnification but the camera just couldnt focus through it at all so i ended up returning these
thanks amazonbought this for a trip to disney as we were riding up to the first park i said to myselfself its time to put this on to protect your lens  i had already taken a pic of the parking lot sign we were parked in jafar
it was a bright sunny day and i said self with the haze on that pic this will make it better  boy was self wrongput it on took the same exact pic within a minute of the other one and it was noticeably less clear than the first one with more haze on it so self took it off put it in a bag and returned itits not the most clear glass but it works
however i bought it for the protection on my canon mm lens
it always sounded a little loose and moved easily then finally it cracked
im lucky it didnt scratch my new lens
im going for the bw filters from now on
so much for savings now im paying more than i would have if i just did it right the first timethis is cheap gear
the only things i can say it does as expected are  it fits and  it will protect your lenss front elementmostlythe glass fits the ring poorly and shifts letting dust get to your lens thus requiring you to clean your lenss front element which presents the opportunity to damage it that you were trying to avoid by installing this protective filterthe optics are questionable as other point outif youre broke and just want to keep fingers off your lens sure
otherwise get anything better like a hoya or splurge and get a bwluckily i bought this cheap filter to just act as a lens cap for my mm lens but the glass recently two weeks old started spinning within the metal frame of the filter so when i clean it it spins round and round
would like a replacement but for the  spent on it its not really worth pursuingwhen i got this for my wifes new panasonic fz last year it was slightly loose in its housing and then today christmas  it completely unseated within the circular frame and the camera kept trying to focus in on it rather than the intended subjectthrew it away and just ordered the hoya in hopes of a better filter at double the costwhen i bought my camera i bought both a tiffen and a bw filter just incase there was really a differencei started noticing strange flares and reflections on some of my photos
having seen comparison photos in other reviews of this product i decided to test
after extensive cleaning of the lens and filters i put the camera on a tripod and swapped out the filters
the tiffen created quite a few obvious spots and halos
at night it caused reflections
without the filter it all went away
with the bw i was able to produce some very small spots in the same situations but nothing noticeable without pixel peeping
i plan to replace my tiffen with a bw even for my cheap kit lensive got this filter as a free addon for nikkor f lens
it cant handle any direct light literally any light lamp reflect from the lamp etc
it has enormous reflects
basically it has the same optic properties as piece of regular glass
i wouldnt spend any penny on this itemi bought this filter to protect a canon ef mmf
it does the job but i get noticeably better photos with it off
i guess the debate rages over whether a filter to protect the lens is even a good idea but i usually like to have one on especially if im outdoors or in a dustry environmentif you are going to go the protect the lens route id recommend something better like the hmc  multicoated filters from hoyaa few criticisms
its packed in a plastic case from the manufacturer which is far too large for it so it slides around and rattles inside the case
no foam or anything to hold it in position or even cushion it slightlythe glass on the one i received did not look clean
i thought it was dust but cleaning with proper lens cleaning materials failed to get the glass looking properly clear
it looks permanently pitted or marked in some way
i will not even bother putting this on the lens it was ordered forgreat clarity and well made however i clicked the add both to cart without really checking it out
i am always out shooting at night and this filter does nothing to reduce lens flare it may even amplify it
sending it backthis filter came with my canon mm f is usm lens free from amazon
first night i took few pictures of the moon guess what the photo was not too bad but the flare was very bad like there were two moons
well what do you expectit was free
for the time being i kept it attached to my lens as a protection
will definitely buy another filteri got this filter before i understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well
i was getting such great results with my new mm f lens during the day but at night i was getting a lot of ghosting and flaring in my pictures
it took me a while to realize it was because of the filter
after doing some online research i decided to remove the filter and my pictures were all suddenly better with that lens
the glass was affecting my picture qualitythe glass used is cheap and not very good quality so it can actually degrade your pictures
it works well to protect the glass on the lens from scratches or dust but its a much better idea to pay  more and get a good filter that will actually help you get better pictures
if you dont want to pay the extra for a decent filter you might be better off just leaving the filter off
i reccomend hoya pro and bw filters and in the mm size the price is very reasonable
once you start buying nicer lenses that require mm filters thats where the good filters really start adding up
but again you arent going to want to put a cheap filter on a  lensi know this review might sound negative but if it helps someone capture a  memory better because they decided to get a little nicer filter it will be worth iti ordered the mm one for my canon  iion full frame
this filter is totally useless if you pointed against any kind of light source
greenish flare will be  always on the pictures
wont buy itor recommended for anyonethis comes free if you buy a nikon lens but as many customers said it has very bad flares when shooting next lights
so not much usefulthis is not a multi coated filter
using this on your lens makes the picture quality come down by  notchesif any direct sunlight hits the glass even if the sun is not withing the picture frame the whole picture appears washed out
i only bought this because i got this free with my lens purchase
i always buy the sigma multicoated filters for my lenses
they are truely multi coated and reflect a dim green just like the expensive camera lenses
unfortunately tiffen does not make any true multi coated lenseswhen i used it i found it softened my sharpness of my photos
i further learned that i do not need uv protection as digital cameras are not affected by uv raysi used this for a few weeks before i got tired of all the artifacts and glare present in my pictures
i should have bought a higherquality uv filter right off the bat
oh well live and learni got this filter for free because i bought some other items and up until i got it i had been using bw filters but i decided to give this one a try just to see what it was likefirst of all this filter has a metal ring which is really nice especially for a filter this cheap
unfortunately the optical quality is lacking
you get a lot of ghosting during the day and even more at night so there is a noticeable degradation of image quality
i wouldnt leave this on my camera because of thisthe filter works fine for protecting you lens but the question that you need to ask yourself is if you are willing to suffer lower image quality in order to save a few bucks by buying a cheap filter
i would recommend staying away from cheaper tiffen and bower filters and going for something that will actually improve your images such as a bw filter bw mm clear uv haze with single coating 
if youre really looking for something that will exceed in performance go for the model with an mrc coatingi get glares and reflection artifacts so i never use it just sits in the bottom of my camera bagi ordered one for my eplunfortunately it had an air bubble close to the center
im not so sure about tiffen quality control but its  so ygwypfamazon credited me the  so ill order another and hope
twice bitten ill go with another brandim in a photo shop dead zone and have no local purchaseinspection options
though bb now sells the epl the local bb doesnt and they dont yet have a mm filterthis is the kind of thing you buy when you have absolutely no money and just needs something to temporarily protect your lens
to simplify here are the ups and downsupsgood build quality
glass is nice smooth and without any noticeable warps
the frame is pretty solid for what its worthits dirt cheapdownsthe threading on the frame is ok it screws down all the way but its not very smooth
the biggest downside is that the oem lens cap wont fit snuggly
i dislike the fact that sometimes my lens cap will pop off if i dont secure it tightly but its difficult to tell when the cap wont fit all the way downtheres not coating
not even one
this will affect the iq
not a lot but its very noticeable when theres bright lights
you will see some ghosting and unintended flaringso in the end this could be a good insurance filter if you have nothing else to cover your valuable lenses
but try to get something doesnt compromise your iqi bought this last year for  omg
its  now
urgh
with my tamron mmi used this lens to take portraits and i notice the images are not sharp at all when i zoomed ini later switched to my canon mm i know its different quality compare to the tamron with the bw filter and it was super sharpeven if the shutter was fast and the light was even  out of  images still came out blurry
it bugged me so much to do a comparison test with and without the filterwithout the filter my images were so much sharperas long as you dont zoom in its fineso you really get what you paid for
if you want to protect your lens and not really care about sharpness go ahead to get this thingy
but if you care about the sharpness of your photo stay away
might as well donate the  to spca or whatever charity you supporthad to take it off as the lens flare was ridiculousi do not recommend it pay a little more get something betterthis was included as part of a lens deal
however it is poor quality glass not really worth bothering withit needs a coated lens
this filter causes flare distortion because it has a highly reflective surface
spend more and buy the coated versionwhile this basic filter does physically protect your lens for cheap i warn you that when i put it on my mm f every picture  use in low light that contained a light source had light flashesreflections  which completely went away when i removed this filteri havent tried with a coated filter yet but i dont usually shoot in harsh conditions ie
sandy misty etc i will likely leave a filter off my mm lens when shootingupdate it got annoying screwing the filter onoff so now it just sits in my bag
i can only imagine using it in adverse conditions windy mistly etc  for now will use a lens hoodi ordered a sigma lens the same time i ordered the filterand the wrong size filter arrived mm instead of mm the lens size for the filteri sent it back and they credited my account
need to tighten up qc double check your order before clicking on iti find that the filter works good under many conditions such as in natural light and indoors and it appears sturdy enough to protect my expensive lens
however when i shot images of a burning fire in my fireplace i got several glare spots on my photos
i shot the fire from several different angles and with different apertures and the glares never dis appeared
finally i removed the filter and got great shots with no glare or distortion
had i read other reviews on this product before buying i never would have purchased this filterthis is a cheap uv filter and if you are only using the mm f lens to shoot indoor portraits dont bother with thiswhat a waste of a few bucks
i knew i bought an inexpensive filter but please couldnt you just run a marker around the cut edges of the glass
the edges looked cheap and reflective
dont make the same mistake mine is aging in a draweri read a bunch of good reviews on this filter
i had compared this tiffen i bought  of them and the hoya and another brand
let me tell you do yourself a favor and get another brandhere are my complaints and why i am terribly disappointed the instant i picked my   package up off the porch i heard a rattling
i immediately thought the filters may have broken
but since there was other stuff on the box i decided to hold judgment
well it turns out it was the filters and they were not broken the just rattle a lot
so badly i heard it through the amazon box when i picked it up from the porch
the glass is too small for the frame significantly small not just a tiny bit
so you can immediately forget keeping dust out
i cleaned the inside off and put them on my lenses
next i sprayed some nikon lens cleaner on the outside surface and cleaned off the filters outside face got it all nice and clean only to find out some of the liquid ran inside the filter and onto the lens surface
so i had to take it off reclean the lens and try again what a fiasco i used the nikon lens cleaner high quality stuff to clean the filters
that stuff contains isopropyl alcohol so i know it can clean almost anything
no matter what there are spots that will not come off
they are embedded in the glass somehow the filters were filthy when i received them
i spent  minutes just cleaning them and was still unsuccesful
i used the nikon lens cleaner as well as a microfiber cloth didnt work
then i used a qtip instead
guess what
the qtip head was black after i cleaned off the filters
there was a greasy film and dirt all over both surfaces of both filters
and i still cannot get it all off the packaging they came in was poorthese are junk save your money and buy a better one
or go cheaper and at least expect to get a piece of junk and save yourself  eachi put this on my mm  it cost me around five bucks
i had been very happy with it until one day i suspected that all the ghosting glares and reflections of light sources on some photos might come from this filter
i do an experiment with a light source a lamp in the photo
yes the refection is in the photo
i can even see the reflection through viewfinder
i then swap it with a hoya hmc
the refection is gone
the reflection for sure is not there if i dont put any filter on
this filter does protect my lens well
but the whole purpose of the lens is to take quality pictures not to be cherished behind a glasstiffen filters of different sizes have been amazon best sellers
yes they fit well
the build quality is good
but you will be very sorry when you finally find that it is the cause of the glares ghosting and reflections
i believe tiffen has coated versions
but i didnt try themthe problem is not on the quality of the filters
they are simply not coated
but if i have to be mindful about what it might harm my photos when i take them in certain situations i cannot use themi know bw has good filters but they are expensive
i have been having good luck with hoya hmc
it is around twenty dollar range
very affordable
so my suggestion is dump this filter and go with that onei ordered the tiffen mm uv filter to use on a nikon mm fg
it didnt look all that bad but i immediately noticed increased flare and degraded sharpness in my pictures
it required a filter wrench to remove it from the lens because the mount is very soft and threads not quite machined right
after i removed the filter the glass was rattling loose in the ring
it is now in the trash bin
i purchased the bw mm uva ultra violet haze mrc filter  to replace iti gave this  stars instead of one only for the protection it adds to the front element of the lensthere is no advantage to screening uv from a digital sensor
one thing this filter will do is create double imaging of light sources in your shotgrossi was initially excited about this uv filter for my  canon l lens
its metal and came in a nice box
but the glass part feels cheap and produces glare and artifacts in low light conditions
no other uv filter has done that
currently seeking a new onemy experience with tiffen has been mixed
tiffen used to make quality filters but since it was bought a few years ago by an outfit called topspin they started cutting corners and quit multicoating their filters so like this uv filter they will cause ghosting  reflections on your pictures
they protect your lens ok but if your pix turn out bad whats the pointi bought this to protect my canon mm f ii lens
it does that no problem fits fine and looks ok too
the actual glass of the lens if very far away from this filter probably a bit less than an inch
this is just cuz of the construction of the lens
it does its job and its on there fine
my issue is that i took pictures at night with all the correct setting and it produced a glorious image being the good lens it is but i got several flares and glares ruining the image
i took the same picture with the same settings and got no glare at all
i will keep it on mainly because it protects my glass but i dont want to have to take it on and off to protect my images as welli gave it a bad review because of my lens it might not do this for youi got this filter to go on my tamron   vc
it arrived on june  and worked great for a while
about two weeks ago i was doing a shoot and pulled out my tamron
i took off the lens cap to find the filter was cracked in half
there was no damage to the outer ring the lens cap had been on and my camera bag is padded well
i have had no trouble with any other filters ive bought in the past and maybe this one had a defect no one caught
dont know what happened but now its in the trash
hope you have better luckdont buy cheap uv filters
i did for the same reasons youre looking at this oh itll protect the lens at least
useless when it flares everything you point it at
the flare doesnt look good either
dont bother
youll just find yourself making your current lenses look amateurthe metal ring is thicker than pictured 
install it before the lens change the looking of the camera
optical quality is so soi bought this filter from amazon and they have great customer service
i thought the filter was the wrong size so i contacted them and was immediately sent a replacementnow it turns out it was technically the right size but horribleness occurred with his filter
as a freelance photographer for my towns newspaper i am frequently shooting events and have damaged a lot of equipment doing so
i picked this filter because i thought it would protect the glass on my lens which it shouldi took this filter attached to my gear about two weeks after i bought it and went to work
within five minutes it fell off the front of my lens
thinking i hadnt screwed it on tight enough i reattached it and went on my way
not two minutes later it fell off again
needless to say this went on for the entire three hour assignmentthe truth it it sort of screws on then just pops right off within just a few minutes of movement
bummeri purchased this filter pack with high hopes
granted its a low end pack of three filters so i didnt expect world class optics
what i did expect is that id be able to use these filters out of the box without having to clean them
straight of the box they were covered in dust pieces of cardboard and in some cases even grease and fingerprints
literally you could have used the prints on one of the filters to convict someoneafter cleaning and drying with a very soft clean cloth i discovered a number of scratchesi contacted the company via email and a very nice very polite rep got back to me
wonderful service which is the only reason this review isnt a  star but unfortunately the second and then the third replacement they sent me were also filthy and scratched
on the first and second rounds the black filters actually had multiple dings in the metal revealing the underlying silver colorthe service rep told me each time that he had personally inspected the filters before sending them out
each time theyve arrived less than expected
the last time around he promised a nice gift i was sure to like
for a company who makes filters as a primary business i expected hed drop me an extra filter or two
instead he send me a garment bag marked from some photographers organization
very strangei finally gave up after round  im accepting them
lesson learned  dont buy tiffenout of the box one of filters had a defect of coating
like a underpainted blobthanks amazon for no hassle returnthe circular polarizer filter has very little filtering on reflections on glass water or the sky the uv filter i use as a lens protector and the other tinted filter has very little value on enhancement on light
i would not recomment this kitbought these for my nikon d about  months ago
never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation
vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse ive seen
build quality of all the filters is really not very good
going to go back to hoyas which are much better stars  since the polarizing filter was scratched upon receipt
didnt notice it until we were out on the water and i attempted to use iti have a lens filter tha tis a direct mm for my minolta  i can only take pix after extending the lens some
otherwise i have the ends of the filter lens in the picture
very sad for a  to  lens
it ruined some great shots too
well not ruined as in i cant use but not the full shot eitherjust a note about filters that i have come across
extend out  everything is fine
but can you rember to do that with every shot
me eitherhope you find this useful  get some great shotsi am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set
the finish of the rings are poor
despite of previously poor reputaion i recently purchased some mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters
i never got tiffens before had good experience with hoyas
i will probably stay with those from now on
now come to think of it ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoyathe glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays
not a good signthe circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after  sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off
quite frustrating
all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the boxthe set might be cheap but it sure is for a good reasoni bought this kit about a year ago
i was so excited about my new camera purchase that i wanted to make sure that i was prepared
please be warned that anything you put in front of your lens will degrade the image to some degree
the quality of what you put in front will determine the degree of that degradationwith that being said the uv filter in this package is garbage
it causes ghosting in images
ghostings is basically where you can see a ghosted image of a light right next to the original light source
this is an easy indication of a poorly made filterthe warming filter is pretty cool
being a caucasian in the winter isnt always the most pleasing of skin tones
its gimmicky thoughthe polarizer is decent
when stacked i sometimes have spots on the imagethe pouch is actually great
i use it to hold the warming filter my nd filters and the polarizerif you are just starting out trust me when i say that quantity in this hobby is not worth the sacrifice of quality
for the price you are better off buying a multicoated uv protector
save up and buy a polarizer later if you want
as your skills increase you will notice that you will quickly outgrow this kit rendering most of it useless
also make sure your buying the right size
that mm is very important happy picture takingin spite of the fairly positive reviews ive read here at amazon about these filters my experience differs
i returned the filters almost immediately after buying them
i was planning to use them the nikon mm f d af nikkor lens i use with a nikon d
i was planning to use the uv filter primarily for protection of the lens
however the filter glass is not multicoated to reduce reflection
from my perspective a filter  particularly a uv filter used to protect a pristine lens like my nikkor  is absolutely worthless underscore the word worthless if ive got to take it off the lens in the field in order to get a decent shot without reflection
as an aside i thought the tiffen filters looked and felt cheap
additionally they arrived somewhat smudged in their holder
not a problem  amazon allowed me to return them
in exchange i purchased a sigma multicoated uv filter which cost roughly 
beautiful glass great product no reflections
worth the price
nuff saidi received these filters covered with fingerprints and greasy smudges that to this day i was unable to clean completely
as other reviewers seem to have had the same issues i suspect this is a tiffen problem my package didnt seem used with poor manufacturingpackaging practicesthe filters themselves seem ok although the uv one creates all sorts of internal reflections with the front element of the lens
the polarizer is of good mechanical quality
have not used the neutral density much
however because of the smudges i doubt ill ever buy a tiffen filter againoff the bat i did not purchase this lens via amazoncom
however i offer this as general advise on the product alone
the lens strictly stating is an unbelievably shocking underperformer
shooting from aperature priority in all ranges to shutter priority the lens is simply poor quality
it never reaches reasonable looking sharp photos and ultimately fails in every catagory from color to chromatic abberation
though you could consider this a tough good first lens to learn with  except the fact that it may allude the first time dslrr to think something is wrong with their camera when its really the extremely poor optics of this tamron lens
i despise the canon mm as well but the verdict of sharpness and linear quality is unmistakableany alternative to this focal range is superior in all shots
i offer you to pass on this lens entirelybolim returning the filter because it wasnt the one i ordered
i ordered the cokin pseries grey nd filter for my psized filter holder and what i got instead was an asized smaller filter
if it was the one i ordered then no where in any part of this parts description does it indicate it is for the smaller sized filter system
the catalog needs to be explicit in which filter system a filter will fitmy husband purchased this in early  for a trip to africa
it worked well back then and it worked very well for our wedding in 
he hadnt really used it since africa though
since then we have used it very little maybe  hours worth of total video taping before we put it away for about  years until yesterday
ive been digitizing all our old home movies from vhs to dvd on a great little sony dvdirectpurchased through amazon
seeing that the camcorder will also work very nicely with the dvdirect mikes camera charges  for st hr and  per hour after to transfer tapes to dvd so the sony has saved us over  including the cost of the unit i was ready to see what was on the tapes and get them transferred our honeymoon is one we didnt transfer from the mini dvms yet
well its doing nothing but eating tapes
for  we can maybe get the capston cleaned but it will be another  to see if thats even the problem
from what im reading here it probably isnt the problem
i wouldnt recommend purchasing this for anyone
it ate  tapes that my husband was able to rewind ate about  of tape before he got it out on both tapes so were going to attempt to view them through another camcorder and see what we can do
im not going to attempt to clean this product or use it again
im just hoping that the  eaten tapes had videos we had already transferredi cant review this product i didnt have a chance to use it because of missing parts this product was not functionalthe majority of my cases were damaged in shipping
i immediately threw away about eight but as i tried to use the rest i gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well
maybe im alone given the other high ratings but these seem more fragile than other slim cases ive used in the past
id give them stars because theyre cheap if they didnt have to be shippedthe first thing i thought when i opened the box was quotwow this is tinyquotthe sound quality is good but the controls are awful
changing the volume requires several button presses
shuffle play is very flakyi had one song play  times in a row
ive also had the player quotlock upquot and require a power reset to get it playing againthe product is also marketed as a usb hard disksomething for which i have no need
however it does provide me with an inexpensive storage solution for all of my ripped cds which can be moved between my computers with easegiven short battery life flakey playback and difficult to use controls
im not sure where this product is most appropriate
its cute though so i continue to play around with it but i certainly could live without itmany things about the archos jukebox are terrific
its cheap the usb hard drive approach makes it easy to load music on the thing and the sheer concept of a hard drive based mp player is great
but the archos units are flaky and consumers should definitely look at other brandsthe biggest problem is the jukebox has a habit of randomly losing all its data forcing the user to reformat the hard drive
this happens to a lot of people and its unacceptableother problems the buttons are cheaply made playlist support is poor playback randomly skips etc
for more info see the archives of the ajb mailing listoverall i like my archos mp player but mostly because this product category is so great
i wish id bought some other brand that wasnt so flakyi read the reviews here but hoped that by december yamaha would have resolved the firmware bugs that are causing the drive to not work well on many systems
well not yet i got a build from november  downloaded the december firmware update and the adaptec software update but at least on my win system the drive had problems reading some cds including  of the  software cds that came with the drive would spontaneously quotunplugquot itself and could not write a cd
this was not a problem with the ide settings or dma
so best to wait for another firmware update unless youre prepared to take a chance
i returned it and am very happy with the replacement a plextor  weeks after i wrote this review i no longer can not copy and birce cdsits like clock workit was good till it lastedi guess i let my expectations of these speakers race ahead of my pocketbook
yes they are clear and crisp in the higher range and yes the bass is nice and you can get it thumping but the treble seems tinny and the midrange just plain missing
they lack the depth and soul i was hoping for
my old  labtecs werent all that bad it only works in low light because the suns rays interfere with the infrared sensor
you have to be in front of the camera and at close rangei bought this wirelessremote control and it is soooo much better for wildlife micro sunsets and fireworks or anything you want to shoot but cant be touching the camera  httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkdxqlarefcmcrrypprdttlsoli am using this remote with the evolt e dslrfor the price
not worth it poor range and delayed reaction time was annoying
although there is no other option for the model of camera i own
if youre looking for sustained exposure time itll do the trick
anything more than that dont expect muchits does what it is suppose to
sadly one of the led on my strip just died out and still i have got no response from the seller to assist me with iti used to buy a pack of envelopes from walgreens for about five bucks
the envelopes were fine worked well enough and as a bit more sturdy than these
these are super thin and do not seem like theyd offer a lot of protection
my recommendation is to skip these and find the thicker color envelopes maxell puts outi didnt think i could connect my old reliable hp n laserjet printer with its parallel printer port through a usb port
i didnt expect this to work
i was wrong
it worked perfectly
it autoinstalled the printer
fyi i run a gateway  bit laptop running windows   no problemsupdate    it just plain quit working after operating flawlessly all this time since my first review
i cant get it to work again
i checked the printer itself with its old parallel cable from an old  bit vista machine
the printer works perfectlynow i understand why such a large minority gave this cable  star saying it didnt work for their situation
somewhere there is an obscure incompatibility problem that rears its ugly head intermittently
reliability isnt therei feel certain the problem exists somewhere in either the updated driver software or the old parallel driver software
some bit or flag or something is causing the print command to be totally ignored across this cable
this cabled didnt simply break
there is a compatibility flaw somewherein the meantime i am forced to save my print jobs on my win  bit machine into a pdf file that my vista machine on the same network can read and print fromthe connector does not fit my printer
the pin numbers are correct but physical size is larger than my connectionwindows xpokipage ex printeri replaced a dying computer with one that did not have a parallel port
i wanted to be able to use my okipage ex printer and so i bought this because it acted as the printer cable as well as a converterthe cable comes in one of those hard to open seal hard plastic containers
installing was easy  just connect to the printer and insert in a usb port
windows xp asked to a disk or a driver and i selected okidata from the list of manufactures and ex as the printer typeunfortunately printing is erratic
the printed document sits in the printers queue even though xp says the printer is ready
to get it to print i have to turn the printer off and then on
the first page comes out with just an e in the top left corner then the document printsthe windows diagnostics wont run because they expect  the printer to be on an lptx port not a usb portthe instruction booklet that came with the printer says there is supposed to be a cd in the package  there wasnt any
the cd is only for windows  so i guess the manufacturer stopped putting it in but didnt update the documentationif you do a lot of printing stay away from this cable unless  you have a second working printer
if you only need to print an email every now and then this cable is fine  as long as you dont mind wasting paperthis bracket made in japan and costing close to  in camera stores is not what i expected from olympus
the problem is with the grip
it is a type of textured tape that is wrapped around a tube made of metal
this is the part where you grab it
the tape was peeling off along the seem and each time i picked it up i could feel the glue sticking to my hand
really cheapo design
i managed to fix this by removing the textured tape and glue and replacing it with a foam grip made for bicycle speed handlebars
the replacement foam grip was hard to get over the metal tube as the tube is larger diameter than a bike handlebar but i got it on there
it now is working just fine and even looks factory
this is not a bad review on amazon or the sellers part
it is olympus quality is seriously lacking for such a costly piece of equipmentthe bracket isnt terrible but it was a waste of money for me
it throws shadows on the wall to the left of my subject because it positions the flash to the left of the lens rather than directly above the lens where it should be
yeah the flash is placed higher but i think the drawback of the shadows it creates by being to the left of the lens is actually worse than redeye
you can at least fix redeye
i didnt realize how much of a problem shadows would be until i boughtused this thing
this was just a bad purchase
ill be buying a new flash bracket at some point and throwing this one away
ill need a hotshoe cable for any other bracket so the cable that i bought with this bracket was a waste of money too
live and learnone good thing i can say about this bracket is that it allows you to remove the handle and manually holdposition the flash away from the camera
thats nice i guess
its a pain in the a to screw the thing on and off though
it should have had a simpler lockingunlocking mechanismmy advice to others would be to save up for a proper flash bracket and a hotshoe cable
like me you may find that this bracket creates more problems than it solves and you may wind up having to buy a different one
so get it right the first time
dont make my mistakei bought the tripplite isobar specifically to filter rf interference from a treadmill
any time someone uses my treadmill our computer network speeds drop to almost nothing
i was able to filter out this interference successfully with a monster hts
when the unit dies after  years i bought a series of power strips with various filtering capabilities
despite previous reviews stating that the isobars would filter out the specific interference caused by a treadmill i found that it did not work for me
i finally found that the monoprice power center worked thoughthis cable has served me well no data loss and the length is perfect for what i used it for on that note the device end wore out prematurely causing it to be loose and sometimes lose connectionthe problem here is that in any group of  outlets  or many outlets there are bound to be some of them that are for those power bricks and the receptacles on this are arranged longitudinally  so that power bricks will not really work well with it  which makes it useless for what i want to do with it which is charge lots of things on my work bench
it seems just silly to do that and obvious not toive ordered a few of these in different sizes
theyre really nice
biggest problem is only some of them come with mounting clips
several of the strips ive ordered including this one have been missing it
vendor isnt responsive to emailstwo words disk roti am out of ideas on keeping my floppy collection going i dont know if its because of bad drives or if in fact floppys left in the supply chain are just  years oldi needed a cheap microphone for a spanish class im taking
i yell into it when it is almost touching my lips and it still barley hears what im saying
maybe it will work if you attach it to your tonsils
i bought this one and another brand for the same price around  just in case one of them didnt work
neither of them are any goodive switched back and forth between the two and i cant tell the difference
im going to have to buy another more expensive one
i will copy and paste this review to the other microphone since they seem to be identical quality and almost identical price
if you need one on a regular basis spend more to get a decent onethese are frustratingmaybe it would work better with a different writer
audio had a buzzing and the voices are in a fog
maybe it will work with some other gadget
at least i didnt spend a tonif you look at the picture closely you will notice that this is not an actual  pin cable
i needed it for a  pin application not as a typical vga cable
the pin its missing makes it completely worthless for my needs
be careful if you need a full  pin setupthe plus side of the microphone is that it does swivel at all angles
the down side is you have to practically have the microphone in your mouth in order for it to pick up sounds
its cheap and not really functional for me
wouldnt recommend itseemed the only nonwater way to cool my video card was one of these slot based ones
this one was made by a reputable company and looked well constructed so i purchased it around  months agoit started out well enough easy to install and dropped video card temps around  degrees c under full load
not great but not bad for the price
then after a couple weeks it started to make terrible noises
cleaned it out with no love
found that if i jammed some paper under a corner and supported it from the bottom of the case i could reduce the noise
this was a temporary solution as it eventually vibrates its way into making the noises again
just not built solidly enough to handle the constant vibration no matter tightly you screw it into the slotthen came the smells
my wife described it best as dentists office smell and this came after a month and periodically since then
i have not isolated it due to temps or vibration but it definately has something burningshorting in it every once and a whilethere are better solutions out there would not recommend this productfew days on and already making noiseit was quiet at day  but i could already hear it the next dayits quiet noisy if u ask me
i wish i could post a video for you to hear it
but even video wont be enoughthis sucker  broke  straight off when installed  the  metal pice came right off otherwise  i would write  something more though  it arrived  on timethis thing is a dust trap so no matter what it will eventually go sideways after a while
it was already pretty loud to begin with but bearable for a while
then it became louder and louder until i had to pull it outim honestly not sure if it did anything at all the temperatures in my case didnt get better when i installed it and they didnt get hotter when i removed iti would just save your money and get some vented pc slot covers if you just want a little better coolingi cant remember what i did with this i dont remember if i returned this or left it in an old computerwhich leads me to believe it wasnt good enough to move to my current configloud the air moving is what makes it so loud
if you have a computer that you dont care about sound then this is the perfect thing for you
it moves air faster than any other fan i have
but its sooo loudworked ok when we first installed it solid air flow although rather loud
it did help the video card temp with about a  degree reduction
but the noise kept getting worse until it was really annoying especially on startup
it didnt get clogged with dust as i keep the machine and fans blown out it was just the bearing wearing out
purchased in sep  totally dead in may  typical cheap crap
ill be buying a more expensive one to replace it hope the next one lasts longerit works but it does not move as much air as i thought it would
i wish every type of fan included cfms in their information
it is usable and does what it should but i do not use it anymorethe unit worked great to cool down the video card sitting next to it in the pci slot however it lasted less than two years
disappointingi thought these would be an easy fix for a hot running compaq computer but alas they got more and more noisier with usenot a quality itembeing in the computer industry since the start of compaq i have sold a lot of antec products
just recently built a intel i computer and just wanted a decent blower for secondary exhaust and picked up two of theseworks as i expected but i was very disappointed on the pin male molex connection poorly fastened and when connecting it to the power supply female molex connection the pins was slipping out from the back and was very loose 
had to reinsert and align it to match the female side
that is why i gave this a stari bought this product in december  and it was working great i used it for my video card but after six months of use it started to make a big noise due to dust accumulation and the rpms reduced notably
it stopped working after seven months of use
i have a vantec pci fan in other pc and have been working for over two years and no problemstried to clean this fan but it come in a sealed case so it is not possible
really did not like this product
really short lifetimemakes too much noise at this point so removed itdespite the windows vista compatibility logos on the startech website  other reviews here this card would not install properly on my fujitsu laptop running vista businessoddly i could still plug in and readwrite to my external hdd but other functionality was busted  it kept trying to find the card drivers
there are none available from the startech website
their tech support was quick to respond but unable to solve the problem
apparently the drivers should be included in windows xp and vista but werent on my systemthere are cheaper alternatives wboth a firewire  and the newer b firewire  that hopefully will work out better
returning this for another optionthe cable did not work with my legacy hp laserjet l in a windows  new installation
had to return itthis worked well for the application but the batteries just kept on dieing in the remote
if they had a larger remote with aaa batteries i would have given it a i bought two of these and the first one works great
i hear it click when the air conditioning turns on so i know it is protecting my equipmentthe second one emits a constant hum regardless of whether anything is plugged in
in a noisy room you probably wont hear it but it is noticeable in a quiet room with the tv off
i was all set to install half a dozen of these around the house but i cant take the chance that they will develop a hum either now or later
i kept the first which i run in the basement and i will return the secondaside from the hum the tripp lite appears to be well made and i own plenty of other tripp lite products which have all been great
it is a brand that i trusti also own two apc le  line conditioners and they are silent
the tripp lite has more features but silent operation is key for something that must run in the living roomfirst let me say that ive been buying tripp lite products for nearly  years in fact i have another lc that i bought new in    years ago
though the model number was the same the design was very different thenthe problem with any sort of power protection device is that unless you have the right equipment to measure what it actually does and you have the time to perform such tests you dont really know how well protected you are
many people sing the praises of this or that line conditioner this or that ups etc
 but until something happens with their power they dont really knowhaving said that i recently bought a very high end hdtv and was interested in protecting it mostly from brownouts that we sometimes have here usually during severe storm season us midwest
the candidates for this included the lc and an apc ups model brg
there were other candidates but ill leave those out since i dropped them off the list for completely unrelated reasons and never did test thembefore buying anything i contacted the tech support departments of both tripp lite and apc in order to find out how much voltage correction these units were capable of providing
frankly the contact with tripp lite was what i had come to expect a human being speaking english based in the us and willing to at least try to answer every question i had
the contact with apc turned out to be an email from india and it took two tries before any meaningful information came forth from themso the lc and the apc ups both arrived
i do want to say that my test results are based on the assumption that i did not get a defective unit
its always possible that mine was defective but im not interested in spending any more time messing with thistripp lite had told me that during a brownout condition the lc should boost output voltage up to nearly v if input dropped to as low as around v
most importantly they said that if input voltage dropped to the point where the unit couldnt boost the voltage back to useable levels it would instantly and cleanly shut off output completely so as to not subject the connected equipment to a severe undervoltage conditioni connected the lc to a variac a device which allows you to control the amount of ac voltage supplied
i used a fluke dvm to monitor the voltage supplied by the variac so that i could be sure of the points at which the lcs behavior changed
ill point out that in one of my calls with tripp lite they suggested that i use a variac if i wanted to be certain about the units performancestarting at v from the variac and slowly dropping the voltage the lc reported the line voltage as low when the voltage dropped to v and it boosted the output from the lc to v
very nice
it reported the line voltage as very low when the voltage got down to v and output from the lc remained at v
again this is just what id expectthe problem lies in the fact that as line voltage continued to drop as it easily could during a brownout the lc never did shut off the output
as line voltage dropped to v the lc was still outputting v
as i continued to drop the line voltage the output from the lc simply continued to drop all the way down to less than v
that was all i needed to see on the lc and its in the process of being returnedi went through the same process with the apc ups
its not a magic bullet either its automatic voltage regulation function similar at least in concept to what the lc uses will allow the connected equipment to see voltage as low as about v during a brownout and as high as v during an overvoltage condition before it switches to battery  which then provides v for as long as the battery can hold out
the difference is it has a battery to switch to and doesnt attempt to keep boosting or trimming voltage no matter how low or high the line voltage goesdont get me wrong  a line conditioner and a ups are two completely different animals intended for different applications
the reason im comparing them is that they both provide and their advertising makes a big point of automatic voltage regulation in order to protect connected equipment from undervoltages and overvoltages
my new tv doesnt need to stay on during a storm therefore i have no need for a ups per se  but i do want it protected from wild variations in voltage and it seems that in order to get this i need the additional functionality of a ups
you might need it too if youre considering the purchase of a line conditionerim laying out the data here so that you can make a more informed decision
i may buy another lc in the future but it wont be to protect anything from brownouts
if you arent concerned with brownouts and only want to stabilize your line voltage which is already assumed to be within a reasonable range the lc can do a fine job
but the one i received does not perform as tripp lites tech support department said it would and its a long way from performing to the level implied by their advertising in my opinioninside the box is an unattached plug that will not fit a standard usa household outlet
when we first saw this plug we assumed it was for a nonusa outlet
but the literature inside the box states that for  amp protection to work this plug must be installed and then plugged into a special outlet on a dedicated circuitwhy they dont explain this in the product description on the website or amazon
sales of course
bad showwe would not have bought this knowing it will not provide the advertised  amp rating without hiring an electrician to rewire a dedicated circuit and otherwise unusable outlet
not recommendedexcellent noise reductiontight fit get loose with time or on a book overnightless than mediocre sound quality
no lows at all lacks volumei have a suunto tc and like the watch so i thought i would like this  too
i was soo disappointed in the watchs looks
i opened the sweet looking box and saw this lump of plastic looking at me and i put it right back in the box
i knew i was going to return it next day
well as it sat on the table it kept saying dude come over here and at least try me on i will look better on your arm
my curiosity gave in and i went and tried it on
now its just a big lump of plastic on my arm
i went to print out the amazon forms and saw i would eat a ish charge and i hate to waste money
so i said maybe watch isnt so bad
i went over and looked at it again and even took it to my chick and asked her about it
i told myself if she said it was ok i would keep it and i figured it would grow on me
she agreed it sucked hard so i ate the ish charge
but at least i dont have an ugly watch onif you were wondering what i expected from this watch i expected a metal bezel
even the back is plastici bought this router about a year ago
it looks nice and sets up easily and would be a strong recommendif it would continue working properlyafter only a few months i started noticing the occasional internet access outage
never even really thought about it
then it grew progressively worse up to  or  times a day
not being a network guru its taken quite a bit of time and effort to trace the problem back to the router
linksys tech support didnt even answer my emails and phone support is now a  numberdont buy this product unless you hate yourself and enjoy having your internet access fail whenever you seem to need it mostive owned a couple of these and for some reason they just stop working after a few years
nothing you can do to fix it except replace it
it works fine while it lasts though for    years or soi got this router two years ago and used it to share my dsl connection among my computers
setting it up was very easy
i did get disconnected once or twice a week but i never investigated if it was the router or my dsl provider who dropped the connection
now its been two years and the dreaded diag light went solid red the other day
i contacted linksys tech support through online chat from their web site and got a quick response
unfortunatly they told me the router is broken and there is nothing they can do
easy installation low price good tech support but possibly dropped connections and limited lifespan  that comes out at two stars in my booki bought mine at a local micro center
i wish id looked here first
the linksys was easy to set up and would probably work fine for  percent of people
i also like the fact that this is not an b base station
i prefer to have the security option of unplugging the wireless base station and therefore it needs to be a separate physical boxwhat about those  percent of users who wont like this product
if you like to keep tcp connections open for a long time eg if youre a developer using ssh or telnet this linksys is problematic
my old smc router after upgrading the firmware was rock solid and i could keep an emacs up and running on a remote server for days or weeks
with the linksys connections will mysteriously die
i havent changed my cable modem or my cable servicepurchases a dlink di access point and dlink dwl pcmcia card
the ap works great but the pcmcia first did not establish a connection for my dell laptop with win xp on it
tech support spent hrs with me trying to resolve but was unable to
i then tried to install on my other dell laptop with nt and now the pcmcia port on that laptop is toast
not a great track record for software and driver installations but their support is very helpful and their hardware seems well made
stick with an  intel or linksys pcmcia  which may cost more but cause less griefas of this writing there is no microsoft approved windows xp driver
dlink claims that the unapproved driver will work but in my experience it didnt
the control panel shows it connected and it seems to send packets but not receive them
in fact after i installed the driver for the card dhcp stopped working properly on my baset cards ip stack
in fact even after uninstalling the driver dhcp is still broken
not sure whats going on but i suspect this cards uncertified drivers have something to do with itif youre running xp i recommend before buying an  card that you check the vendors website to see if their techsupport says something like quotwindows will warn you that this driver might make your system unstable
but dont worry about that
everything will work out just finequotyeahthis product did not work with my computer
i installed the program from the ti website tried plugging in the calculator to the computer and it said it was incompatible with my os
xp  its a pity because i really would have liked to be able to update my calculator via computeri should have known when i bought a mpcd player from a manufacturer of audiocassettes for dollar amount it would be kinda chincy well thats what it is
dont get me wrong for the price you cant find a mpcd player that has more features and accessories but dont expect quality workmanship
i bought the memorex for a trip to vegas so i could have music in my room while i was there and if it survived that i would use it in the gym so i was not expecting anything amazing
my biggest problems with this unit is that even sitting still it skips on the smallest smudge or scratch on your cds
i do have to say that the esp works well if the unit is being jolted but small imperfections on a cd can make it skip like a yearold girl
one of my favorite things about the cd player is the title artist and album listing on the screen
when you put a cd of mps in the title and artist scroll on the screen
its a little hard to read and its not back lit but what do ya want
it cost dollar amount
i also love the song titleartist search feature
when you have over  mps on a cd and you are looking for viva las vegas at am after a hard day of drinks gambling and drinking did i mention drinking
 its a little hard to remember track numbers so this can be very handy
memorex was also kind enough to include a car kit cassette adaptor  cigarette lighter power adaptor the power adaptor is huge so watch out if your lighter is in a tight spot and a home power plug
everything a boy could want
so basically if you want a really cheap mpcp player that will last about six months this is the one for you but if you are looking for one to last you a long time year  look elsewherei bought this from amazon and i am sorry to say that this unit did not perform as expected
it skips mp songs at random
it is not that it skipped because it was subjected to shock but it skipped at random
it does not have support for lower bit rate mp files and does not support vbr that quite well the unit lacks proffessional design as in expanium from philips
this unit does have some plus points like better lcd display and id tag display to track file names in alphanumeric characters but overall this unit did not perform well it is cheap and this unit requires some serious design changes may be some firmware problem
for random skipping
the sound quality is okay
i can rate this with  stars
wait for better mp players if you have the money and urge to buy something that plays does not skip then buy expanium from philips and buy yourself a good headphones too as expaniums headphones are crap
buy headphones from koss sportapro the ideal headphones for this unitcheersthe mpdcp seemed to work ok when i tested it inside albeit with a few skips here and there
unfortunately when i tried it in the car the skips grew much more frequent
even during smooth highway driving i could expect a skip in almost every song
inclines in the road seemed to cause the player even more problems
i might have kept it if i was planning to use it in the house instead of the car but i returned it since car performance was my main concern
the mpdcp soured me on cdbased mp players so i decided to go with the nomad jukebox instead
the nomad jukebox isnt that much more expensive than the better cdbased mp players anywayim a total amateur using binoculars so it took me some time to get used to focus clearly however i quickly discovered that focusing shouldnt be so hard and then realized that the product had a defect in one of the objectives
it was twisted a little bit to the left so it always made hard to visualize correctly and you needed to give some space between your eyes and the binosi really dont recommend the productbuying these are like buying a cheap bike
theyll probably stay in your drawer and quash any interest you have in either viewing celestial or terrestrial or in some cases telestial objects
in short these binocs will probably last at least a  lifetime because theyre so poor in rendering a respectable image
seriously buy a nikon
you wont regret it
also if the people who gave these binocs a good review knew what they were buying they wouldnt be buying entry level bushnell binocsthere are so many things going on when binoculars are focusing an image things like chromatic aberration
colors focus at slightly different points and a good lens has to bring them all together into one crisp image
the best way to see what im talking about is by picking up a pair of these binocs and then comparing them directly with a decent pair
now please realize even nikon isnt considered great just decent
to get great optics plan on spending six or seven hundred clams and more than a grand for superphoto quality optics
but as with bicycles and everything else there is usually a point of diminishing marginal return somewhere along the way
the basic rule of thumb is to not to buy cheap
if your binocs have busrubycoated lenses run dont walk away from them
these bushnells arent that bad but your eyes deserve crisp contrasty images and with these binocs youll find yourself first focusing and then refocusing vainly trying to find that sweet spot of clarity that never comes
so what are you doing still reading this
point your mouse to a nikon or try to find a pair of these used
you should be able to find them cheapthe binocular assembly was sloppy and shows a lack of care and review of the final productone of the lenses was not screwed in correctly and in another there was a loose prism
both problems were easy to solve with a small screwdriver and screwing the lens in place but this shows a lack of diligence in assemblyseveral years ago i bought a pair of bushnell x binoculars and to this day they are amazing
so when it was time to buy a pair for a family member  i decided to buy another pair of bushnell x
unfortunately i did not understand the specs of binoculars and the field of view of the new pair is much much smaller than the old pair
i also noticed that the new pair were made in china and the old were made in the phillipines
maybe the manufacturing differences between the factories has something to do with itanyway i highly recommend trying the binoculars of choice at a store and then order
do not go by the specsi bought these thinking they would be a good investment
i dont use them very often so i thought they would last a long time
they broke where the zoom feature is
i am bummedthese binoculars arent the quality that bushnell claimsi cant get them to focus clearlynot very happy with this purchasethe binocular came with left lens crack on the outside plasticrubber and bent inward a little bit
seems like assembly defect
it is still usable but hard to see using two eyes
i have requested a replacement and hope the next one is normalmy router was having problems with disconnecting
it is not smart enough to reestablish its dhcp when its lease expires and it often loses track of the isp dns connection
i called tech support and was told after  mins on hold to load new firmware using instructions on the web site i did just that
the firmware didnt load correctly and the router gives a signature error and hangs
i called back tech support after  min
was told i was in the wrong queue and put in another queue for  minutes more
the support engineer was rude told me that the information i was giving him was wrong and said hed email me a file in  minutes that would tell me how to fix the problem he denied that there was no way to get the router to let me ftp in a new update but well see about that
the file never showed up
i called back tech support and waited on hold for another  minutes and gave up
i sent them an email asking for help and have received no response
really really bad supporti have been using this lens for about  month
once my extensive research was completed i pulled the trigger and purchased the lens
unfortunately i do not understand what people are raving about
for portraits on my d mark i much prefer a simplecanon ef mm f usm medium telephoto lens for canon slr camerasfor less than half the price
however the lens that eventually replaced this wascanon ef mm fl is usm to macro lens for canon digital slr cameras for about the same price
i really like tack sharp resolution and both of the lenses i kept do just that with a great bokeh in my opinion
i think that this is probably just an old design which just does not keep up with the nicer digital sensors
it may be ok on some smaller and older apsc sensors but i just do not like the sharpness especially that it missed way too many times for me
i gave this lens as much time as i could but in the end i am much happier with the other two lenses which serve me very well
and in the end you could probably stop it down to f and i think the sharpness will get pretty good but then why am i paying for an f which by the way mm macro does tack sharp at f with beautiful bokeh but it is a much newer lens design editupon reading the comments here i have given this lens a few more chances
here is what i have found there was a user error and i was asking this lens to do what it was not designed to do
namely i used it to close near its mfd which it does poorly  especially on my d m  i was demanding exceptional sharpness wide open
not on a  lensbarring these two i find this lens a great choice for some situations
namely if you want a lens similar to canon  f is ii but with half the weight and half the size and black stealth vs white glare i find this lens very useful
if i have to shoot in the dark at  i just accept the sharpness loss
in the day i use it between  and  and as long as i dont have to have the zoom it saves me lots of weight and size as well as its much more stealthy
yes the build quality is very good but filter size sucks
though i think the new  m will be the same size
so in conclusion this is a very old design and looses in many ways to the newer sexier designs
however for the money and certain situations this is a great lens to own and carryi was very excited to receive this lens after reading the reviews here at amazon
however my disappointment was big as i didnt notice better image quality compared to my beloved canon  lens
also the mm zoom is barely better than the  zoom
and im not able to shoot any people that are standing close to me
this requires a constant change of lenses which is a real hassle
for this price this lens doesnt deliver much satisfaction
the  lens is way better comes with an image stabilizer awesome sharp pictures and is much shorter therefore easier to carry around
ill return the l lensi was very disappointed with this lens
it has a very cheap feel and the image quality was terrible
i was only able to test it with my canon d and not with film
i couldnt believe how lousy it was i had read some other reviews and they seemed positive
i tried it on a tripod and shot a variety of things text and d objects and never could pull a sharp photo
i noticed that i had to use a lot more unsharp mask than normal to be useable
i tend to use primes a lot and so maybe i expected to muchthis device only gives the outgoing message if you press the button
it has no memory and so if they call again you have to press the button again
dishonest and criminal callers will not be put off by this
they will continue calling
one called five times a day for many daysproduct seems to be ok but if you run into any trouble forget about it
dlink tech support is clueless
they cant speak english and they have no knowledge of their own products much less basic networking
i bought a dlink p wireless routeralong with this product
tech support could not even tell me what one of the two products was at fault
im returning both items and im getting a linksys router and nic
you get what you pay for and i recommend you pay a little extra for another wireless brandi had hoped to have no problems with these brand new tapes but  out of the  that i bought so far are depressing me with the video playback
i dont understand how it can record the show clearly but the playback is scratchy with the tracking issues that wont stop even though im pressing the tracking button on the remote like crazy
i had began to think that my  year old vcr was going to the deep end but then i put another tape that i previously had taped a million times on and it played great immediately after taking the new maxell hours tape out of the machine
i examined the maxell s and i noticed that the tape tends to be not as tight as it should be and even if i attempt to tighten it after a few short minutes of playback the tracking issues start againoh well its all understandable that videocassettes are being made to the greatest of perfection or value these days
i was basically shocked that i could still purchase them without paying too much
i guess ill find the sweet spots on the tapes and only record and watch from that portion of it
i do own a dvd recorder but i still love to record on my vcr
i cant let it go not yeti had these headphones for maybe a couple of years before they died
after owning several other cheap headphones and a couple much more expensive sets of headphones i can say that these are good for budget headphones i think i picked mine up at target for  in 
the independent volume controls for each ear were nice although the feature was more a novelty than a necessity
i really liked that the cord only attached to one side then was connected to the other can via a wire across the headband and speaking of the headband it was fairly comfortable
i thought they sounded better than a friends  sony headphones and they were more comfortable than any other headphones i had previously owned
there were only two things that i didnt like
although they appear at first glance to be closedback headphones they actually are not sealed so they dont block any ambient noise
but more importantly despite my careful handling one side stopped working after a while making the headphones practically uselessthe sound quality is decent but i had problems with sweat on the earpads also it sits rather firmly so i couldnt wear it for longer than an hour at one time
also the plastic support for the sliding frame chipped in a few weeks i patched it up with tape but a bigger piece broke again so the headphones were effectively ruined
theres a reason why its on clearance clearly its not worth the full price build quality comfort
i will probably try a sennheiser the next time roundone reason to buy circumnaural around the ear headphones is to reduce environmental soundthese headphones block nothing at allnothing
i can hear the environment just as easily as if they were not onotherwise adequate for the pricenothing specialthose of you who have read my reviews have probably noticed that i dont write too many negative opinions
in general i am a careful shopper
i like to research read reviews and just do my homework before making a purchase
occasionally however i do make spontaneous buys
unfortunately i generally find myself getting burned on these occasions
alas my purchase of the linksys wpc instant wireless network pc card was no exceptiona wireless lan excursioni bought my wpc along with the linksys befws
the wpc is a pcmcia card for your laptop that enables wireless local area networking
the befws is a wireless access point dsl router and port switch combo
both devices use the increasing popular b wireless networking standard
wireless networking in general is a fast moving field with a number of competing standards and a whole new set of technical terms
however in the interests of brevity i will save a discussion of the ins and outs of wireless networking for my forthcoming review of the befwswere all the same on the insidethe guts of the wpc were designed by intersil corporation and use their secondgeneration prism chip set
the prism ii is pretty much the industry standard and is used in products by linksys dlink smc cisco and others
there is actually not much fault i can find with the prism ii
rather there is one major implementation flaw in the wpc that severely handicaps it in comparison with its competitionlets talk about the not so bad firstfirst let me cover the good features of the wpc
overall the build quality of the card is sound
the card itself is sturdy and solid and gives off an impression of durability
when inserted into a pc card slot on a laptop there is about a oneinch long portion of the card that remains exposed
there are two indication lights on portion
one is amber and indicates signal quality
a solid light means a solid signal
a flashing light means a lost signal
the other light is green and flashes during network activity
having two separate indicators is a nice convenience
i find a single indicator light to be of marginal usethe wpc comes with drivers for all flavors of windows
installation is simple and painless
you run the setup executable wait for it to complete restart your computer and voila you are good to go
actually you are almost good to go
you also need to install the configuration software
the config software is well done in my opinion
the software runs in the background and can be accessed via a task tray icon
the icon changes depending on signal strength so a quick glance into the lower corner of your screen can tell you if youre connected or not
clicking on the icon opens a window that allows you to quickly configure the wpc
you can set up your network properties and encryption
the wpc allows for both bit and bit wep encryption
the menus read bit but its actually bit encryption its just a difference in convention
the configuration utility also has measures realtime link quality and signal strength making it easy to test the range of your wireless networkand now comes the uglythis is where the wpc really falters
the range of the wpc is very very poor
it is by far the worst of any wireless lan card that i have had experience with
other reviews have mentioned a poor antenna design and i am inclined to believe this is true
as i stated earlier a number of manufacturers use intersils prism chip set
the only real variation from manufacturer to manufacturer is in the build quality and the antenna
and apparently linksys chose to use a very poor antenna design that severely cripples the range of the card
a friend of mine has a laptop with a builtin wireless lan card based off of a firstgeneration chip set that has easily twice the range of my wpcbe a smart shopperthe glaring lack of range is the only real fault i find with the wpc but it is a very severe handicap
a quick scan of the prices of various wireless networking cards shows all the major brands to be within  of each other
so buying the wpc was basically me purchasing a lesser product for the same price as a better product
if youre looking to set up a wireless network look past the linksys wpc
though i havent tried it myself ive heard particularly good things about lucent technologies wavelan pc card
regardless there are at least a half dozen alternatives to the wpc a sad reminder to myself to do my homework and stay away from impulse purchasesive bought a lot of linksys products over time and always liked them
this is an exceptionfirst the installation problem the drivers it ships with dont work with windows me
neither do the ones that you can download from the linksys web site
i managed to get a copy of the me drivers from alex who wrote an earlier review of this product and had similar problems  somehow he managed to get them to me faster than linksyswith the drivers from alex the product installed and worked correctly  provided it was within line of sight of my befws
the signal degradation got really bad after that and since i wanted to use the card to use my computer in my bedroom  feet and  stick and drywall wall away the  signal strength did not cut iti returned it and ordered a lucent orinoco card
i bet it will work better and install more easilyinstalled almost flawlessly
range stunk though so i returned it and bought a lucent orinoco which has awesome rangei like my linksys equipment
but in my cinder block hawaiian house the wireless hub is on one end and not more than  feet away i cant reach the dining room table or the kitchen where i prefer to watch movies stored on my linux machinei even got past the problems with the xp install and it works like a charm sitting right by the hubthis card needs some more boostive used this product with an b linksys access point for almost a year
my laptop would sometimes freeze such that i had to perform a hard reset remove all power including battery  very frustrating
it was easy to demonstrate this phenomenon by attempting to transfer a file larger than mb
signal strength might effect frequency but freezeing still occurs at the best strength
in my opinion this product is not a practical network device
ive since returned to using ethernet cable  of the time
my advice is to spend more for products that work well we use b at work  no problem or wait for the technology to maturethese were the headphones i  longed for for more than  years
i felt connected to koss so  i was electro estatic when it arrived
but this soon turned into agony when i found out the front part of the amp had scratches all over on the front face and two careless razor nicks where the amp had cut outs for switches etc
note i ordered these phones direct from the factory after what i suspect were used ones i had been receiving elsewhere despite being advertised as new
these were brand new and the leather bag had a pleasant leather smell that permeated for days in my room and the black box it came in was not creased all over like others i had received
the previous esps were not like thiscalling koss was a great shock
the customer service lady kept referring to the scratches sarcastically as smudges and basically refuted what i was saying even though i had the evidence right in my hand
i could not wipe it off with anything including with mild solution
i thought being their most expensive audiophile product i would get better service from koss but no you are treated like you are trying to rip them offthe scratches could easily be seen when light was angled on it
i decided to return it to their famous lifetime warranty service and hoped they would just give me another brand new one
in fact i offered them to just send me a faceplate and i would replace it myself as the esp seemed to be brand new i didnt want to let go of it based on my previous experiences but they said no
i began to have a bad feeling about this and reluctantly packed it up and sent it backi sent the entire unit back per their instructions and received an amp that had no scratches on it back but minus the factory plastic protective bag and the manual that was sent with it
the worst part was the right earpad i cannot tell if it was the original or not began to make a static soundi decided at paying so much for the esp that this should not happen and  the cost of returning and sending them back was getting too prohibitive
it cost me a total of  bucks and to take another chance at their crack lifetime warranty repair staff was something i was not going to do twice
maybe this time they will make it perfect and the left earpad will start making a static sound to match the right and there goes another  plus a another lifetime warranty repair fee added
well they say the rd time is the charm
probably the koss repair department has that engraved on their front wallto my surprise i received my refund minus the free shipping cost they offered
i complained to koss to refund my entire cost as the esp was defective on their part and their famed lifetime warranty service made it worse from defective to unusable
they refunded my total cost only after i threatened them to take it up the chainquality control or reliability is another issue as i found out some supposedly new esp phones sound different from each other especially in the bass area or have cosmetic flaws gold rusting on the logos or the earpads are mismatched in the cushioning areas
the inside of the amp seemed ill connected to the circuit board with connectors and the small bulb light not really lining up correctly but it still was somewhat solid
surprisingly the volumebalance knob worked fine and seemed accurate and firm
i am only complaining because at this price couldnt they take the time to make sure at least it looked correctconclusion after thinking about this for awhile i decided these headphones may be too fragile and not worth my cost to own again and may weigh heavily against a future decision
i might have changed my mind  had  they just replaced it with new one pulled from the rack or maybe if the lifetime warranty service had done a careful audiophile job on it
i am particular at this price range
its also apparent to me that maybe their famed lifetime warranty service is not all cracked up to what it should be and i hate to think if i ever owned one and it needed repair that it is being repaired by people who dont care for their product or have been working there too long maybe a lifetime and have only daily contempt for itcurrently looking for a new audiophile headphone to replace these
though i doubt i can find an electrostatic one in this price range
it was an excellent value
too bad
i have not commented on the sound since it is an already proven electrostatic
but if it is something that is not reliable and the service behind it is the same this puts it in a useless category that is not even worth commenting about its purposeprosexcellent value when it worksincludes everything to play or connect withits portablecomes with a quality real leather carryall baglifetime warranty service in name onlylongtime manufacturing record of esp with no changes to modelit is comparable or better to the stax headphonesconslifetime warranty service youll go broke using this unreliable service
see belowshipping cost plus koss repair fee can be prohibitive and a deal breaker if not fixed correctly the first timepoor nd tier customer careless service both via their no response email service and phonemanual is just a single semigloss fold out paper no color no wonder they trashed itcomes unsealed in an illfitting boxsome quality control issuescommon problemsrust on the gold logosheadband can be hard to attach to earphonesconclusionbuy these headphones only from the factory
you pay a lot more but it will be guaranteed  brand new
i would recommend these headphones only to those that just want extreme low distortion and a very flat response up and down the bandwidth and understand how this applies to the music you will listen to and dont mind an unreliable repair department for a lifetimeim a longtime trackball user
ive switched back and forth between ms and logitech productsthe ergonomics and button functionality of the ms trackball is superbunfortunately the performance is often hindered by a buildup of gunk inside the ball cradle
its more frustrating than the old rollerball mice
its strange that they figured out how to use laser precision and failed on the mechanicsafter using a logitech trackball at home and the ms one at work for about  years i finally gave up on the ms trackball and ordered a logitech replacement
ive never had the dirty performance issues with the logitech producta month and a half ago i purchased a trackball optical through amazon
when it arrived the installation and all went quite smoothly on a mac and it operated as advertized
as another review mentioned the forwardback buttons are a wee bit narrow but i can get used to that
out of the box the product was greatthe smoothness of the balls rolling degraded quickly
at first giving it a little push would send the ball spinning for a while
now it travels at most a quarter inch before friction stops it
since the degraded smoothness is not uniform it seems to stick in inconsistant patches so im guessing its more the rollers than the ball it is hard to get it to track without sporadic jerksa week ago it ceased tracking position at all
the buttons still work the scroll wheel still works tested by using my old mouse to point and the trackball to clickscroll but the pointer doesnt move a single pixel anymorei see no way short of snapping plastic to get inside and make sure the lenses are clean and when i called microsoft tech support for a product with  days of free support i was informed that they no longer support this product and i should look at online helpfilesso when it worked it was great
five stars
mine alas degraded quickly which was less than great but still perhaps worth three stars
then it up and stopped doing one of its primary functions which counts for no stars in my book and the manufacturer drops support for a product that was purchased less than two months prior another no star
 stars distributed over  situations so  starswhen i recieved this mouse by the look of it it was exactly what i needed  its size was bigger than in the pictures about quot long which makes for a comfortable fit and it had the  buttons that id gotten so used to on my microsoft intellemouseas other people are saying the one thing which kills this product is the trackball binds to the quotrollersquot
since this is an optical mouse there arent any moving parts but the ball does glide on three stationary metal balls and two stationary plastic retainers which keep the ball inside its socketdepending on where your thumb is at any given moment there might be pressure squeezing the ball down onto the plastic retainers
since the ball and the retainers are made from plastic thats similar in density they bind to one another  sometimes requiring quite a bit of force to unbind themthis being my first foray into trackballs i figured that id return it and get the wireless logitech that everyones howling about
shame i have both this microsoft trackball optical at my office and the alternative logitech trackman wheel optical at home and while the ergonomics are pretty much the same the ball movement is much smoother on the logitech
the microsoft ball is manufactured using a translucid plastic that is not hard enough and causes it to quotstickquot to the rollers inside its casinglet me try to explain because i feel this is very important
even though the trackball is optical meaning there is a laser beam inside the casing that quotreadsquot the ball movement there are rollers in the form of tiny metal balls the size of the head of a pin over which the ball rolls
this quotstickingquot of the ball causes the movement of the cursor to be imprecise
when you try to roll the ball with your thumb just a pixel it gets a bit hard doesnt move and then it releases its stick and rolls too muchon the logitech however this does not happen
the construction is the same plastic ball that rolls on tiny balls in the casing and a laser beam that reads the movement but the ball is a little smaller and made of a much harder plastic
this harder plastic does not stick to the rollers inside the casing so the ball is always free and the movement is smoothi definitely recommend you get the logitech over the microsoft model
logitech has both a wired and wireless trackball models both work the same way
check them outi needed to use something that required a small space so i debated on whether to get this product or the trackman wheel optical mouse from logitech
finally i decided to try the microsoft mouse
i bought two one for the pc and one for my notebook
when i first tried them out both worked fine one ball turned more smoothly than the other but both were good so i thought those people who wrote the negative reviews must have gotten a lemon
after a few days i noticed that the cursor was often unresponsive when i turned the ball
not only that but the ball itself was sometimes sticky and hard to turn
i would have to use two fingers to make the ball move and then half the time the mouse wouldnt respond properly
that was enough for me so i packed them back up and am returning them
i also ordered the logitech trackman optical so when those arrive and ive tried them out for a little while ill write a review on them
meanwhile this microsoft mouse is not recommended as its performance is too inconsistent and leads to user frustration
at the present time until the logitechs arrive i have gone back to my old regular microsoft optical mouse which works beautifullyas mentioned in some reviews the trackball in this device becomes difficult to move after a while and doesnt roll as smoothly as other trackballs
unfortunately there doesnt seem to be an easy fix for this so i have to give this one a thumbs down
i really wanted to like this trackball as everything else about it especially the ergonomics is excellentmicrosoft should really take a lesson from logitech here
i tried the trackball explorer as a replacement for my well worn logitech marbleman fx discontinued  though ill never understand why
my hands are ml  totally typicalafter  hour of use my thumb was killing me
you see you must reach back to far to hit the thumb button
if you compare it to logitech youll see that they have the buttons inline with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at allthe mouse is accurate and the ball feels nice but you have to use those buttons and they are awful
if theyd move them forward about  this would work as well as the logitech marbleman fx doesits no wonder those things are going for  used on ebay logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated iti tried this trackball for a few days and while it might have been acceptable for general use i found it unusable for graphics work
i have small hands which may be why i frequently hit the left click button at the wrong angle so that it wouldnt register
dragging with this device felt very uncomfortable and it wasnt as precise as my ancient logitech fx
i would have purchased another logitech but they seem to have discontinued all models with a large enough ball for precision graphics work
despite my small hand size i finally decided on the even bulkier kensington expert mouse optical as the most comfortable replacement for my graphics workinitial setup was nice particularly compared to dlink the tech decided the dlink was broken
but i came home from vacation and its not sending out a signal anymore
the wap connects to the lan fine but none of the laptops are getting any signalfrom it
tech support was laughably inept
now ive figured out the reset button doesnt actually do anything
they want me to upgrade firmware a third time
dsl reportscom says theres a problem with the latest firmware
i wish i could buy one of these things and it would just worki have had this wap for a few weeks now and only know that the setup is very easy and well documented
as far as knowing how well this item performs i have no idea
after setting up i tried to attach to my wired lan through the wap
although the linksys wireless compactflash card wfc and linksys wirelessb notebook adapter wpc that i purchased with the wap have communications with the wap they can not get to the internet through the access point
my day job is in the computer industry and i pretty much know what im doing
i have checked and rechecked all my settings to no avail
if this doesnt solve my problem it usually means that something has been overlooked in the information provided
my next step is to try technical support
linksys offshore tech support seem more interested in getting away from me and will tell me anything to do so
because of the accents every sentance has to be repeated several times
it is a very unpleasant experience
the information i have received from them has always been incorrect
i have never had any of my email requests responded to
at this point it looks like i will be returning these  linksys items
they are no use if i cant get them working
i purchased these linksys products because of my previous good experiences with linksys
but it looks like their takeover by cisco systems has changed their approach to customer and technical support
as with so many other companies cutting corners by taking support offshore is costing their customers dearly and will in the end be felt by their pennypinchersultimately i ended up throwing this wap away after it stopped functioning
you are far better off spending the extra money for an g wap  mbps versus  mbpsunlike other waps this device can connect to another wap and act as a bridge
if you have two ethernet networks and want to connect them it is relatively painless with this device
that was my original rationalization for buying this product
turns out i never really needed the extra functionalityi was never impressed with the  mbps speed
the first time around setup was painless
however reinstalling the software under xp became problematic
the usb driversoftware from linksys caused my windows xp machine to bluescreen and crash
it caused my windows me system to hang periodicallyi would recommend you pass on this product and get an g wap
they are faster mbps and backwards compatible with your existing b network cardsi had a linksys wap die on me after  months
i had always been happy with it  so i immediately ordered a replacement
it turned out to be the new vthe linksys v wouldnt work reliably when wep was enabled neither  nor  bit
also i seemed to have much more trouble with signal strength
so i tried a second one assuming the first was defective but the with the same resultsso i gave up on the linksys wap v and tried the smcw even though its supposedly based on the same electronics and guess what
it not only worked flawlessly with wep enabled but it gave a stronger signal and is about half the size of the wapi did get the wap v to work well though not as strong as the smc if i disabled wep
looks to me like a move in the wrong direction for linksysthese adapters are just stupid
all the network card companies are selling these adapters which work exclusively with their network cards
if you look around on the internet you can get similar adapters which will work with any pcmcia card for a similar pricei do not think this is not a pci card to connect your desktop computer to a wireless hub
it is very important to read the technical information about this card
it should say only campatible with the linksys instant wireless network pc card wpc
this is the card used in a laptop configuation
i do not think this is supposed to be used like a wireless connection for your desktop computer internet server to a hub
it is more like a cross over cable for desktop computer to laptop solutionif you are looking for quick limited solution this will work just fine
i am not saying that this card will not connect to a hub i just do not think that conecting to a hub is what this product was meant to doif you are pointing this card into a wall or hide it in a desk it is not going to work well
i bought this and sent it back at my expense because i did not read the fine printgood luck with your wireless adventure
i am sure it will be changing sooni agree this is a solid cookware
but it is so hot on the handles everytime i try to remove it from the stove
i believe they can do something about the design of the handles
btw my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally
but this is super hot beyond my tolerancewell after one day of getting water on my garmin it stopped working
everything was sealed and locked up tight but it got mosture inside the screen and stopped working i bought the etrex legend three years ago to replace an older model that i passed on to my son
the price was right and it came with garmens software a car lighter power cable and a protective case
a big improvement was the ability to run the unit off of the cars dc power while driving toward the final location and then run off of battery while on foot
however i did notice that it seemed to be less capable of getting a good signal and would frequently bounce all over the place in the woods
now it has a propensity to lock up after a few minutes of usage
ive read from earlier postings that this has something to do with outdated waas protocols
clearly if this is not something that garmen has fixed in the firmware the product will be useless
i found that the only way to unlock the unit was to remove the battery cover and pull out a battery and replace it
sometimes the reboot and reacquire process takes a longer period of time than the unit will function before locking up again
i am now looking for another replacement hopefully one that will make it easier to go paperlessyes its sexy looking
yes the screen is incredible
but if you like the simplicity of your palm youd better think twice before you switch to a pocket pc devicefirst of all you must use outlook
unlike the palm where you can use the palm desktop outlook act etc there are no options with this devicedont even think about synching this device with two desktops work and home
i have logged four calls to compaq about the issue but they have not been able to fix the situation where email addresses entered at my work desktop cannot be read on my home desktop
they synch but then the field is filled with a link to nothing
its a messthe other annoying thing is the active synch software
the editorial review above lists it as a con and they are right
its gotten so bad that in two months i have reinstalled the software four times
i also have to remove the usb driver almost daily so that it reloads when i reboot
who needs this aggravationso yes my ipaq turns a lot of heads
people are always asking about it
and i love showing them my photos from my last vacation
but when they ask if i like it i cannot honestly say i would recommend this pda to anyonelike an earlier reviewer i think a product like this should work for more than three years id say at least seven
but i didnt even get three years out of minei bought one of these in late  from a big box retailer
i was doing consutling work at a large electronics manufacturer and needed to be able to transport large data files to and from the customer site files that would not fit onto a floppy disk
usb thumb drives had not come on the scene yet
cd burners were prevalent but not convenient for my purpose
the usb zip  was a good solution for me at the timei used the drive on a fairly regular basis for about a year and a half with occasional use after that
i had it in storage no use since  and recently took it out to retrieve some files and it would not work
plugged it in click click click click click whirrrr  cannot read disk  led blinks continuosly
so while its been more than three years since i bought the unit id say i got something like  years of normal usage
its dead now and i wouldnt dream of spending  to replace it
im only considering a replacement purchase to be able to retrieve a few of the files
basically this is an obsolete product with far superior and cost effective alternatives availableif i find a low cost replacement i will quickly retrieve my data and archive it onto optical media and resell the unit if i canin  this drive served a purpose  bfd before flash drives
but i wouldnt recommend this technology in update i picked up a used ide zip  for    shippingiomega zip   disk drive  zip   mb   ide  internal  here on amazon
i have two older computers on my home network running windows xp that have ide
i hooked up the ide zip drive to one of them  windows xp recognized the drive and installation was easy
i had six disks and i got all my files off of them and on to a gb external hard drive in about  minutesif you feel as i do that this technology is obsolete and have zip disks with data you need to retrieve then i recommend saving yourself the  and taking a similar route
if you dont have a computer with ide available it looks like theres a solution
a company called newer technology offers an adapter  that they advertise has been tested for operation with ide zip drives adapts ide to usb  saw it here on amazon for  newer technology universal drive adapter  connects ataidesata to usb    hds   op
this particular model will also apparently adapt sata to usb
i cant personally recommend this one since i havent owned it  and the only review of it on amazon is a one star
but there are probably others out there i havent researched it
keep in mind that with this approach you can at least use the adapter for other things when you are donei purchased a similar adapter made by a company called apricorn from newegg
but unfortunately i havent been able to get my particular model to work with the ide zip drive  i plugged it into my vista machine with the zip drive attached
vista recognized the drive  but when i inserted a disk and tried to access the data it would respond as though no disk was inserted
so if you go this route i recommend you confirm that the adapter you buy will work with the ide zip
i find this type of adapter to be very handy
i have several old  ide hard drives i keep around that i occasionally need to inspect the contents of  the usbide adapters are a great way to be able to do that without having to open up a pc chassisits noisy its slow and it often hangs up trying to access the disk over and over again sometimes for several minutes before it connects
maybe i got a bad one but it sucksi work in the computer section of a midsized printing company and i also do a lot of web work on the side so i see a lot of different and at some points odd ways to store mediai bought my external  drive a few months ago along with  disks to go with it all of which drive and disks are sitting on a shelf collecting dustthis drive does not work well personally or professionally whether you want to reuse it a million times or store important backups
the disks are not dependable enough to rely upon to keep long term backups constant use corrupts the disks and forget about sending them through the mail
no matter how careful you are in packaging them chances are youll get a few back with messages saying quoti cant open most of the files theyve gone badquotbuy a cd writer test your cds before you give them to someone else and you wont have any problems mail them step on them pour some soda on them as long as you dont play hockey with them or melt them youll be oki got the m and the very expensive portable keyboard so that i could do lots of text entry when i was away from my computer at home then upload what id written later
i was unemployed at the time and didnt want to spend the money on a laptop
i thought i was being clever and thriftyserial connectivity was already on its way out when i bought the m but i wasnt worried because my shiny new bought just before the layoff noserial imac had an ir port and the m was supposed to be able to hotsync via ir
in fact this turned out to be an iffy procedure at besti thought id improve my odds of getting a proper hotsync if i bought a serialusb converter but i was wrong and i was out some more moneysoon i was unable to hotsync at all and the m started losing its memory every time i had to change the batteries contrary to what it said in the manual
and believe me i changed them quickly but i still lost a lot of dataall of this nonsense began shortly after the warranty ran out
i called palm for advice
they didnt try to troubleshoot the hotsyncing problem offer to tell me where i could send the device for evaluation or even recommend a similar model i might like
i was very surprised to read another review here that mentioned a class action lawsuit
i never heard anything about itits too bad because when this pda worked i loved it
if the ability to hotsync retain data across battery swaps and receive courteous service from the manufacturer arent important to you a used mxxseries palm could be a pretty sweet deal maybe as an organizer for your kids
i certainly wont ever buy a new palmbrand pda again after the way they treated me but if youre looking for something cheap easy to use and not for critical data appointments you cant afford to miss etc
 this could be just what you needok what do you do when you need a pda and you dont have a lot of cash
you buy this completely forgettable palm device use it as a stopgap measure until you can afford a decent pocket pc or linux based pda
palm has pefected the calendar and address book features of their handhelds they thought them up and have the most practice after all but the lack of versatility and connectivity with other windows programs makes this palm a sorry purchasethe processor is the same the os is the same but now nonupgradeable the size is a little smaller but the screen is much smaller 
and noticeably harder to read all for the same price as an outgoing palm iiixe or handspring visor deluxe after rebate
not much of an improvement me thinkspalm pilots in general are great things but the palm m the whole m series in fact is a huge disapointment
as the amazon review says the os isnt upgradeable  a major flaw imagine buying a pc with windows  and never being able to change it
 and the screen is too small for my tastethe good thing is that palm put a decent amount of memory  megs in this model
if you get one of the  meg models you may as well get a basic  electronic address book from radio shack
 megs should be the absolute minimum amount of memory in a handheld pc
id really like to see palm begin offering models with  or  megs of ram like dare i say it pocketpcsthe best palm model out there is the vx it is even better with an omnisky modem but it is way too expensive
the next best choice is the iiixe which i hear theyve stopped producing so grab one now which has all top of the line features except it doesnt have the internal rechargeable battery and it is biggerit jammed after about  rolls so i sent it back for a warranty repair and to extract the film cartridge
when it came back it jammed again on the first roll
i sent it again and now its working  rolls and countingthat said when it works it works well and i did some research and couldnt find a better way scan all my old aps film
so be prepared for some frustration if you decide to use this adapterlong story short
the amp began clipping at all levels  days after purchase
customer service was impossible to get in touch with and was grossly unhelpful even when you found a living person
returned for replacement and it will be  days before i get another
this is added to the fact that intel keeps attempting to disclaim my valid rebateultimately this is a very sad product
technically it is wonderfully designed with first rate sound
alas poor build quality and a customer service department manned by people woefully inadequate for the task doom this product
intel is not ready to deal directly with consumers yetfor this product to work you need two hand to operate it
one to crank and one to hold down the friction plate
it would be great if there was a way to lock the friction plate downi bought  of these to help control the extension cords in my wood shop
specifically i had    cords that needed to be off the floorassembly was quick easy and straight forward
only tools needed for assembly are a phillips screwdriveroverall the design of this thing is pure genious
however the materials werent exactly the best choices
the overall plastic construction appears sturdy enough however i do expect that these are not something that would put up with every day professional shop use and abuse
however in my hobby woodworking shop these are more than enough
the tire for the wheel that pulls the cord through to the basket is where i have the issuethe difference comes very apparent if there is any dust dirt or whatnot on the jacket of the cord
one of my cords was covered with sawdust the other not
the clean cord would up exactly as it should have with no slippage
however the dusty cord slipped on the hard rubber tire without even the slightest attempt at grabbing
i had to wipe down the cord with a damp rag then follow that up with a dry micro fiber towel and then the cord would up cleanlyi believe a softer rubber compound to the tire would make all the difference in the world traction wise
the manufacturer of this item would be well served by reading these reviews and perhaps actually testing their product in the areas that customers are complaining about and fixing the problemoverall i am happy with the purchase
and i know i need to keep my extension cords clean it just annoys me that the cord winder is forcing me to keep them clean before i can wind them upupdatei have had these for several years now and i use them with  extension cords
my initial happy withe the purchase and willing to tolerate its quirks has worn off considerably
i have ended up with slips failures and i end up fighting this thing trying to get the cords reeled back in place
i have a harbor freight self retracting air hose reel that i love using a simple tug to get it to release and it retracts
i am now looking to replace the wonder winders with a pair of self retracting cord reels if i can find some with the heavy gauge extension cordsits a bit annoying when you buy something as a gift and the gift receiver has to later tell you that there was a part missing
in this case the crank was not included in the box thus making the entire thing utterly useless
the packaging was very plain and nondescript which had me wishing i hadnt bought it as a gift in the first place
it was just a basic craft colored cardboard box  not somehting you would pick up at the store to give as a gift
the first time the gift recipient looked at it he thought it was one of those small basketball hoops
maybe a single color photo would have been appropriate somewhere on the box or inside the packaging
now were off tho start the return process
thankfully amazon is the best at what they do so it wont be a huge problemive owned this now for about four or five years and have never found it as good as many others apparently have
i use it with a very flexible heavy duty extension cord in my basement
this gadget has a large plastic wheel inside attached to the handle
there is also a plastic paddle with a button lever that sticks up at top that you press against the cord to create contact and friction against the wheelwhen i first got it the wheel simply didnt grab the surface of the cord to pull it into the net
annoying
over time the cord surface got dirty and it actually started to work a little better
but even after years i find it frustrating to use
i can press the button lever and turn the crank and the wheel mostly slips against the cord
i lay the cord out straight from the mouth of the winder and there is no tension on the free end of the extension cord  but it still barely winds into the netim astounded at the apparent good luck many others seem to have had with this winder
im jealous
wish mine would wind reliably
but it sure doesnt
and it never hasin terms of quality of construction i do find the plastic of high quality and the bracket has been sturdy
if only it did what it was supposed to dobut i also have a free hanging extension cord in the basement that i use as often if not more
when im done i wind it between my hand and elbow and then hang up the looped cord
to tell the truth this is faster and more efficient than the cord winder has proven to be  at least for methis product arrived completely disassembled sans any directions whatsoever
i finally traced the manufacturer on the web and was able to call them
to my amazement someone actually answered the phone and  after i explained that i had no clue as to how to assemble the device  lead me verbally through putting the thing together
they promised to send me the actual instructions that were missing from the package but a few weeks later all that i got in the mail was an ad from green leafi mounted the unit to a stud and then proceeded to attempt to load it with ft of  wire extension a special cord designed to remain flexible in the coldthe wonder winder is awful  at least for  wire
its awkward enough to press that friction lever back while you crank but when the wheel slips and doesnt grab the cord it becomes almost impossible to load the wire into the basket
perhaps it will work better in warmer weather  when the friction wheel softens and the wire becomes more pliable but im using this in a cold garage to hold a cord for my snowblower
it might also work better with lighter gauge extension cords but thats for someone else to report onthe wonder winder would get at least stars if it was wellmade but alas its made of cheap flimsy plastic and i dont expect to get more than a few months out of it before material fatigue takes its toll and the unit self destructsafter a lot of research i bought this unit rather than others from  well known electronics brands with a lot of trust and excitement
mi riovolt worked fine for a short while then started showing problems reading burnt cds it used to play fine
i upgraded the firmware to latest verion  and the probles worsened
after many hours of testing all conceivable settings and brand media wasted both cdr and cdrw i contacted tech support to get an answer that my unit was fine how can they tell 
and the problem was with the burner
many hours and  tests with burners later my rio does not work at all and am waiting for a reply from rioafter using riovolt about a week i regret buying it
before i purchased it i read a lot of good reviews about it
i wonder whether or not those reviews were sent by rios own people
first of all there is no reminder about upgrading the firmware on getting started poster
you must get that info
from one of the installation cds that comes with riovolt
the manual  pages on the cd doesnt tell you everything you need to know about navigating the features
the worst thing is you have no access to the newest manual online
you have to download it
i can live with that too
but the manual is exactly the same
unless you read some of the faqs in rios web site you will never find out that by pressing and holding eq button you can see all those extra features
 their tech support is another story
after sending them a detailed email i couldnt program the darn thing to play lets say tracks  second album on a  song cdr with mp files they responded with a solution for a completely different type of problem and a player rio  and rio 
  the player randomly plays tracks instead of starting with the first track
musicmatch jukebox plus that i used to rip my own store purchased cds and burned cdrs play perfectly on different computers
tracks  and so on
i can accept a cheap looking case after all the player that i was after
and ear buds
but poorly written manual and bad tech support are not acceptablethe sound on this product is actually really good
i was impressed
unfortunately while the microphone test button records my voice i havent actually been able to get the microphone to work in any other applicationi purchased this headset about nine months ago after reading all the largely positive reviews
this headset is used primarily for voice recognition dictation with nuance naturally speaking   first i was put off by the very long cord and the large audio processing unit on it
then i felt the folding headset to be pretty rinky dink and too fragile for traveling
but i rationalized that surely the digital enhancement would greatly improve the voice recognition leading to reduced typing errors and justifying this purchase
after several months of retraining the software to the new device i returned to using the el cheapo headset i initially received from nuance which produces far fewer typing errorsi have had  of these
the audio quality is amazing however both of them broke with  months of use
the wires from daily use seem to wear out and eventually both had loose wire syndrome where by jiggling the wire would cause audio to come in and go out
i use the headset a low to moderate amount
so if you are serious user this one is definitley out
i use it with an nec voip softphonei tried to like this headset but in the end i returned it to amazon
why
its heavier than i thought and doesnt grip your head
as a result when talking on the phone and working you cant tilt your head down
if you do it tries to fall off your headalso it is supposed to fold up and be portable
yes it folds up
however the big volume control and the folded headset are huge
not something i can simply slip into my laptop bag and hit the roadsorry plantronics
try againi got avaya roadwarrior up and running on my computer to use when i work remotely
my coworker told me to get a gn netcom headset but i figured id save some money and get this one
big mistakethere is a major problem with some laptops when the power cord is plugged in the listener on the other end has what sounds like you in a an airplane during flight
the humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that doesnt help me i need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or notanyway i chatted with plantronics support and then informed me that its a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using itso its getting returnedthere is a hum on the line when i use this headset for voip
the charge backs under amazons new return program dont make it worth returning
best advice is just dont buy this one in the first placei tried both and i lean towards the logitech   heres why  logitech  comes with comfy leatherlike covered foamy ear cups
for my taste its more comfortable for allday wear and isolates you from outside noise better than plantronics
logitech  is cheaper than plantronics
this is probably because of the huge honking dsp box on the usb line on the plantronics model
my computers have satisfactory sound capabilities so i didnt need the dsp
logiech  is less bulkyif you really need an mp boombox this seems to be the best of the bunch it plays mps well
the sound quality though is very poor compared to comparablypriced boomboxes with regular cds annoyingly bright hard and distorted highs that make it unpleasant to listen to for long
the am and fm reception is poor
theres no tone controls no antiskip protection no way to power it in a car and no audio out or headphone jacks for other speakers or dubbingin short youre trading off features and sound quality for mp playback
without mp playback this is a very attractive  boomboxi bought this to provide background music for my massage therapy practice
on synthesized music without vocals the sound is tolerable and the ability to put  hours of music is very nice indeed
but i regret buying itthis is a very cheap infrared remote that only works from the front of the camera
it also doesnt work well in bright light situations ie
outside in direct sunlight
the guy that paid  bucks for it paid about  dollars too much
i sadly paid  after shippingi suggest anyone looking to purchase this other than for occasional use look at wireless remotes that use radio
there are a few available in the  range that you will be much happier withthe remote is decent but i should have read more before ordering it
i would like to have the ability to focus especially if im doing tripod work and the subjects are not stationery
this remote control is basically only a shutter release with a slight delay and if your target moves out of focus you end up with a blurry picture
additionally its way too small
when i opened the box and saw how tiny this remote was i was disappointed
this remote is good for remote shutter release and thats about it really a novelty
i wouldnt have bought it had i known this up front
i need to pay closer attention to the reviews next timei had one for about two weeks then returned it for a refund
my gripes
bad headphone amplifier
far too much bass saturation
got better as it warmed up but never got good buggy software
for unknown and unrepeatable causes this unit would occasionally once every couple of hours just freak out and play garbageregular cds mp cdsdidnt matter
skipping
if you sat still or just occasionally bumped it it kept running fine
however if i tried to walk with it it would empty the buffer fast and start skipping all over the place kodak max mm single use cameras with flashnote please read my full review and followups regarding this purchase
while the product in question may have been defective the seller mel pierce camera made good on their  money back guarantee
my  star rating is the rating i gave the cameras and not mel pierce camerai ordered  packages of these kodak cameras  a total of  cameras  for our grandkids and us to take to disney world next month
i placed the order last friday and they arrived today somewhat ahead of their scheduled delivery datehowever when i unpacked the cameras and examined them i noticed on the bottom that they have a develop before  meaning they are already past their develop by date
i contacted amazon to see what was going on and they put me in contact with the seller mel pierce camera out of california
i talked to an associate by the name of cameronsp
who ensured me that the film was still good and that they guarantee their film for a year beyond the date of sale or they would give me a refund
thats fine but what do you do about all those memories you hoped to capture on your vacationcameron also insisted that it clearly said on the web site what the develop by date was for the cameras but i checked and rechecked the amazon description and could find nothing which gave the develop by date or anything which suggested the cameras and film were past their date
what the description did say was that this product was new
clearly this film is not new if its already past the develop by date when it soldi know a lot of film can still be good beyond its date but not sure i want to take that chance
i suspect this is the reason the filmcameras were about half the price one would find at wallyworld or other places like walgreens and cvs which sell the exact same product
debating whether or not to returnwill post a followup review and update my rating once i have more information to shareupdate update sunday sept    today i decided to see how well these cameras worked rather than wait and use them on our vacation next month in disney world with our grand kids so i took one of the  out of the pack and took  pictures in and around my home
i took most pictures outdoors  it was partly cloudysunny which should have been ideal weather conditions for taking photos outside but also took several photos indoors to see how well the camera would function using its builtin flash
then i had them developed at a local chain drug store where we have taken many of our photos for developing over the past several years with good resultsthe pictures were horrible all  came out a very dark gray almost as if they were taken during a rain storm or light fog but it was relatively bright out furthermore they lacked color  totally washed out were on the blurry side with almost no sharpness of detail
just really bad pictures
and the pictures indoors were no different from the pictures taken outside
the flash worked but the pictures came out the same dark gray no color and no sharpness
i shudder to think what we would have been stuck with had we waited and taken them to disney next monthi contacted amazon this afternoon right after i got the film developed and told them what i had done and indicated i wanted to return the remaining cameras for a full refund
they contacted the seller mel pierce camera and indicated the seller should contact me within the next  hours to arrange a return
we will see how it goes
i am confident amazon will make good on what it sells  they always have and is one of the main reasons why i shop there
but now i am back in the market for some single use cameras that hopefully will not be past their develop by date as these werefinal updatesept    as amazon promised the seller mel pierce camera contacted me within  hours
in fact i received an email from an employee of mel pierce camera who goes by the name of jim r who not only offered me a full refund but because of my bad experience with the kodak single use camera in question offered me a  discount on any future purchase from them in addition to a full refund and said i could keep the remaining  camerasi am also happy to report that within hours of receiving their email the purchase amount i paid had already been fully credited to my credit card account
i consider this outstanding service on the part of mel pierce camera and would not hesitate to do business with them again
its just really nice to know there are still companys out there who treat their customers rightthank you both mel pierce camera and amazonwell i too am a victim of the h or h im not sure i understand what the codes are
well the good news is i came to amazoncom to print my invoice and check the warranty on this pos
when i started reading the ratings i decided to take the cover off
procedure  took off the cover and gently spun the mechanism
plugged in nothing
spun the mechanism while plugged in nothing
then i just gently tapped on the white circle about three times and boom its all working againi had to go to  stars though because i have gotten about k hours out of this player
with four kids who refuse to turn the thing off when they leave  minutes into the movie it has done some serious work for my family
but this is still unacceptableespecially when you consider i have a apex that has about k hours on it and has not bobbledgood luckdr
kevlargreat performance but only for a short time
dont get me wrong i loved this dvd player when it worked
it had great features crisp picture and good control over the search and pause features
yeah there were some downsides to it that have already been mentioned through other reviews
for example when listening to music or other media it only shows things like directory root file and folder numbers
makes it hard to browsebut i found this to be of little inconvenience
the main problem was that it broke within a year
now im not unrealistic
i know that electronics wear out but i also know that most last much longer that this
im not expecting it to last as long as my vcr a jcpennys brand we got during the sbut one year
what a ripoff
just as others posters mentioned i got the infamous h error message and then nothing
didnt even bother calling the company since the warranty was only  days
i already knew what i was going to be told
my advicekeep looking
with this many similar reviews there must be a design flaw with this model somewhere and its not gonna get fixed by a company whose only concern is the bottom line
do some research cause when it comes to pricey electronics you wanna hold out for a thoroughbredi bought this wireless router after doing quite a bit of research and getting good reviews from coworkers even network guys on it
i have owned it for almost  years nowi will break this down step by stepinstallationcouldnt be easier
had the whole thing setup with my cable modem and my desktop in less than  mins and was surfing the net
in an additional  mins or so had my wireless laptop going and didnt have a single problem
switching from an orinoco or a cisco wireless card on the laptop was easy and no problems there eitherinitial usageit had problems
it would keep stopping and requiring a reset or a full power downpower up
i updated the firmware keep on top of firmware updates and this problem went away
updating the firmware is very very easyperformancei will review only the wireless part this
for internet browsing and basic stuff it performs great
no complaints here
it was a little slow on some of the more heavier network utilizing applications but its wireless you cant expect the speed of a lan linerangei didnt have problems with ranges in my townhouse
it worked everywhere without any degradation
when i moved to a two story colonial i started to see some range problems
it would work fine on the floor where the router was
on the ground floor however it would move from excellentgood to fair frequently
sometimes just turning the laptop a certain way would do miracles
i never had a complete dropoff though
never did try the basement featuresi couldnt have asked for a more easy to configure and more featured router for my usage
supported all the  protocols ipsecppoe for me to vpn to work
had nice control over ports and traffic
the control of dhcp and static ip addresses was nice too
didnt use much of the other featuresnow with all that said here comes the bad partabout a month ago the wireless part stopped working
i was surprised at first
i checked the router
lan activity lights were on but not the wlan activity lights
i hit the reset button no go
checked my desktop the lan connection was fine
did a full power down and power up
still nothing
checked the website for firmware updates in case i missed one that fixes something nope i had the latest firmware
this was on a friday so i just let it be
saturday still no luck
after going nutz on sat i finally emailed customer support on sunday
they responded fairly quickly within hours and after a couple and back and forth emails the response  this can happen if you are under warranty we can replace it  well the warranty is a bleak  year and i had had this router for  yearssoo bottom line i am getting a new router and probably not going with linksys again
a response of this can happen is not acceptable to methis device works perfectly if all you intend it to do is browse the internet
it will not work properly with certain video conferencing and audio communication programs
such as paltalk go to linksyscom and notice that with the linksys wireless wap and the befsr router under product features they say compatible with all standard internet applications
see if linksys says this for their befws
they dont
the befws would not work with my print server which uses a ipxspx protocol
the distance is typical and i checked it to the linksys wap and it was the same
people that buy these wireless units and believe they can walk over to their neighbors yard with their laptops will be disappointed in the range
adjusting the antennas and router position does help greatly
i switched back to my old linksys router befsr and plugged in the linksys wireless wap
everything works video conferencing audio communication print server
the extra plus is i can move the linksys wap to obtain the best wireless distance
try that with the befws you will have to relocate all the wiresok its been some months now and im still flying with the linksys befsr and the wap
remember the befws will not work with certain programs such as certain print servers video conferencing special networking programs etcthe product works well unless your setup includes having the router get a dhcp address from your provider
it would seem that every time the dhcp address expires the process of obtaining a new address fails
this results in you having to reset the router and since its wireless theres a pretty good chance youre not in the same room as the router
their tech support will only give you the next revision of the firmware if its available which they sware will fix it but never does
i gave up on them
but its not an expensive router so i guess you get what you pay foras i began to write this it had been almost six hours of attempts to set up our wireless network with no luck
the wired portion of the router did work out of the box no problem whatsoever
it was the wireless part that was a pain to deal with
after following all the steps in the user guide that comes with the router i got on the phone with a guy from tech support who ran me through most of the same steps in the user guide thats fine thats part of his job yet after  minutes or so with him on the phone we still couldnt get my laptop and my desktop to be on the wireless network for more than a few seconds at a time and they were both using linksys products for compatibilitys sake
in the end i was able to figure out myself the reason for the problem or so i thought for a few days
this past weekend after i had to unplug the power to physically move the router it stopped working for good
i am returning iti dont even know why i give it two stars i guess wishful thinking that it will eventually work basically after a month of having bought it the best thing i can get is an exchange although id love to get a refund for my money
 and i will be able lay in bed while i surf the web without a  ft wire running through my living room so far ive found the router to be annoyingly complex to set up
i would not recommended for starters or even for expert people i have been using computers for almost  years myself and i was not able to get this setup going in a reasonable amount of timeive had this router now for little less than a year
ive had some major issues with iti use this router to share the one ip that i get through my university to  computers i know a lot for one guy
according to tech support this router isnt designed for t speeds
it was only meant for cabledsl and there will lockup every once in a while
this doesnt make any sense to me but im sure they are right
every couple of months the unit will stop working without rebooting
ive already sent it back twice spending about  on return shippingim not sure if this behavior would change in an nonuniversity environment
ive asked them if i could upgrade to another unit
they said noother than that this unit is poorly designed
you only have  spaces in which you can forward ports
i wanted at least it seems if you go with linksys wirelessg routers you can install thirdparty firmware which will extend this
id recommend getting it or going with anouter manufactureri initially chose this router because of its low price
sometimes you get what you pay for and that is exactly what happened to me
as a wired router this works well enough
it connects four computers to the internet
just dont do anything to intense with it and you should be fine
i noticed that when i view video media the connection totally freezes
but for basic internet and downloading it worksi generally find however that no one buys a wireless router not to use wireless and that is where the problem is
the receiver is so painfully finicky it does not keep connections
the configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery
the linksys support team tries to be helpful but i cant seem to make this router reliable
it drops reception all the time
many times my laptop wont even detect a signal
the wireless performance of this router is abysmali sincerely hope that if you have this router it is working flawlessly for you
i cant get it to work well for me not matter what i do
the difficulty that i am having with this equipment is so bad that i am going to replace it as soon as i canive had this router for  months now and have spent countless hoursdaysweeksmonths trying to fix an intermittent internet connection loss both on the pc to which it is hardwired and a wireless connected pc
power recycling corrects the problem temporarily but in another  days one of the pcs loses connection again
i have tried reconfiguring varous ways eg static addresses dynamic addresses etc
to no availso how is it when it operates correctly
fine on the hardwired pc however the speed on the wireless connected pc is less than half the speed of the hardwired one
unfortunately that machine is window  and needs a bwireless unitbottomline its better than nothing and does the job for my little pc network
but i would not buy this for any serious networkthis product functioned well for about  years when it cost about  to  times what it costs now
unfortunately the all the connections had been so unreliable that we bought a new ethernet only router despite performing several power cycles and days of troubleshootingwe bought a basic linksys ethernet router and hooked the wireless up to it with the hope that they would connect with each other easily and at least the wired computers would be able to connect reliably
it worked but only after days of troubleshooting
ultimately we had to set static ip addresses for each of the computers play around with the tcpip protocols on the computers set the uploaded routers ip address to a different number than what was instructed on the linksys website and dealt with other nitpicky problems such as setting one router to dchp and the other to static and setting all the correct variables
apparently linksys thinks its consumers are willing to understand the difference between an ip address subnet gateway dns dhcp routing and static routing
this problem was so difficult it required the work of two graduates from the rochester institute of technology one of whom is solely responsible for a retail website whose biggest customer is microsoft and a software engineer
individuals with only basic computer backgrounds will have a much more difficult timemy only other complaint is with the interface
the linksys support staff insist that its easy to use but i can promise you that it is not
it provides explanations that are virtually meaningless even to advanced usersif youre looking for a reliable easy to use product this aint it
but if youre shopping for the cheapest product or if you have extensive networking experience then this may be a steal for youit is ok if you have a direct cabledsl connection and you dont have to wory about vpns or web proxy servers settings in your browserthe technical support folks seems to know everything and walk you through any issues as if they are reading scripts but you as a customer do not have access to such documentation
first i had trouble with getting connected to the internet after the tech support guy walked me through  steps it worked but he refused to repeat the steps for me to write down for future use
bizzarre
second i need to use a proxy server in my browser
linksys wont work at all
tech support says proxies are not supportedthird my vpn never worked and tech support folks were actually asking me to go to my vpn provider to give me sensitive port and other info to get linksys to workif you dont use proxies or dont use vpns then it is an ok product
otherwise there is no documentation for the customer to use although the support folks seem to have detailed troubleshooting instructionsclearly there is something flaky with the hardware in this thing if so many of us have to reset it all the time
i upgraded the firmware to the latest and it made no difference
if you buy one it seems to be a crapshoot whether it will work or noti am a cable modem user in a four bedroom housethe wiredwireless functions have been working fine except for the following itemsclientserver multiplayer gaming does not function
games life halflife counterstrike etc that use udp packets will freeze the device requiring a poweroff or reset
im sure a patch will come out eventually but this is a showstopper for me
i can work around it by using the linksys just as a hub and putting another router in front but i wanted to get rid of the other devicesrange was a little disappointing
long file transfers from the living room are iffy
makes playing mpeg files onto the digital tv problematici have since gotten rid of the linksys and bought a smc awbr
the gaming works and i get slightly better rangehave not tried the vpn passthrough options for either devicefinal recommendation
if you are set on a linksys wait until they patch it completely
if you cant wait get an smc
note there is an older smc model
the newer one has the ports on the back and looks more stylish rounded but the lights are less usefulharder to see
if you could use the convenience of a print server get the smc
if you have an external modem you can plug that into the smc for your connectivity
and the smc is usually cheaperi wanted to like this product for the price of a similar linksys wireless router it also supported appletalk and had a print server for windows machinesunfortunately this device simply locked up and needed to be reset several times a day
i insured that it had the most recent version of the firmware and even tried it in a second location
however in all cases it needed to be reset at least once a day if not moreim sure there are people who are having no trouble with this unit
but gauging the number of people who are reporting these lockups i have to say that this unit is hit or miss
i cant afford to keep missingi was initially so thrilled with this device that i bought my brother one too
the print server in addition to the wired and wireless router functions is of tremendous use to usunfortunately instant messaging voice conversations dont work over this device even when using the dmz and trying to open holes in the firewall as described by smc tech support
smc has also been very latent in getting new firmware out for itit has also proved unstable and sometimes slow when using the mac address filtering features
security is also somewhat flaky
in short for a basic unsecured wirelesswired router and print server it is tolerably reliable
if you want voice chats or rock solid reliability however id look elsewhere
linksys tends to be more standards compliantive had the same problems that others have already mentioned
good product and router except problems transferring large files over wireless
the router hangs and needs to be quotrebootedquot or powered off and back on to reset and work again had problems recognizing ip using dynamic ip had to use static setting after upgrading firmware amp reseting to factory this finally workedpros has builtin dns which ive seen others dont quite do within the local network easy weinterface to configuration builtin print server great range and reception from my entire homeoverall i really wanted this product to work but eventually returned it bc of the file transfer problem
i got a dlink instead and have had no major probs with thatlike somebody else said here i used this for about a year or so thinking it was great but not realizing that it really wasnt
looking back many times it needed rebooting and true enough i never got the wireless wep security setting working
so anyone couldve hijacked my internet connection and network
finally it died and i dumped it  got a siemens speedstream model  instead and it works beautifully  much betteri have reviewed several products on amazon eager to post due to favorable experiences
but this product would be the first that i feel an almost pressing need to warn consumers not to purchase
first out of the box it does contain a wealth of features at a reasonable price
but right from the start the firmware and support has been unacceptablewhen i first installed the router with pcmacs using dhcp from the router and the router using dhcp to the dsl modemrouter nothing worked
when i then assigned a static ip of the dsl modem magic we were surfing the net
but then i went to assign static ips to local computers again no net
this was with firmware  i could never set static ips on local machines but dynamically assigned ips worked fine
another feature was the router would lock up and require a reset after at least once a day which i later discovered on various message boards seems to be one problem plaguing these routerswhen i called smc tech support i was greeted by a recording saying my wait would be over  minutes and thus my call could not be completed
in other words go away were busy
this happened at various times and days
i suspect if i am willing to stay up to  in the morning i may get through
but i then sent an email to tech support that in  weeks has never been returned i did receive an automated response that they received itafter a week and on the verge of returning the product i noticed an update to the firmware  viola this fixed the staticdynamic ip addressing on the router and local machines
i was now able to use a dynamic ip from the dsl modem and set static ips on the local machines
problem is the box still locks up at least once a day so if the problem is firmware related it still has not been fixed
another few calls to tech support wait  no call thru and another email still no response after  week i still have a router that locksupso bottom line if you are one of these apparently lucky few that have had no problems and no need to call smc tech support consider this a worthy purchase
but if you are concerned about quality of firmware andor hardware and think that someday you may actually need tech support lol then steer clear of this router
the true sad ending to this though is this is becoming fairly typical than it should be with tech support service anymore
i will take this back on monday and fear again that i will begin this same process with another network products companya friend of mine bought the same router over a year ago and has had no problems with it at all
i decied to give it a try after having problems with sharing a printer through windows
i never did get it to work at all with the printer
everything else was working fine for the most part but after about  weeks it began freezing on a daily basis
over the past  months ive been using it it has only gotten worse
it seems that overheating is the problem and after a little cooling off peroid it works fine again  but this is a proceedure that goes on several times a day now
oddly enough the cold weather and prying the cover off for better ventilation has only made it worse
all of this is only with a wired setup wireless serial and printer ports are not being usedi attemped to contact smc through their website but no luck i never recieved a response
smc seems to have poor service and is not addressing this reoccuring problem
if i did it again id pay twice as much and stick with the reliable netgear or at least linksys
i wont be buying an smc againbought this because it had dialup capabilities and i have had nonwireless versions in the past and was relatively satisfied with the previously purchased models
here is what i have encountered with this new wireless one thougha random lockup at least once a day where you can still establish radio communication but ip is just not there
a reset fixes thisa lockup of networking off the box you can disconnect redial and still not move packets tofro net
a reset fixes thisthe interface is lacking bigtime
sure you wouldnt expect to need to be in it beyond initial setup but believe me youll be there often checking status during the normally scheduled lockupsanyway if you dont need dialup get something else
this box is a pain in the rear
i am just hoping theyll update the firmware as i am a slave the the fact that i couldnt find another wireless router with the dial capabilitiesive bought two logitech wireless mice as well as their wired mice
in all cases their software drivers on both mac and windows have not been able to slow down the cursor movement to a practical speed
it would overshoot due to moving too fast even on the slowest speeds
finally they came out with some software to nearly completely fix the speed control problem for the older nonwheel mice
this company is apparently making the most money it ever has if you see their financials
too bad that economic success comes with a bit of blindness to product feature quality
i sure hope they fix this problem since i otherwise like their mice but have lost a lot of money chasing their features when their drivers cant stop erratic behaviors of the cursori ordered this based on the great reviews and product description that led me to believe it would be fairly heavy material with decent padding but the product that arrived was thin flexible and made of lightweight nylon  hardly something i would call durable
i thought i received the wrong case  it was a slightly different design  but the tag indicated that it was in fact the cdw
it would seem that case logic has changed the product and the result is a lower quality item than what you see heremore specifically i expected this item to be heat resistant per the product description however the tag on the case cautioned against leaving it in a high temp car  exactly where it would be
all in all i expected a fairly cheap wallet i could throw in the car but what i got was a very cheap wallet i couldnt throw in my caramazon as always was great and refunded my money no hassle
further no other case logic product i have ordered has disappointed so ill call this an exceptioni thought this size would solve a multitude of problems with all those cds
its nice looking but too big  bulky and hard to zipi am sorry to say i think i ordered the wrong wallet from my dvdsthis one is cheaply made not like the little ones im used to buying but it said leather and he came out canvasi just dont have a heart send it backthe cover front and back of the cd holder bent in
even though it does not affect the cds it is annoying to carry it with the covers bent ini was expecting a little more from a company like case logic
it just feels cheap and i could probably make something better with cardboard and duct tapeive owned many case logic cd cases over the years
the quality of the construction has declined markedly during that time
this one feels cheap and not durable at allim going to buy a targus citygear case instead its construction quality is superior to this onenot the solid built sides for stand up use nor do they have label insert in the handle for identificationto stiffen i cut out cardboard strips out of some shipping boxes a couple of inches wide and bent into a capital j tri fold shape
then placed it between the page edge and zipper
it still allows access to the discs and i can stand them up on end with handles up for easy grabwould have better score if solid sidescl used to make sturdy with the zipper flaps made of koskinno more
the sides are made of flimsy cheap thin nylon and the zipper does not close the case compleatley on the topi would estimate about an open  inch of space remains left open on the top when tring to zip the case completelyyou might as well but a wallet that is all nylon at least some other brands like fellows have thick nylon sidesthis is cheapo stuffthe price is low so is the quality  i dont like the fact that airmoisturedirtdust can get in the case more easily due to it not sealing up compleatly at the top of the case when zipperedcase logic has im afraid lost its way depending on its prior reputation and not producing good products anymore
i wasted my money buying two of these cases
i dont trust any of amazons posted measurements after buying dozens and dozens of products so i dont even look anymore
i purchased this  cd case because i wanted smaller more convenient cases rather than buying bulky larger  cd cases
well they evidently must use the same bulky case for all of their cd cases regardless of the number of sleeve inserts
this has a  inch wide backbone for the less than  thick cd sleeves
the other  inches is just air
what a waste
the cd sleeves are standard and apparently just glued onto the inside backbone not bound in any way
the cheap thin vinyl covering and light zipper material just added to a completely disappointing product
no more case logic for mei had high hopes from the reviews
i open the box and immediately think did they send me the correct case
i go online to check and then i notice other reviews that are new advise the company changed the case and it is different than what was shown in photos
im not pleased with this purchase at allbought this item from a wholesale club and while it does everything a cd storage case should it has the worst zipper of any cd case i own
the end of the zipper is sown into the case so when you try to close the case you really have to struggle to grasp it with two hands and tug  pull till you find the right angle
believe me after a couple of times doing this you will understand
buy a case from another manufacturer
the headache isnt worth iti would have to agree with some of the other reviews
i have some older caselogic cddvd cases that are far better quality than this one
it is just so cheaply made
it seems to be just thin plastic
i doubt this case will hold up very long
at  it is grossly overpriced
 would have been about rightcaselogic is apparently in financial trouble
when companies start changing to cheap materials and workmanship it can only mean one thing
they are in bad shape financially and are trying to cut corners while still charging the same prices
in the end the customers suffer and the company inevitably goes out of business anywayone lesson that other companies can learn from caselogics mistake is that if you manufacture highquality products and charge a fair price even if that price might seem a little on the high side customers will still buy the products and the company will continue to thrive
there is no point in trying to save a few pennies here and there because it will cost you megabucks in the endin the end i guess i will keep the case since it is too much trouble to return it
this will be the last caselogic item i will ever buy
i am no longer a customer of theirs i am a victimwell i feel rip off
this is not the same as the picture case logic koskin st generation instead the one i got is the updated version which is crap 
different quality has ugly orangebrown stitches
looks like the material wont last that long
soo regret case logic is downgrading material i miss the old case logici rate  stars because inside the case kinda similar but not the sameholds a lot of dvds but the materials are flimsy
when its full you better hold it by two hands carefully or it will rip apart because the cheap materials cannot hold the weightthe quality has gone downhill in this brand
the outer material is very thin and everything is light gauge
when you open the book all the way the zipper gets pulled way in and it a pain to get out
at the end of the day it does hold the cdsdvds but there are much better options in the same price range out therethis unit comes in two detachable halves the front half which contains the player controls and internal memory and the back which contains the combined external memory and battery
the front is a beautiful work of art the back piece is a total disasterthe back is a permanent they say nimh battery and mb memory fused together at a high price to buy spares
these external tunes will cost you per hour to store i can buy mb smartmedia so what givesthe battery and charging system have some major issues which i got past because im mechanically inclined
i think most of those units being returned do not have defective batteries the battery is either not seated correctly or the charging routine misread the charge state and needed to be rerun or people unplugged them from the initial charge too early
they should have just provided a loose nimh battery and left the battery choice up to the owner
this is a public relations nightmare
the battery does come out even though they tell you not to remove it
they are the same as what works in my digital camerai predict these backs will be redesigned
or perhaps a third party could do it better and cheapersave for the above problems this is a very nice player in form and function
the sound is great and the player controls are almost perfect
a minor problem is they need a better way to rearrange the play order of the tunes inplayer
the included headphones look like they were designed for a the head of a space alien the earpieces are pointing in a funny direction
expect to replace themthe pc software  i dont want mp software that is chock full of obtrusive ads and nag screens like real junkbox i just want a simple window container that i can drag and drop tunes to and from
why cant this software extract from the player as well as write to itmy main requirement was solidstate memory
i was mislead by many of the tech sites that listed the rio as being able to accommodate compactflash external memory so i dont know if i will keep this one
if they had a back that took compactflash or smartmedia and a generic aa slot it would be the perfect playerunit worked fine for  minutes after which the the power went off and would not come back on
works fine with battery charger plugged in so i tend to think it looks like it is a problem with the rechargable battery or its system of communicating with the processor
if the unit worked the way it did for the first  minutes i would give it close to a  star rating
however based on my experience and the other user reviews i have seen i can not recommend anyone buy this unit until the manufacturer does something about what appears to be an abnormally high defect ratethis is the th rio product in my household
i bought a rio my wife has a rio and now i have the rio
we also very briefly had a riovolt  cd player
the quality on all  products has been abysmal
the rio has rechargable batteries which they claim have  hours of use between charges
 hours is more like it for the first  months now its about  hours a little over a year old
there is no option for replacing the battery
ive also noticed after a year of use now out of warranty i get these bizzare screeching or warbling noises in the middle of playing music or audio books
now the thing stopped working all together
the features of this product were right on target but rio really has a lot to learn about qualityim going to take this opportunity to fully vent on the subject
if you want the executive summary buy belkin or netgear equipment and avoid linksys
if you like the ravings of a frustrated it pro doing someone a favor read oni hate these things i really do
you absolutely must install the software for it in order to get them to work with windows xp home but heres the kicker it wont install the wlanini file to the system
oh no you have to manually copy it to the system in the program filescrappy wireless lan adapter subdirectory yourselfand then reboot
and then quickly now before it notices open up the wlan moniter yes they spell it exactly that way and click through to profiles
you may get lucky and it will allow you to edit the profile so you can finally pick the routers broadcast channel and get connectedyou might think well xp has the wireless zero configure function
and it does
and linksys defeated it for hours
theres just no tab in the windows side for channel selection
id like to give a big shout out to microsoftyo you guys missed something
like the only thing thatallows the adapter see a router
stupid
dumbsigh theyre cheap they use usb its inevitable someone you know will have one
once installed they just work
nothing special nothing especially cool they do the job of hauling packets for you wirelessly
but so what
its supposed to do that
the added value is in easeofinstallation isnt itfredfirst of all there are at least two  devices very different in appearance that are both called wusb
i have apparently the one without the foldout antenna pictured abovethe windows me drivers for this product caused bluescreen errors on my vaio pcgfx until i finally removed them
the windows xp driver doesnt appear to work at all it recognizes the unit but wont see any networks
the xp driver is also unsigned and the installation instructions tell the hapless user to simply ignore the unsigned driver warnings from xp
since theyve had plenty of time to have the driver qualified by microsoft my guess is they just havent gone to the trouble to make it reliable enough to pass logo testingfor what its worth ive relegated this thing to use on an older machine running windows  and it seems stable enough in that configurationmaybe the quototherquot wusb and its drivers are more stablescottgreat product for intermittent use like if you fire up your computer and browse the web answer emailbut if you want a constant long term connection forget it
after about  mb transferred it hangs your system
ive reproduced this bug and a normal nic card gives me no problems
so you are always rebooting every day if you are serving
i even updated the drivers toothere are a couple of other reviewers who have experienced this toobut if you do need it for shortterm stuff its greatthis adapter is the most frustrating piece of hardware ive ever come across
beware when using with winxpvery touchy
sometimes it works perfectly
other times it wont connect to the internet even though it is receiving a perfect signal from the router which is also linksys
my netgear card that i use in my laptop has always worked fine and was cheaper than this lightweight piece of plastic
i would recommend passing on this unless you dont mind spending hours browsing the linksys website trying to solve your xp compatibility issues
ackbought this product about  months ago
i got it to work for about a week
it worked on wink and xp on laptops and pcs
then one day it started having problems communicating with my wireless router
keep in mind i have a top of the line wrtg bg linksys wireless router
so you would think it would certainly be compatible with the same brand linksys wusb b
well maybe but it hasnt made up its mind yet
i am getting quotcant associate with access pointquot in the wlan quotmoniterquot software despite having no wep encryption and ssid broadcast enabled on the wrtg
the wrtg router is squawking all default settings and no wep yet and the wusb is set up to accept everything just as the wrtg broadcasts itbut  all i get now is quotcannot associate with access pointquot message in the wlan quotmoniterquot
it would appear to me that since the wrtg can communicate with any other wireless device i have that the wusb has decided its not talking with my router any more no matter what laptop or pc its installed on
it is so frustrating because the wusb will see my wireless home networkssid just fine considering its only  feet away in my apartment at any given time it should work darnit
 even after i hit refresh in the quotmoniterquot console several times
its when i hit quotconnectquot that i get the fateful quotcannot associate with access pointquot again
hmmmm  linksys also spelled quotmoniterquot incorrectly by the way not like i care so much about that though
it would appear that this device is prone to unpredictable behavior especially in the clear absence of any rf interference on the  band and given the fact that i can put the wusb device within  feet of the wrtg router  and it still wont work now
this irritates me to no end because i am a computing and networking professional so you would think this wouldnt be a problem for mewell the jokes on me and this device andor the quotmoniterquot software certainly is far from perfectlinksys what kind of product is this
will it ever work again
it cost me  please tell me it will star for the fact that it worked for a while
 star for the fact that i like the wrtg router so ill throw that in because im feeling hospitablelinksys usb wireless adaptor looks nice but thats about it
was dead right out of the box
after installing software and connecting power led lights up but computer doesnt even detect the wireless adaptor
i tried the adaptor on  other computers to make sure that it was the linksys adaptor that was at fault
by the way im an it professional and i have experience with wireless equipment so i know what im doing
ive had problems with linksys equipment in the past
when it works its great linksys has made too many defective equipment for me to recommend this to other people
not including this adaptor ive also had problems with  linksys wireless access pointrouterbefs and  linksys wireless access pointwap
netgear equipment in my experience seems to be a lot more reliable with similar pricesnote i have determined that the usb cable that came with the wireless adaptor as at fault
it seems they shipped a whole batch of wireless adaptors with defective usb cablesok its now  months after my purchase
this was a backup dvd player and gets used a couple times a month at best
it usually sits on the spare tv and doesnt have much use
the sound has gone out completely
ive tried it on two tvs and nothing
just out of warranty too
pass on this one and look elsewheremy wife has a palm m that she likes i have a palm m that works so inconsistently i am looking for something else
my wifes will not sync with the computer so i had the computer looked at and tuned up by the computer doctor
that did not help
we received a court document saying we could change out the sync modules but we had to have the receipt proving we bought the palm
of course they had our warranty certification and address but that was not good enough
overall my wife is decently happy with hers but with all the problems we have had i would never buy another palm
oh the  day warranty is not too great either
i assume that the the palm people have little trust in their product or they would offer a year warranty
im sure the  dollars they charge for service after the  day warranty is a major profit center for them
after thinking about this some more i not only wont buy from them i hope they go out of businesspurchased from amazon  in florida
my palm m arrived shortly after i ordered it however there was no stylus as advertised and the software was pirated from the original on a used cd in a dirty case  did you think i wouldnt notice the m driver handwritten across the cd in magic marker
also this palm arrived dead as a doornail and had to be recharged
so nice of you to send the cradle you promised
now im off to buy a stylus and a manual since the software contains nothing in the way of startup and care instructions for this thingi must say that im very dissapointed with the m
ive onwed palm iii and palm vx before and never thought that i will be switching however when it came time to upgrade just last weeki had a chance to compare the sony clie c  and the m sidebyside
this should be recommended to everybody before they purchase the m because the sony screen is so much better
it is actually bright you can see colors clearly it is great outdoors and has x resolution as oposed to ms standard x
the detail sharpness and brightness of the sony are simply in a different categoryto sum it up shame on you palm for selling the most  palm os based pda that has such a poor screeni did not research this one because i was happy with my previous palms
the screen in the ads has the night light lite so it appears to have backlighting which is does not
you have to have direct light to see the screenyou can use the light to make up for the darkness but it runs the battery down quickto add to my sting
the m came out  weeks after i bought iti will probably get a clie or a handspring the next timeif you are debating between a pocket pc and a palm the pocket pc wins hands down
we have both in our household and the advantages of the pocket pc are many
for example go to your local retailer and try out the handwriting recognition
the pocket pcs is almost flawless and does not require anything other than gradeschool letters
the special characters for ordinary letters required by the palm often dont work and the screen always seems to need to be realigned
you dont need to use an extra stroke for numbers or capitals on the pocket pc
and word compleation is a real timesaver over the palm
the calander is much easier to read and the display looks much more professional
there is a great deal more functionality with the ability to read and create word and excel documents
games are better as welland if you have a palm and run out of battery look out
if you didnt sync recently you may lose everything which just happened with our household palmokbeen a palm customer for a few years here
as of late been holding onto my loyalty to palm for a few reasons i hate microsoft palm fits in my pocket availability of accessoriesand nowcolor and expansion memory sigh
if you are one currently debating ce vs a palm device read oni recently made the switch to the new dimension in palm computingcolorthe m and i am totally disappointed
i feel misled by palm for trying to debunk the negitives without addressing the issues for customers
i work in the tech industry in silicon valley and know a few people inside at palmthere is alot of damage control going there
they have lost me as a customer and many others i know
the facts are belowfirst accessories are not readily available for the palm
many are backorderedthe basics
forget rd party hardware it isnt even shipping yet
so all those that went with the vx and are considering sticking with the palm for the same benefits very few of them still existsanother dissapearing benefit of being a palm customer that is disapearing is functionality
i mean unless this is the first bit of research that you have done you full well know that all the pdas got palm beat
in fact i wonder what ol karl ceo is doing because his products are down right archaic all the sudden
all the things that ipaq journada can do and all palm does is the basicsno sound for mp or synching documents other than in the format that palm wants them in
lets talk about the color
it stinks
really it is the truth
where did they come up with the claim that it has  colors
i had to call palm as soon as i got mine because i could only see  colors
also it is very dim even with the backlight on
not in brightness but in richness in color
very big disapoinmentas for the microsoft thingyes i still hate ms although when you think about it running a ms device if you are using ms on your desktop may integrate better
i have heard that the ce platform has come a long way in ironing out there bugsmuch like theyt do with all teir other software v v v etchaha but now is is tolerable and with all the back up cards now who cares you just restore data if there is a crash
get a good warrenty and  hrs later you are up and runnnig again
i recently had my palm crash  times which made me rethink my positioning
palm sent me  new units could not explain how each one was crashing but acknoledged that it was not my faultalso had the gaul to charge me for cross shipping each timethe only real advantage is the size
if you have alot of money to blow size matters and all you need is a contact sort of datebook then this one is for you
however if you consider this an investment and are looking to really use it for things to be efficient and oftengo straight to the ipaq
you wont be disappointedany one wants to buy a  with all the goodies cheapgot one availablethis dvd player has trouble playing hdcds
i returned the unit back to the store where i purchased it and got a replacement unit but still the second unit suffers the same problem
i was told by toshiba to bring the unit to one of the authorized warranty service center to have the bios upgraded
i havent done so but those who are thinking about purchasing this particular model  consider yourself be warnedit took some computer savy to get setup but once it was the frame and idea are really nice
that is until the ceiva frame broke
no warning just stopped showing pictures
not much luck with customer service via email so far
it is hard to rate a product very high when it is broken in  months
it also breaks your heart when you get your grandmother used to seeing grandkid pictures on a regular basis then it is gone with no reasoni bought this for my family in puerto rico
when they came to the mainland  for a visit we set it up in the guest room for them
it certainly  impressed them as it seemed to be userfriendly and just kept flashing  pictures of those grandkids
from the transmitter end ie
the sending  pc i found it a little cumbersome and slow to upload  pictures even  on a fast isdn connection
looking at the ceiva screen myself i would say  it looks like a small early laptopgrade image and suffers badly at even   degree angles
it also washes out in any bright room light or indirect  sunlight
all of that notwithstanding it still seemed like a pretty good  means of getting pictures of the grandkids to my inlaws without their  having to do any downloading via the internet
then the bad news  when  they got it home to puerto rico it wouldnt work
ceiva customer service  informed me that even if we didnt mind it making a daily long distance  call the box was not set up to dial long distance i see where a canadian  customer has had the same experience
so there it sits in puerto rico  usa displaying the original  photos from  months ago while my monthly  subscription to the ceiva service ticks awayi bought mine exactly  year ago and i have the same dns complaints as everyone else
and it seemed to have cropped up after upgrading firmware to  from  or  half a year ago
if i am downloading or sharing something large at my max adsl downspeedupload kbps dns failures are very common
and i frequently download from newsgroups so this is a real issue
i imagine users realtime videa and audio will have the same problemit is easy to setup and use and seems to work fine as a lan router and print server though i havent used it much as one
it works fine if i am not maxing my net connectionfrom the other reports of terrible customer service i advise anyone to avoid this company if you have a similiarly priced alternativeit is still much than using pppoet dialer software that the telco gives you to access dsl without a adsl routerseveral reviewers have posted and said that after a certain period of time the router starts dropping their internet connection randomly
i too have had the same thing happen but have traced it to a dns problem not a connection issue
what this means is that the router for whatever reason loses its ability to translate numeric innternet ip addresses such as  to names  so if your internet connection appears to have died bring up a command prompt and try pinging  or any other ip address
if that works then you have a dns problemto resolve this issue contact your isp and find out what their dns server ip addresses are and then plug that information into the routers configuration or into the tcpip network settings for each machine connected to the interneti dont know why this problem occurs but once i manually entered the dns settings everything worked fine
i have had no other issues with this router other than the network connections being in the front of the device instead of the back as others have commented on alreadyif you are reading this review trying to decide whether to get this router i wold advise against buying anything from netgear or linksys
if you read the reviews for pretty much any netgear or linksys router on this site you will see that most of them get horrible reviews for reliability issues
plus many have stated that netgear customer support is horrible and i can attest to that
i sent them an email once and it took weeks before they responded backyou may want to consider something like the zyxel prestige  instead
it may cost a little more but word on the street is that its a better product and more secure also
i plan on buying one to replace my netgear prwe have had the product for  months now
we have taken almost  pictures with the product and deleted  of those pictures
this camera just never gets the picture you want
when you press the button it can take anywhere from  to  seconds for it to take a picture
the absolutely bare minimum time is  and is almost never met
the camera is designed to eat batteries for breakfast lunch and dinner
we had to buy a rechargeable alkaline system in order to avoid going to the poorhousethe smart engineers who designed this camera noticed that it eats batteries too quickly
their solution was to turn off the camera if you let your finger slip from the shoot button for only a moment
if you are fortunate to be saving batteries in this way it takes only ten seconds for the camera to warm up and be ready to take an actionpacked shot
this ten second delay is incurred when you press the take picture button
the screen often goes blank right before you press this buttonwe have used this camera to miss literally thousands of wonderful shots of our twin boys
if you like to miss photographs if you like to get pictures of people looking the other way or with their eyes shut or with their body turned entirely away from the camera there is no better camera on the market for this purposewere buying another camera
this one is just too uselessi own an olympus c and love it
i purchased the d to use in places where i would not want to take a more expensive camera ie
at the beach camping etc
first the good points
the camera has almost every function you would expect  including the ability to view the pictures on a tv via the rca output
it does not have the ability to take video or capture audio
but frankly i never take video or capture audionow the bad news
the picture quality of this camera is awful
pictures are grainy and lack details and vibrance
i set my c to the same resolution x and took a picture of the same subject with both cameras
the picture was taken outdoors to eliminate the effect of the flash
the picture on the c is vibrant and full of color
the whites are white reds are red and blacks are black
i then took the same picture using the d
what a difference
the entire picture is grainy and muted
the whites look like they have little dots of every possible color  and not true white
the blacks and reds are muted and dull
i was expecting the same picture quality if both cameras were set to the same resolutionthis camera is being returned
not recommendedi bought this camera  years back and its a plain simple point and shoot camera with a fixed lens and you cant adjust anything
it has no optical zoom no video recording etc
but thats what you pay for
picture wise the camera shoots beautifully and the colours come out really nice and natural
its flash is pretty bad with flash shots coming out dark
i have taken decent x prints even with the lower resolution
the power onoff switch is really horrible and flimsy
it broke after few months of use and i had to get it repaired
after that my computer never recognises the camera and i have to use a card reader to transfer photosi wouldnt recommend this camera even to a first timer even though its very very simple to use
its just too flimsy and featurelessi usually like kodaks digitals but this one has a strange mix of features that should render it unacceptable to both amateurs and to advanced users
to wit the image quality is very good boasting  megapixels of resolution enough to handle not only webbased photography but enlargements of up to quot x quot as well
however this is completely offset by a fixedfocus lens and no optical zoom it has a digital zoom but these are not nearly as useful
the rest of the features are acceptable including memory amp expandability flash battery useage amp usb connectivity
kodak is selling an optional docking station for this camera that allows for easier downloading of images to your pc but any memory card reader viking or sandisk is simpler cheaper and more versatileits fair their is much better ones out their now at the time it was fair not great not recommendedi have the same problem in  of the cars ive tried it in
the springy center part does not spring out correctly leaving only intermittent contact
i got garmin to sent me a second one free but it has the same problem
this makes  total since i had one of the older style ones with the com port for my older unit
i had to fix that one using the spring from a ball point penits not just in my car either
ive used other car adapters without any problemmine were broken right speaker seems attenuated to perhaps  of its pair as reported by others
not good for stereo
i found an alternate use as external speakers for my in tv at work
mono of course but a vast improvement over the tiny one inside so i kept em
as an alternate you may consider the hk its big brother a system can be found used here or ebay aprox fifty bucks wship if you search or dayton b w leipei same price if you dig around
stay thirsty my friendsi gave these to my sister inlaw because she needed speakers
i was not happy with the sound quality and  logitechs sound better and take less spacedumb buy bairly louder than my iphone alone and way to bassyi needed extra speakers immediately for a last minute project and had to buy these at radio shack because they were the closest store that was open
if i had had the time to shop around i would have purchased something much betterthe sound quality is soso and about what you expect for lowend computer speakers
they need an isolation filter and better shielding
the light in one speaker started flickering  weeks after purchase and went out completely  months later
the lights serve absolutely no purpose other than to let you know the system is powered on so it is not a big deal
the blue lights are kind of unattractive and cheaplooking anywaythe connector to the subwoofer is very poorly constructed so that it generates significant noise whenever the wire is touched
if you have the wires lying around unprotected or dangling off the back of the desk you are likely to have issues with noise and staticthe worst part is that the speakers are sensitive to cell phone signals
anytime a cell phone call comes in or goes out and the phone is within  to  feet of the speaker there is a extremely loud clicking signal passed through the speakers
also anytime the cell phone is pinged by the phone system this noise occurs  you dont need to have a call coming in to have it happen
i have no other speaker system that has this happen to it
ive had the speakers for about  months now and would have replaced them if i used them more often but i dont
i dont have the time to open up the subwoofer and the satellite speaker to fix the shorting issues so i cant say if the problems are even repairable
i assume they are but they never should have been so poorly made to begin withthe good thing is that these speakers are pretty cheap
it is hard to find anything much cheaper than these and sometimes that is all that you want  something that puts out sound and not necessarily of good quality
so if you want to take the chance to buy them and they dont work out for you you arent going to be out a lot of money
on the other hand there are much better speakers for about the same cost so you shouldnt have to throw away good money on these when you have other alternativesthey might sound bad to me because i am used to audiophile headphones
but they dont sound terrible
nice clean highs but the bass is a little muddy
maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in but for the price  i especially like the volume control and headphone input
it works excellent and matches my system
but these speakers are great for the price
if i spent  on them i would be mad with the sound quality but for less than  they are excellent
i just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too
check out my other reviews on which speakers i got
these will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair not worth sending them backthese speakers worked okay for me for a while until the volume knob failed and i was unable to use them any longerthis item has had a bad volume nob from the start but i was so busy doing other things i was not able to return it to the store and when i contact warranty support they say i have to ship in the whole unit
they cannot just send me a new nob because it is all wired together it does not work good
it goes from low to high in a short space or has static when i move the nobwhen i first reviewed these about months ago i thought they were an amazing little set of speakers
they had decent sound were compact and under bucksbut i was lucky enough to the logitech ss which go for bucks
the logitechs blow the cybers away in both power and sound quality
the cybers distort at full volume even with my eq settings adjusted and the gain and bass turned down
the cybers have a high shrill on some kinds of music mostly metal that is almost impossible to get rid of even when eq is played adjusted
look point blank dont buy these
they are half the power of the logitechs and bucks more expensive
it makes no senseif they were bucks i give them  to  stars for sound at a great value but considering these dont hold up to the logitechs it makes no sense to purchase them
they are decent speakers but have to many setbacks that would make me tell you to spend more when you could spend less and get something that it better in sound
now please dont think the logitechs are going to sound like a  set of high end monitor or bose speakers but i would say they edge out these by at least a star and a halfthese speakers probably have the best sound you can get for less than 
unfortunately they also have the worst radio interference ive ever seen
the cabeling is very poorly sheilded and is hardwired to the speakers so you cant easily switch to better wiring
theres a constant faint buzz which gets worse from time to time
somethime sound will play crystal clear othertimes theres horrible distortion
its a real shame that these speakers werent made with better cableing or atleast designed so that you could switch the cables to something better
ferrite beads  from radio shack may be one solution if that doesnt work id try rewiring the the cables by hand with something with better sheilding
still since i only paid  after a rebate for these i cant really complain if nothing else theyve increase by understanding of the problems that can occur when setting up an audio system
if you dont mind tring ferrite beads or other rfi solutions or if your computer is somewhere with no interference then try these speakers you wont find simliar onces cheaper and they sound much better than a speaker setup as long as the rfi isnt too badwhen the audio is in use the speakers deliver decent sound
when the computer is asleep or otherwise not in use the speakers randomly buzz and pop loudly
if youre a couple rooms away youll stop what you were doing and say what the heck was that
  if youre in the same room it scares the crap out of you obviouslysometimes you get what you pay for and this is no exception
dont waste your money on this set just spend a little more and get a set of logitech speakers with a subwoofer
you wont be disappointedi recently needed two sets of speakers one for my new media computer and one for my home office both are in bedroomsi got thelogitech s  speakersfirst a little pricier
they did not blow me away so i decided to try these ca speakers instead of getting another swell it was a mistake
these sound considerably worse stars since they work and would probably be fine for someone who wasnt listening to music
ill not be keeping them longthese cant hold much sound
though the bass speaker is cool and onlight is cool they just dont come through with the sound i was hopping for
i bought another pair of speakers which i recommended above to buy instead which are  more but are what i use as my stereo speakers now
id leave these alone  theyre too delicate and though they look cool the dont sound cooli bought these to have some tunes in the basement while i worked on stuff
im not at all impressed with the sound quality
i should have spent a little more and got some decent speakers
my laptop speakers sound better than theseim giving these  stars because the sound is not horrible although you certainly should not expect deep subbass or highquality soundthe real problem is the lack of shielding
as others have noted the speakers pick up radio frequency interference
mine make a loud and very alarming noise a fraction of a second before my cell phone rings or gets a text message
they also make a strange sound when airplanes fly overhead
additionally i get a low hum from them when music is not playingsince these are not sheilded they may also cause problems interference with crt monitors but i cannot verify this as i have lcdsall in all i would definitely not recommend thesethese speakers sound good for the price
however they arent worth it
invest in better quality speakers
heres why  mine broke
the left speaker no longer works unless i jiggle the cord for five minutes  granted ive had these for two years but the cords are not detachable so there is little hope of fixing this problem
i suspect i could have spent twice as much to get better speakers that would have lasted four years instead of two
interference
from the first day i got these they made horrid crackling noises while not in use
using a cell phone near them sends them into paroxysms
just terrible
i often have to turn them off to stop the noiseif these speakers didnt sound so good for the price they would be one star
as it is i wish i had spent more two years ago
save yourself the troublethe web site said it would work and the package also said its for all lk models but it is not the correct part not even closethe voltage and amperage is good but the plug is the wrong size and is too small to plug into the keyboard as if that wasnt bad enough the positive and the minus pins are wired backwards for my keyboard
the keyboard needs negative on the outside of the barrel plug from the adapter but it was positive insteadim in electronics so i replaced the plug using one from my box of my junk adapters to the correct size and rewired it so the polarity was correctlest you think im a sony basher let me tell you i have plenty of sony products im very satisfied with
this isnt one of themmy big debate was to buy a camera from a primarily electronics manufacturer or from an established camera manufacturer
after much thought and research i went with the p
it came down to the p canon a or to wait for the nikon  or olympus  i bought in may 
shoulda waitedill just summarize otherwise itll be a  page reviewproshigh quality images in good light outdoorsnice sizeonly aas required
decent life if you minimize lcd display time and get mah capacity nimh rechargeables
i get about  pictures with flash indoors with little or no lcd use
outdoors maybe  pictures
from the review below  if your flash is dead after only picture youre doing something wrong
flash exposure and ambient exposure compensation modestakes mpeg movies
no sound thoughcan use infolithium packpainless connection to the pcconspoor pictures in low light conditions  lens is slower than the competition f vs  for competition flash is pathetically weak
even in night mode the camera fails to let in enough light to take pictures of a lit building even with ev overexposure dialed inflash recharge time when using nimh batteries is slooooooowmenu system cumbersome to use if youre fiddling with exposure and flash settings often
direct access buttons are much fasterinfolithium battery and charger are big sony memory sticks more money than the competition
though they are a nicer form factor and more durable imhoin summary if you do alot of picture taking outdoors youll probably be pretty happy but if youre using the flash and indoors probably not
do yourself a favor and look at the nikon canon and olympus firsti owned this camera for less than  hours
i bought itand decided it was one of the worst purchases that ive ever made and returned it the same nighti agree with many of the problems with this camera and here is a quick summarypros its small but so are most of other brands it takes good pictures in well lighted areas the software is flawless loading pictures are extremelyfast and easycons  the lens is extremely awkward
who was the genius thatdecided to position a jumbo sized lens off to the sidehello
where am i supposed to position my fingers  the battry consumption is insane
i went through myenergizer max after only  pics
i guess i should go buythe more expensive lithium batteries or better yet somestocks in battery companies  i much prefer the sliding lens cover that comes on theolympus d
the dangling sony cover is extremely annoying  the constant need to use the flash
without it you will notbe able to take good pics in less lighted areas
oh yeahwhen you do use the flash have fun waiting for the slooooowcharge as the sony is draining your batteriesi am a huge sony fan and ive bought numerous sony products over the years
i even have a sony mastercard
but this product is a major disappointment to me
for the price and the way the electronics world works youre much better off shop around and if you insist on sony brand just wait for a later update which will inevitably be better and cheaper
good luck with your searchi bought the mdrnc headphones for a trip from sf to chicago and they were sorely disappointing i thought that i would get noise reduction and better sound quality
this is not the casesound with noisecancelling off the headphones sound terribly weak and thin
they sound no better than my  sony inear headphones
there is no bass response on these headphones with noisecancelling on the headphones managed to block out about  of the airplane noise
however there was still a significant amount of rumble noise
sound quality was still thin but prevailed over the cabin noise due to the noise cancellation feature
the headphones have an onear design so it lets in a lot more noise than models that cover and surround your ears completelycomfort these headphones press directly on ear
the earpads are padded but the headband is not padded
after an hour i started to feel a bit of soreness on my ears because they pressed a little too hard on themthe few positives compact
they fold up which is why the headband isnt padded and they fit easily into your carryon luggage price
they are somewhat cheap for noisecancelling headphones
but as my review implies you get what you pay for circuitry  all the electronics including the onoff switch are located on the headphones and not on a box between the headphones and the plugi might have been more satisfied with these headphones except that i shared my connecting flight with my brother who has the bose quietcomfort headphones   i tried those headphones out and they are absolutely amazing
they fully cover your ears have a padded headband sound much better and block out substantially more noise than the sony mdrnc
the tradeoffs are that they have the intermediate box that houses the batteries and the noisecancellation switch and that they are not very compact
having tried the bose model i realize the full potential of noisecancelling headphones and the cost associated with them
you definitely get what you pay for in these situationsi discourage anyone from buying these headphones
please spend more money for better models  i am going to try out the sony mdrnc headphones which have an overtheear design so they should provide better blocking of external noisei viewed tapes on several of these machines sony slvn over the weekend
i was not pleased with the picture at all
picture playback is what it should really be all about
all of these units i played prerecorded tapes sp mode on looked grainy or almost like i was seeing double hard to explain
the picture just did not look right
i played how the west was won spartacus and disneys the hunchback of notre dame
the animated hunchback looked best
if you watch animated movies i suppose it did not look all that bad
its difficult to recommend this sony unit
this is very disappointing and unfortunate
i am getting the impression that manufacturers are letting their vcr lines get out the door with very little qa involvement
that is a shamei just rescued my sister from the clutches of this cd player
she was having a few issues with it freezing up and the carousel rotation being a bit iffysometimes it would not go to the selected disk but overshoot to the next onelike most people who have no real experience with quality audio electronics she bought this player at best buy mainly because of the sony brand name recognition
after all she is from the generation which grew up in the s when sony was still making high quality products whereas nowadays only their tvs are decent and their home and car audio stuff is mediocre to downright awful the sony xplod car audio series in particular is awful both in performance and long term reliability especially their car ampsthe sound quality on this cd player isnt awful but it certainly isnt greatfor a hundred and seventy dollars you can get an oppo  which plays a gazillion different formats both audio and video is multiregion capable and whose audio quality would wipe the floor with this player as well as surpass most audiophile cd players costing up to seven or eight hundred dollars eg
a rotel rega or cambridge audio now if you really must have a multidisk player i would recommend a marantz cd or if you want to stay within the one hundred to two hundred dollar ballpark go to accessoriesless dot com and look at their refurbished marantz carousels cc and cd or even their onkyo and denon refurbs
my sister ending up getting the onkyo carousel from them for about the same price as this sony and is much happiermore reliable better build quality and sound qualityin short the only decent quality audio gear that sony still makes is their es series of receivers and cd players but at that price range youd still get much better sound performance for the money from smaller audiophile makes like cambridge audio nad marantz just to name a few
whatever massmarket audio gear including dvd players that sony makes nowadays is just a marketingdriven effort to cash in on their brand name recognition while using the cheapest possible subcontractors
i wont say theyre quite as horrible as bose though because at least sony doesnt use an  markup or pursue the same shady business practices as bose which once sued consumer reports for an unfavorable reviewdespite many reviews not favorable i purchased this unit to replace a similar sony unit i purchased in  that had quit working
i was satisfied for the first few uses but after several weeks the remote quit working
i replaced the factory provided batteries to no avail
this is a new problem not mentioned in other reviews
i will not replace this with a sony
their quality level seems to be decreasing lately
i had similar problems with a sony tv and replaced it with a better cheaper samsung lcd
john hif youre looking for a great  cd changer i highly recommend optimussive had it since  and it still works fineive had to clean it a few times but overall i was very impressedthis one by sony was possesed after  monthsi was highly disappointedis optimus more reliablei think so but sony still makes some kick ass speakersi got this the other day from amazon it was one of their re boxed units for 
luckily i didnt pay more for this
i trust sony so hopefully it will last for awhile
the description said minor damage to packing boxthis unit is warpedbowed on the top
i am using this in a garage so i will just keep it as there are no more  ones left
sure wish amazon would have been truthful with their description
i did try playing one cd and it worked fine
hopefully it will last for awhilei bought this disc changer but no remote and no instruction and no  color cord
looks like someone is using before send it to me
the sound is very very low
i will not return but think of some way how to order the remote and the instruction for this
thank youits a shame that just because olympus camera stopped making these type of memory cards that the people who want to sell theirs want so much
sure the card works fine but i could get g memory on compact flash for what we have to pay for a mb card for an older camera
next time ill buy my girlfriend a newer camera rathern than another one of these cards
a shamethe cds are for being used for live recording finalizing the disc usually produces a recording error although they do workalso the surface is a little too slippery making writing on it with a sharpie not as good as othersi bought this product about a year ago because of its router and bridge function and presumably linksys reputation
i wanted to network my two kids computers at the other end of the house through the phoneline
i have the netgear pa card a great product in their computers
installation of the hpro was easy but performance poor
my connection speed both ethernet and phoneline dropped sharply and became slightly better than my old k
linksys tech support which was very marginal took several phone calls and a run around between markedly different  cents opinions finally after reaching someone who knew advised me to upgrade the firmware
that part actually was easy and improved the speed some but still slow
linksys finally admitted this was a known issue with this product and were working on newer upgrades at some point in the near future
fortunately i was still within my  days and returned it for a refund
instead i got a separate router dlink di  phoneline bridge netgear pe both of which work great
maybe you will have better luck than me but i cannot recommend this linksys producti purchased and successfully installed this product in september   i was quite satisfied with it until recently
the problem began when i switched dsl providers
i cannot get the router to function properly with the new dsl service
ive gone so far as to have a networking technician out to look at it
as near as we can tell the router is not picking up a gateway from the new dsl servicemy extreme dissatisfaction with linksys is because their customer service is very poor and because they have not updated the firmware for this product in over  yearswith regard to  linksys apparently does not assign case numbers to help calls
consequently when i tried a fix that didnt work and called back in i would have to start from the beginning quottell us what the lights on the router are doing
tell us what the lights on the modem are doing
now power cycle the modemquot  etc
with a different technician
the technicians have a very limited knowledge
one went so far as to say she couldnt help me further because internet explorer  doesnt work well with the router
thats bologna the browser is just a container for information
another kept trying to pawn the problem off on my dsl provider even though i have a connection via the modemwith regard to  pppoe protocols can change
given that i cant get a gateway for my service maybe they need to update their firmwareim going to get rid of this router and do what i should have done in the first place hardwire some cat cable in my house
my recommendation to others is that you look at different solutions
it seems that linksys does not want to provide sufficient support for this producthomepna will be passed up by wireless options the new electrical networking protocol etc
so it might not make sense to purchase it anyway
perhaps linksys is just focusing its attention on newer technologiesthe len seems to work fine only had it a few hours but it does take great photos
however this len should come with an adapter that allows attachment of the es lens hood
did not come in the package
 discount but i have to buy a  adapterblurry picture
they should be fast  but in low light it can not get anything in focus  at least not easily and auto  mostly need to use manual focus
now i totally forgot that i am an older man  do not try video shooting with this lens unless that camera is on a tripod
no is i knew this one but did not know how much i need iti followed every word of the instruction but cant get the pc card connect to it
i tried other  pc card diff
brand
no dice
i tried another dlink p
wired
it seems that everytime i switched ap my pc card had signal but very unstable
but after a while the singal was gone again
then by switching to another ap the singal was back
forget it
i got a more expensive linksys ap w  port switch
plug and play
better user interface and better looking i think
i was lucky that i was able to get a very good deal at amazon product seems to be ok but if you run into any trouble forget about it
dlink tech support is clueless
they cant speak english and they have no knowledge of their own products much less basic networking
i bought a dlink wireless usb nic along with this product
tech support could not even tell me what one of the two products was at fault
im returning both items and im getting a linksys router and nic
you get what you pay for and i recommend you pay a little extra for another wireless brandhi all i wanted to share my cable internet connection with my laptop i use downstairs and bought the dip broadband router and dwl pc card
i got the router hooked up and working right away and then loaded the software and pc card into my laptopit worked for  minutes and then quiti then reinstalled it all and the same thing happened
i upgraded the firmware for the laptop and nothingi tried all the fixes in the manual with no luckthen after hours of this i read something on the net again about firmware again and upgraded the routers firmwarethen boom
it workeduntil i rebootedi upgraded the firmware a second time and boom
it worked again and then kept working
when i reboot my desktop with the router i sometimes have to go to the setup page and renew the ip setting to get it to work again with the wireless pc cardthis will happen if i turn the power off to the router and modem too at shutdown but it seems to be a reliable connection otherwise
i love having my cable speed on my laptop
i dont like the way dlink ignores the common firmware problem and still sells its products with old firmware and no notification
when you go to the homepage for help you dont see anything about upgrading firmware as a fix and i learned of the firmware fix here
when you go to dlinks page it should be written in large fontsyou must upgrade the firmware
i believe that products should work right out of the boxim not sure if im keeping it yet but so far so goodthis radio receives am fm and all seven weather alert vhf channels
notably it does have an alert mode where audio is muted until the homeland security folks or nws sends an alert tone that will activate the radios alarmit may be powered by  aa batteries or by a supplied wall power supply ul listed
it has a about a  inch telescoping antenna
it is available from a number of sources in the  to  rangeoverall audio quality is sufficient and clear for this small radioam reception is poor poor sensitivity and selectivity
yet it will receive the major am stations so long as they are moderate in strength or better
forget weaker stationsfm is better with more reasonable sensitivity and selectivity
i was able to receive and separate a dozen or more fm stations in my above average fm rf strength areamy local nws channel  was received adequately  sensitivity is probably average at best
so it will likely not receive the weaker nws signals
ive not yet observed the alert function sound off
which is my main reason for acquiring this radio
quality of construction appears to about what you would expect for the price cheap
i paid about  plus shipping
the performance is about what i expectedthis lens seemed a little soft
not as good as my  zoom
i sold it within just a couple of daysi was rather disappointed with the mm f as a whole
the iq contrast and sharpness are subpar from the perspective of a nikon traditionalist
i frequently shoot with some great lenses on my da mm f mm f vr mm f vr and mm f all producing incredibly detailed poster sized enlargements with sharp detail
however the mm just couldnt compete
i found the lens limited to an aperture of  or above in order to capture useful detail
post processing of images to improve contrast and color proved to be just too time consuming when using this lens
frankly nikon should be ashamed of manufacturing such a mediocre product
if youre shooting with a dx body it may be an acceptable lensbut avoid this on an fx bodybottomlinenikon should either retire this lens or drastically reduce its priceperformance at each stop fthis lens is unusable at f
very low resolution and poor contrast all over
chromatic aberrations ca are pervasive from the center to the edges
it will ruin any picture
 fthe center performance improves drastically
contrast goes up noticeably and ca goes down to very low levels still there
the midframe is still fuzzy and ca is observable
towards the edges the fuzziness and ca is still unacceptable for a prime lens
 fnow center performance is impeccable
excellent contrast and no hint of ca
the midframe is still somewhat fuzzy but the relative clarity and contrast is improved over f
unfortunately the edges still disappoint still poor contrast and ca better than f though
 fthe center is flawless
excellent contrast no ca high resolution
the edges improve dramatically very good contrast and very little ca
the fuzziness is still there for the midframe pretty much at the same level reached at f
 fok now were talking
excellent performance all overmy opinionthe performance of this lens is very poor below f particularly so considering its a prime lens
at f is a mess and at f its only good in the center quite useless for low light photography again considering its a prime lensstopped down to f this lens is very good for landscape photography also its a very small and light adding very little weight to your bagin short you are paying for a max aperture of f when the lens is only good at f maybe a third of a stop lessand over
at the current msrp this lens is completely overpriced
the nikon  fg is far better for much less money yes i know that its a dx lensalternative  samyangmany times better than the  fd is the samyang  f which also goes by the name of rockinon and bower but its the exact same lensthe samyang is an optical marvel which can put the equivalent zeiss to shame
leaving the fact that its manual focus same as zeiss and older nikon mms the samyang is the absolut bang for the buck
nothing comes close to it
considering its manual focus changes the equation a little bit and levels the playfield with the other  primesif you have no problems with manual focus if you can live with it then the samyang is the bargain of mm prime lenses and an absolute winner irrespective of the pricealternative  sigmanote i sold my samyang to buy the new sigma mm fthe difference between the sigma and the nikon is abysmal
gigantic
staggeringthe improvement over the  fd is far beyond what you can expect from the price differencethe sigma is sharp and contrasty  f
it also has less distorion less vigneting better contrast and significantly less optical aberrations than the nikon  fagainst the samyang is neck to neck
below f  f the sigma is better
f goes for the samyang
f and above is a tiethe big bonus of the sigma over the samyang is the autofocus
it nails it at f   out of  times
incrediblerecommendationsave some extra money and get the sigma  f which is lightyears ahead of this nikonif the price for the sigma is way above your budget then go for the samyang  f which is a phenomenal optical marvel and again far far better than this lens
the only caveat is that is manual focus only with green dot confirmation thoughif manual focus is not your cup of tea and dont have the budget for the sigma then consider a zoom lens which will give you a reasonable iq at mm and additional focal lengthsif you still want to go for this lens be warned that it has very poor iq up to f and only acceptable on average at f and as i said is flawless at fas of this moment i wouldnt pay more than  for a second hand copy of this lens
anything above that given the alternatives is wasting your moneythis lens was bought for my novice wife who at the time was just getting into photography and while i realize this is our fault for not doing more research i wish nikonnikkor was more upfront about what lenses will work with the internal autofocusthe lens is top notch but for anyone looking for an autofocus lens this is not onewellhere goesi bought the lens for its alleged low light performanceat the time i owned thw nikon  gto my surprisethe  was very soft wide open and not as sharp as the amazon is a great place to purchase anything due to the best customer support in the industryi returned the order the gone of my favorite hunks of nikon glanjimit is very slow and has flare particularly when using flash
i sacrifice the zomm and use  f insteadi bought nikon n with this lense for my dad a few years back
but it has been a totally diappointing experience as the lense is not sharp at alli have used minolta and other slrs i feel the conventional mm zoom would have been a wiser choice
but i had decent expectations about nikon which i regret nowthe images come out soft and even a bit blurry it is slow to focus and makes a lot of noise
i bought the sigma mm and am much happier with it and its have a very wide fieldi am so happy with this lens
i think this is a keeper
i sometimes meet people who say that it is a lot better to have vr
this may not have it but quality and sharpness is excellent
i used it for sports and portrait
it is a fantastic lens that will surely have space in bagi had been birding with a tamron  f vc zoom that i purchased used  like new on amazon for  and wanted to step up to the next level without breaking the bank on an exotic telephoto lens
i purchased the nikon  f used  like new condition here on amazon for about 
the lens did arrive in like new condition and i slapped in on my d and took it birding right away
i was immediately disappointed with its overall performancemy d is one of the best focussing cameras on the market and could not drive this lens to focus fast enough to capture birds even slightly on the move
also the photos that were produced were mushy when the lens was wide open
after experimenting a few days with the lens i realized that i could get relatively sharp images at about f
unfortunately this is just too small an aperture to get the shutter speed up where it is needed to capture birds sharply even with iso cranked way up
the difference between mm and mm was really not that much either not enough to justify carrying around the extra weight over the m zoom lens
finally the vr in this lens in the original vr i technology and it doesnt even compare to the vc technology in the tamron lensi have owned vr ii lenses such as the nikon mm and i now proudly own my first vr iii lens the nikon  f vr
nikon has made great advances with each generation of vr technology
the vr in the nikon  is dated just like the af screwdrive focusing
i have a d that i sometimes use for birding and of course this lens wont even auto focus with that camera due to the lack of an internal focus motor like many dx cameras
after a week i put this lens on ebay where i thankfully recouped my  to put down on another lenswhat i ended buying and what is now serving me wonderfully on my birding adventures is a nikon mm f prime lens
that lens is sharp wide open
i also noticed that  of my bird pictures where zoomed out at mm anyway so im really not missing the lack of a zoom
also this lens being much faster at f allows me to crank the shutter speeds way way up to the point that vr is not missed at all even hand held
finally the nikon mm f takes the nikon x teleconverter giving me mm at f sharply when i feel like i need the added reach
note the mm f lens is cheaper new than the nikon mm way cheaper than the just newly release nikon mm
i found my gray market copy new for  and the tc x for  at adorama yes a bit more than the  i paid for the nikon mm but so worth it
i now see the catch lights in the birds eye  of time and whats that worthif you really have what this lens costs new to spend on a birding lens please do yourself a favor and dont buy this archaic pig of a lens
research birding lenses a bit more and do check out the nikon mm f
even without the tc you will get better cropped images at mm than the  lens at mm
if you have the used price to spend on a birding lens i would save your money and make do with a mm either the nikon or a tamron and just crop your images until you can buy something better
theyll be sharper youll be richer and your back wont hurt nearly as bad
happy birdingat  this lens should be mint straight from the factory
my copy failed to autofocus properly and appeared to have serious backfocus issues
although the silent wave motor made for very quick focusing times if the copy had been focusing properly it made a pronounced metalonmetal or metalonplastic highpitched scraping sound at times
i understand this is endemic in many copies
lastly i did not think i would miss the added focal length of a mm or mm but that extra mmmm range really does make a difference and makes this lens less usable for dslrs
more importantly when focused by chance the optics did not produce sharpness substantially superior to my other less expensive dx lenseson the other hand this lens is not as heavy or large as other reviewers have noted
i would have no problem carrying the mm all day every day
perhaps my review would have been different if i received a different copy
but for  this should never happen
we as consumers should not be forced to return substandard equipment in order to ultimately get a copy that workscheck the quality control of this lens when you buy
mine had severe front focus problems
even when i selected the auto focus sensor the lens still had focusing issues 
the lens was soft to f
at f the images were incredibly poor
in my  years of photography i have never seen a lens this bad
to make sure i borrowed a friends vr
this  lens had better color saturation contrast and accurate auto focus
not only that but it was sharper
to get the  as sharp i had to stop down to f
i tried to get another sample but they were out of stock so i just returned it
i know a lot of people rate this lens  stars and i understand that ever now and then you get a bad sample but this lens had multiple problems
on the positive side it is not as big and heavy as some people claim
it balances well on my d and the autofocus is fast
i will be looking into the  the price was fantastic almost unbelievablehowever the drive was doadead on arrival
it was not well packed which may have contributed to its failurei had to try the drive in two different pcs before confirming it was not working properlyi did not appreciate the time it took to figure out what the heck was going on and i was fixing a pc for a neighbor who needed his pc back quicklythis was an unusual problem with products from amazon
when i spoke to customer service i sensed a bit of disbelief from the repagain unusual for amazonhowever an rma was issued with a label and i returned the drive for a full refundthis product needed to be more clear because it makes it look lie it is a sata drive but it is actually a ide
but it did come in a reasonable time
but as  i said they need to spend more time describing the product so people dont mistake it for something useful reviewers were happy they got a new hd and  reviewers were very disappointed they got a used hd
how can you tell what youre buying
i will be shopping elsewhere for hard drives until the newused status of the merchandise becomes more explicitthis drive is very difficult to install in some computersespecially if you have winxp
get a western blue drive instead
i sent this one backthese drives might be new but chances are theyve been sitting in an unopened box on a shelf for  years
granted i did expect that to be the case but as soon as i plugged it in it gave me the notorious death click noise
i promptly returned it and wound up buying a used one since i knew it worked upon shipping
i never bought a used hard drive but for these old ones it might be worth itordered received used drive
while drive works i do not know the history of this drive or how much usable life is leftsigns that you might have a used drive didnt come in original manufacturer package
modelserial not on outside of box drive may be in heatsealed antistatic bag but no moisture absorber ie
silica inside bag
bag does not have tearoff top drive might have scratches on it on side or end indicating it was installed already drive date of manufacture on label is years in the past inspecting drive smart data reveals significant powerup hours or  of powerup cycles that a new drive would not have
need an easy way to check this
download a bootable linux live dvd like mint gnome or mate edition and use the disk utility to check
the nice thing about this is that it runs off the dvd and you dont need to install any software or even format the drive under testif reliability is important i recommend spending extra and buying a new drivei dont have a problem with sellers of used items if it is clearly labelled as such but the product page never mentioned used refurbished removed from working equipment etcin the absence of this information one can be reasonably expected to receive a new product not a used one
to me this is baitandswitchfyi i ordered from seller buyaccessoriesi hope you have found this usefulthis camera has a very annoying problem when you push the button to take the picture there is about a half second delay before the picture is actually taken
this is really not good if you are hoping to take pictures of kids candid photos or pictures of anything in motion
other cameras are less expensive and dont have this horrible problemaside from this problem if the picture is taken in bright light and at close range the colors look wonderfulthe kodak dx would be a very nice camera except that battery life is very poor
im lucky to get  pictures before the batteries go dead i use rechargeable batteries with the easy share dock and aa alkalines
kodak is aware of the problem
here is their response to my query about poor battery lifebecause batteries are chemical products involving internal chemical reactions their performance may deteriorate with prolonged storagenimh rechargeable batteries if not used for a while may need to be reconditioned as you would when using them for the first timeotherwise deactivation of the internal reactants may cause decreased capacity which causes premature termination of charging
in other words the batteries will not charge completely even though the dock indicates they haveif this happens we have a couple of recommendations
first make sure you have the latest firmware
if you dont consider updating your camera to the latest version
you can locate the update by going toonce there choose your camera from the list
the next page will offer all the available software for your model including any current firmware updates  if available
the firmware download will have a readme file that contains the directions for performing the updateonce you have successfully completed the update we recommendconditioning your battery the way you would if it were being used for the first time as we mentioned above
it is important that you be sure you always have a fully charged battery
to do so place the camera on the kodak easyshare camera dock
when the charge light turns green all three green lights are lit for a dock ii then remove the camera from the dock for a minimum of  minutes and place it back on the dock
the  minutes the camera is off the dock are the key to correct rechargingfor a new or uncharged battery
repeat this same process until the combined charging time while the light is red on the dock equals a minimum of  hoursonce you have completed this charging process we recommend that you leave the camera on its dock and intermittently check it for power remove from the dock for a while then replace it
if you use yourcamera frequently of course you will always have a charged battery because you will be removing and replacing it
if you do not use your camera frequently periodically remove the camera from the dock and take a few test shots
doing this assures a properly maintained battery sothat you will have lots of powerdo not make the mistake of trying to charge the kodak photolife lithium battery crv that comes with the camera
it is not rechargeable and an attempt to do so could result in leakage
also please be aware that the camera will only charge the kodak kaahr nimh battery
nonkodakbatteries or individual aa rechargeable batteries including kodak batteries are not compatible with this charger
if you need a separate charger they are available at the kodak online storeremember your cameras dock is only charging when it displays the red light
if the light is green that means it is either done charging or has detected another type of battery it cannot chargeplease note
your cameras batteries lose power during image reviews and when adjusting camera settings
use of the lcd screen is also a big drainif i had known about the battery problem i never would have bought this camera
did you read the section above when kodak states the batteries will not charge completely even though the dock indicates they have
we can send robots to mars but we cant make a battery charger that knows when a battery is really charged
what the hell good is a battery charger that doesnt know if a battery is charged or not
so just because the little green light says charged you cant believe it
i tried the firmware upgrade and that was futile no help at all just a waste of timeas is i now carry at least  aa alkalines they last about  pictures if you keep the lcd turned off whenever i use this camera away from home because you never know when it will just shut down by itself from weak batteriesin defense to the camera i will say that it takes good pictures in daylight night pictures with flash are worthless i like the fact you can add other lenses and the built in video recorder is ok the included software is nice
it includes options to adjust tint brightness crop etc the photo album is easy to use and makes saving the pictures easy
also the removable compactflash card is a nice featureso if you decide to get this camera be prepared to buy lots of aa batteries
personally i will never buy another kodak product
i dont think its right to sell a product with an apparent design flaw and then offer the consumer a in my opinion worthless remedy
these cameras should have been recalled and the consumer offered a full refund or a camera that works the way it shouldfirst the kodak branded battery that was included with the camera was awful
the camera could literally take  shots immediately after charging all night
of course when i wanted them to fix the problem i had to send in the camera for  weeks rather than kodak just sending me a battery that worksin addition kodak recently turned off  or quit advertising  their tech support 
theyre trying to make everyone use their online knowledge base
i understand that but with the problems highlighted in the reviews of this product i would think theyd offer a higher level of supportin agreement with other comments the battery life is awful
i carry  sets of backup aa batteries when i take the camera away from homethe camera itself takes pretty good pictures in the right environment
that is as far as the flash can reach
in low light it cant focus and you cant do so manually  result is terrible pictureson the plus side the software that comes with the camera is simple but effectivei bought these headphones after briefly trying a friends pair
the price was low but so is the comfort level
they sit a little too tight on my ears so i dont keep them on for more than  minutes at a time
also the fabric covering the speakers wears out and rips off over time
my friends pair eventually snapped in half though he is a heavy headphone useralso the headphones block out low frequency noises pretty well especially on an airplane but i can still perfectly understand what people are saying
part of my intention with these headphones was to block out peoplenoise so i can better concentrate at worki should have read some of these reviews because most of them are right
the good and bad
first the bad  they hurt after a while
ive gotten used to wearing them but they still make my ears sore after a while
the folding design and the thin padding are the problem
another person mentioned a buzzing sound when turning on the noise cancelling switch
mine started to do that after a while and now i cant use the noise cancelling option
its feedback from microphone and maybe the mic got dirt or some water in it
who knows
i think the sound is poor and could be a little better
ive used other headphones that sound better
they seem as though they could break pretty easily
you have to be careful foldingunfolding them because they feel as if you tug too hard they could snap
they dont sit all that well and sometimes fall off when looking down
plus they look sort of silly on your head because of the folding designthe good  they did help reduce the noise when they didnt start buzzing after a while
they fold up which is great for the traveler
the price is rightso you have to ask yourself  are these right for me
im going to try another pair like the jensens that also fold and have the nd feature
i know i could spend a lot more and get a better headphone the bose are awesome if you are willing to pay that much
for frequent travlers  spend the extra money because they are worth it
maybe i will have to fork out the extra  if i cant find one at around the same price as the jensenaiwathese headphones are uncomfortable to me they are sprung too tightly with no adjustment
the noise cancelling does appear to work but i wanted to use them to attenuate the noise from adjoining cubicle dwellers
it does this effectively if you turn up the volume but so do regular earbud headphones
the hiss with the noise cancelling turned on is not something that you could stand without some high volume music to go along with it
i havent taken a plane ride with them so im not sure how they would fare in that application
also it uses  aa battery not  aaai wish i had checked the amazon customer reviews before i purchased these aiwa noise canceling headphonesthe tension in the headband was too high so they hurt my ears when i wore them
more importantly they tended to buzz electronically when i used them with my laptops  totally defeating any noise canceling benefit they mightve providedi was looking for a less expensive alternative to my sennheiser hdc s which are excellenti guess i shouldve known bettercons this camera is heavy and bulky
for the price it is only around  mega pixels which isnt good
i had this camera for a while then the zoom wouldnt come all the way out and it says system error every time  i turn it on so i cannot use it anymorepros  the pictures turn out decent
it is a solid camera but do not drop it on the lens contraption because you will have the same problem of it not turning on and its garabe nowi was disappointed with this tripod
it is cheap and flimsy
it works barely and that is the most i can say for it
i can see now that there are many better on the marketi used to like my viking mb cf card a lot
i had such a card for more than a year
in that period i used it in my camera
its filled up for several times
also occationally i use a card reader simpletech to writeread that card to transfer some big files between computers
its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading i got cf card error on my camera
fortunately after i delete a few pictures i could move on
i gave the card to  other people so i dont know how its doing nowafter that i purchased another viking mb half year ago
i used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
now i am getting consistent cf card error message on my camera even after reformat for several times while i dont have that problem if i use another cardone theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card
i can not verify though
anyway i will have to buy another card now and it wont be viking for this time one month later i contacted with their customer support
they gave me a number for return and i mailed back my damaged cf card
they sent back a new one in a week
the new one is working fine so far
the exchange was not difficult
they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt
they only verified the serial number
thats goodi really wanted to give this unit a good review because i really liked having the  megs availableive owned this card for the last  months and have been going back and forth with viking to get it replaced
they are very efficient at giving a replacement but i have recieved defective replacement units twice so far and have been without its use for almost two months
i paid twice what it is today which doesnt bother me technology speedthe replacements have not accepted any data beyond  meg and then crashed no matter which computer which cf reader my laptop or pda it doesnt work and now i am frustrated
all my  meg sandisk mr flash and kingston work fine
if you want a reliable cf card i think you may want to look elsewhereyesterday i was going to order this card but there was a wait list
today now that the rebate has expired the card ships within  hours
the same thing happened with the viking mb smartmedia card
something very wrong at amazon
contacted customer service who were entirely not helpful as they just espoused the company policy of offering something that they will not ultimately honor
shame on you amazoni bought this specifically for dragon naturally speaking
it makes a myriad of mistakes even after spending days with it it was still mistaken ts for vs and other similar mistakes
this is all after i went through  very long training sessions in dragon
dont be fooled by the fact that voice recognition is in the product title it is not a good choice unless you only want to use it for windows voice commands which its able to do most of the time because there are only so many things you can sayas for audio quality its ok but not as good as a logitec that i bought locally from walmart
that goes for the voice recognition as well
i actually returned the logitech specifically becuase of the positive vr reviews on this
the logitec was by far better in both cases yet still not good enough for vr
its time to buy quality no more cheap fixesi bought this headset and have generally been disappointed for dragon dictation usage
the cyber acoustics ac is better at less price 
but adding an audio pod made the biggest difference in terms of quality
this website was awesome for explaining the everything  the difference when i bought these devices was pretty substantialnot well made sound quality very low i would not recommendspend a little more monry and get a better quality seti bought this to use with dragon speak naturally because so much of what i read about the one that comes with the software said to buy something better
but i have been utterly unable to get it to work at all with dragon speak
tried everything and i work in an is
department
its possible its just defective
felt comfortable buying it because of the koss name but its useless to me will have to return iti was looking for head phones with a usb connection to use with dragon
so i did a search on amazon for usb headphones and these came up
when i received them you can imagine my surprise to see no usb plug but mini phone plugs
they do seem to work just not what i wantedit never worked why because apparently you have to buy a separate component to power it up if your laptop isnt equipped with the compatible power source
they should at least put that part into the description before you go through all the trouble of trying to figure out why it doesnt work
by the way they are well aware of this because when you call customer support the first thing they ask is did you purchase a power jack not sure if thats what its calledfigure out if your computer will power it up before you purchasewhich is sort of a bummer i mean what good are earphones with a microphone built in if you dont have a separate volume control on it somewhere
you are instead forced to use your computers imprecise volume control which can be a pain when you get games that are too loud in one area or too soft in others or movies with the same problems
i wouldnt recommend this unless you really just want headphones for something that plugs into a maybe radio or something with an own easy to control volume knob on it somewherenot sure why but the mike doesnt work
i do like the headset very comfortable the price is right but if the mike doesnt work its of little use to meuncomfortable below average microphone decent soundbass and treble is decent but nothing extraordinarythese headphones are big and the headband can be a bit uncomfortable  especially after long usethe microphone is bad
i played a few pc games using these headphones and almost no one could hear what i said yes all my pc settings were correcti wouldnt recommend these headphones
look elsewherewant to save time
forget the cd players and get a flash memory unit
stay away from moving parts
anyway here are the gory detailsok i liked it at first
it did everything i wanted it to do  play mps in the car
i fact i loved itbut after a couple of months i found the problems to be so annoying that i have retired it for goodi just dont think its a quality machine
i would not recommend it because i have to believe that with this unit if its not one thing its another
the particular problem i had may not occur with all of them but its an indication that its not built well problem  my unit constantly stopped playing for no apparent reason
after weeks of frustration i found that if i squeezed it or smacked it it would play
i finally figured out that it thinks it has opened up and therefore stops playingi dismantled the unit what did i have to lose
and figured out that the tiny switch  the one that gets depressed by the protruding thing on the lid  is either not working as a switch or does not get correctly depressed by the lids switchpokerizer
i have tried to improve the poking by gluing stuff to the poker to widen and extend it but it hasnt worked
i think its the switch that doesnt workthe point is it is unfortunate that one stupid part ruins the device
i dont have confidence that this is a well tested well designed well built player
moving parts with low quality equals problems
you definitely get what you pay foras i said if it played without stopping all the time it would be just fine despite the little annoyances in its designother problems annoying problem  audio cds play but none of the functions work with audio cds
eg no stop forward back
nothing
you have to play the cd all the way through
period ridiculous software  what a pain naming the files
once you spend many hours doing it i guess its handy eats batteries
get the car kit or forget iti love being able to storea dozen albums on a single cd
the concept is great here
the execution leaves something to be desiredwhen you get this much music in one place you need a good ui top be able to pick out what you want to hear
the mojo does a decent good job of this but i was expecting much better from the reviews
the main display when playing music is rather disappointing  only giving one line of  to show the name of the music playing and  lines for other stuff
it lacks some basic play modes like play everything shuffled once and then stop
the battery life was pretty short and it would generally kill the batteries when i wasnt listening to it bc it had started playing in my bag  my bad for forgetting the hold switch but the design doesnt helpits also quite fragile
i tried taking it with me on bike rides and such for a short while but it really just couldnt deal
im talking roadbike rides not offroad
this wasnt even a real torture test
about  months after i got it it started going down hill  not playing some cds
getting stuck in the middle
now at the tender age of  months its all but worthless
it cant play mp cds for more than about  minutes before getting lost and even audio cds are starting to fail
it will play for a while and then just grind the laser head back and forth and spin the disk up and downi know amazoners tend not to consider very highly reviews complaining about broken hardware
but i think if you read youll see a trend with this one
i treated it very gently and it didnt last long at alli promised myself that if my old  crt monitor died my next monitor will be a lcdflatscreen
i looked all over for a reasonably priced  lcd monitor
most were in the  price range which was beyond what i was willing to spend
you can imagine how thrilled i was when i came across the  envision ene monitor on this site
it was highly ranked among the lcd monitor purchases being  or  on the list
i was even more pleased that it had such a high rating at  stars
and i was absolutely elated at the unbelievable pricei read the reviews on this site and everyone seemed to be so pleased with the color and picture clarity
however some people had some gripes about the way the text appeared on the screen
this is one of the reasons why i rated this monitor a  yes its that bad
i mean i was disappointed practically as soon as i got it hooked up
the negatives are far worse than the positivesnegatives the text is unclear and not sharp
i find that the text is distorted and fuzzy
i have to strain my eyes to read documents on the screen
i tried everything to make the text more clear including changing the font size resolution changing from the standard font style to cleartype etc etc
nothings worked
i tried various possible solutions that either made the problem worse or had no effect at all the color doesnt blow my mind
its no better than my old crt monitor and in some situations the color is worse
the colors are not as vivid or crisp as i thought they would be
some images have a grainy look to them the monitor also has an uncomfortable glare that i cant seem to reduce even when i lessen the brightness or contrast the monitor does not come with a complete manual
instead you have to go to the company website to read an online manualpositivesgreat looking sleek designthe screen is really 
everyone is familiar with monitors that are supposedly  but the screen is only   etcyou are not cheatedi didnt have to do much display positioning when i got the monitor
sometimes with new monitors you have to do some fiddling around with the horizontal and vertical positioning in order to get the screen to look just right
i didnt have to do any of thatno dead pixelslike i said before i purchased the envision ene monitor based on the fantastic reviews and the price but im extremely disapointed
i thought i could live with the negative features but i cant
everytime i look at the screen it hurts my eyes
either because the glare is too bright or the horrible distortion of the texti know im in the minority with my opinion on this product but im afraid i cant recommend it to anyoneim sending mine back and i will be looking for another lcd monitor or possibly i will go back to a crtunfortunately if i get another lcd monitor i will have to spend much more but as someone said before in referring to this monitor you get what you pay forgetting a monitor better than this one and having to pay more is worth the investmentpaper paper paper its  we are still useing paper in speakers  sounds ok i fell like i will blow them becuz of the paper but for paper it sounds ok and for  bucks  i guess its ok if u only hook them up to ur deck dont use a amp the paperi bought these speakers and checked before ordering to make sure they included grills description listed grills included
sadly i opened the box and found no grills
i called pyle and asked why the description and box list grills as part of the product but product packaging did not include them
the tech support guy could not give me an answer other than no they do not have grills
i asked if they were available for purchase as an addon
same response nofirst off
i didnt buy these on amazon bought at walgreens
only  bucks
i hookup to my laptop and can barely hear anything with the volume of my computer all the way up
hooked them up with ipod a little better but not much better
im not gonna complain to much because its only  bucks but theyre garbage in my opinionits better than nothing if your intregrated sound card fails and you need some audio
however the volume is exeeding weakok  sony srsp passive speakers each  inchesw x  inchesh x  inchesd amazon
i attempted to use these to increase the the volume on my g phone however my phones tiny speaker was louder than thesei also tried on other devices sansa mp player no speaker on device headphone jack only zen mp player headphone jack only acer laptop and still way to low
even my acer laptop speakers cheapest speakers on the planet so i thought were louder than these sony passive speakers
my conclusion is the sound of them is clear but they are passive and without power they just have no volume
i did keep them as they could come in very handy with my mp players that have only a headphone jack to hear radio etc
especially in a power outage
hope this helps othersi bought these srsp sony speakers for about  dollars and knew it was going to be nothing special
when i plugged them into my laptop i expected the speakers to amplify a louder volume of music compared to the stock laptop speakers and it turned outthe laptop won by a wide margin
i tuned the volume up to max on the laptop and the sound was just too low coming out from the speakers
the product is just sad in every way in terms of quality and highly recommend that you do not waste your hard earned money on thisthis item rattles like crazy in my jeep now
ive only had it for  months and i have not abused it at all
the item is obnoxious
im thinking about taking it out of my jeep
reception is not great and i have a fire stick  foot on my jeep
too badi ran this cb dashmounted in my truck for nearly a year
the following sums up my experience with itthe goodthe matte finish black radio and mic blends in really well with most dark car interiors
i liked the way this radio looked installedthe front mounted mic frontfacing speaker and standard din size make it perfect for dashmount installations
i installed this radio right beneath my car stereo in the space where the little cubby was supposed to be
it screwed right into the available slots in the radio bracketthe channel display is easy to read and shows both the weatherband and the cb channelswith the combination of dual watch and the normal button you have a lot of options for monitoring different channels
you can run on a certain channel use the normal button to flip over and check traffic on  then flip back without turning the dialit has battery power input and remembers what the cb and weather channel you were on so you dont have to flip to it every time you turn on the ignition
some of the lowerend radios forget and reset to channel  if they only have one power wire and you want to have the radio come on with the ignitionthe scan feature works well if you are in unfamiliar territory or feeling particularly socialthe speaker is clear and loud
i didnt have any problems hearing or understanding peoplethe stock microphone is pretty decent for a lowend stock mic
it comes with an adequately sized cable good connections and it picks up ample signal
the transmit is as strong as your average stock radio and the decent mic signal makes for good modulationthe meter is very bright and easy to readthe radio has a fairly sensitive receive
it picks up ample signal basically the equivalent of a stock cobra  with the rf gain almost all the way upthe badsoundtracker feature is useless
from what i understand it is a compression technology that improves transmission between two radios but they both have to be running soundtracker for it to work
most of the truckers run old cobra s unidens galaxies strykers and so on none of which have soundtracker
the only thing soundtracker does to those signals is compress them
it makes them seem louder but it takes out a lot of the highslows in the vocal inflection and actually makes them a little more difficult to understand
i left it turned off which is just as well because the radio turns it off every time you turn off the ignition
maybe the radio doesnt like st either no good place to hang a mic
cobra built the radio to be mounted in a dash but they included a standard mic clip that screws onto the side of the radio
how are you supposed to clip your mic to the side of the radio when its in your dash
i would have rather seen them use a springloaded lanyard attached to the front or some other mounting option
the way it sits you have to screw your mic clip into something else  and put permanent holes in your vehicle
yikesthe radio doesnt have a control for rf gain
as i said the receive is fairly sensitive which is typically a good thing unless you dont have an rf gain and you drive through noisy environments like cities highways or basically anywhere people live and use cb radio
having that control over how much signal to pick up is critical in being able to hear the person you intend to hear especially in radios as sensitive as this onethe radio is a hair wider than a standard din unit
i had to shave plastic out of my mounting bracket to get it to fitthe uglyafter a few months of owning this radio and running it every time i had my truck on i started to notice a peculiar sound coming from the radio
it sounded like a tuning fork and it would gradually get louder and louder until it started to drive me a little batty
after i turned the radio off for a little while it would disappear but only if i let the radio sit
it seemed to be heatrelated
in colder weather it wouldnt do it until the truck warmed up then sure enough it was at it again
i turned the radio in for a new one thinking it was a defective unit
i was wrong
the new one did it as well just like the old one but only after a few months of use
i learned after a while not to use the unit fulltime on long trips
i would use it for a while then give it a break then turn it on again after some time
the breaks did the trick because it wouldnt make the noise as long as i didnt work it too hardthe thing that did me in on this radio and the reason i finally decided to replace it is the amount of noise it picks up that i have no control over
when i first put this radio in my truck i was using a magnetic antenna and it was perfect
eventually though i upgraded to a firestik and tuned it with an swr meter and as i upgraded it seemed like the radio was no longer a match for my antenna
dont get me wrong it picks up everything now
thats the problem
it picks up everything
transformer stations power lines people with swing kits five states over my windshield washer motor  everything
and i have no rf gain to control the noise and no anl or noise blanker to fight it either
with my new antenna the radio was doing a better job scaring me than helping me talk to people
so i had to turn it in for a model with more control
it got to the point where i had to have the squelch nearly to the stop just to cut out the noise and the noise itself was registering at  db on the meter
by the time i got all the noise squelched off i couldnt hear anything else that was going onthe bottom lineif installing a radio indash that blends with your car interior is an absolute must for you this is about as close as it gets excepting perhaps the one other frontfacing speaker unit ive seen by uniden
but be warned  you are going to have to control your signal level with your antenna instead of your radio
if you only ever plan to run this radio on a runofthemill  magnetic antenna you probably wont have the problems i had
but if you upgrade to something better down the road be prepared to hear a lot of noise
this radio has no defense against itand last but not least if you plan to use it daily choose a different radio
this would probably  be an ideal radio to throw in an rv or some other vehicle you travel with a few weeks a year to check the weather and channel  once in a while
in my experience however it isnt designed to be a daily beaterwith the right application and matching antenna this radio might be a good choice
if using a cb becomes part of your daily routine however you will ultimately outgrow this radioi had one of these on my car for a few years and noticed the rubber base protector had cracks
my old antenna looks like the pictures in amazon including base pad and cobra logo but the new one does noti noticed there was no cobra logo which is strange but im fine with that but the rubber base plate protector has been redesigned and is now terrible
where the old version was fairly thick and heavy duty the new redesign is as thin as a condom and only comes part way up the base
the magnet base without the protective covering is sharp and would scratch the paint if used without the coveri had a hard time because the base cover had slipped off the magnet during shipping and was difficult to get back on because of its thinness and small edge gripnew is not always better and ill stick with by old base plate cracks and all and just replace the upper partselectronics has been my profession for years and while the antenna would work fine for awhile im not going to try it
magnet mount antennas are often moved or removed for car washing security or other reasonsshame on cobra for the obviously bad designi do not recommend this cobra hg a  baseload medium magnet mount w cb antennado not have good radius with this antenna may work well if your driving by a truck stop or something but not good if you want to talk to someone more then a mile awayi bought this based on positive reviews
when first installed got swr down to  on channel  as this is my primary channel
lasted for about  weeks then swr went all over the place
thinking it was swr meter had a friend check it out with his meter and his showed swr all over the scale
move it an inch and it jumped up to over  moved it again about  inch further and hit beyond scale
determined it was a bad antenna
bought a wilson and swr was tuned down to  on  and remained there wherever it was mounted
double checked with friends swr meter and was same as mine
cannot recommend this antenna unless it was a defect but would not buy another based on experience of this onethe base of this antenna includes a rubber boot which does not stay in place
the antenna itself is tall and the magnet is relatively weak
this means the slightest brush with an overhead object tree branch beams in a parking garage etc causes the antenna to fall over
when the antenna falls over the rubber boot falls out of place leaving it hanging on by a very small area that is caught between the edge of the base and the roof of the vehicle
this makes it impractical to leave on your car most of the time in my case a jeep grand cherokeeso keeping this thing inside your vehicle is also a nightmare
the antenna element is so long and the coax cable is captive not detachable so you cant easily bundle it up and put everything away for storage
the element is just waiting to poke somebody in the eye if its not kept carefully out of the way in the rear cargo areaas for its performance even when tuned according to the instructions the antennas performance is lackluster
the beam pattern is the issue
it must be like a lopsided figure  with the strongest part of the beam moving around depending on exactly how the antenna bends in the airflow as the vehicle travels
perhaps the base does not couple well with the metal roof
i have no idea
its not worth trying to figure outi replaced this thing with a thruglass antenna brand with a t cb with weather band available here on amazon which outperforms it in every way
i thought the factory tint on my jeep would be a problem for the thruglass antenna but apparently not since the tint is nonmetallici had high hopes for this unit given what we paid for it but have had many problems
about half the dvds we have played in it have had serious sound problems as if you were turning the volume up and down randomly
it makes many movies unwatchable
plus you get plenty of picture freezes
most cdrmps that we have tried in it also had serious audio problems lots of pops and the like
these cdrmps play fine on other playersive had lots of problems with other toshiba products lately so my advice would be to avoid themyou can definitely do better for the low pricesonys in ear headplugs are discounted on amazon down to  pretty often and sound better
so do a lot of cheap sennheisersthey just lack clarity in the higher frequencies and have a muffled and too loud bassi bought these a year ago because they were rated a best buy in the under  headphone category in consumer reports
nothing could be further from the truth  too much bass no upper range khz and up and an overall muffled soundi own an old pair of seinnheisers that i use at home and cost me  nearly  years ago
they sound remarkably better  and i used a pair of koss  headphones as a comparisonthis is the second time i got burned listening to consumer reports audio advice and definitely the lastthe sony cd is a very unimpressive headphone even at dollar amount
then again most closed headphones at this price are a poor choicedeep bass is lacking badly but upper bass is exaggerated somewhat giving them a boomy fake bass soundmids arent much better  some midrange frequencies are very prominent and voices drill into my head in a rather fautiging manner and smear together with insturments to my displeasure
they also have a very hollow quality that probably has something to do with the closed headphone designtreble is very muted but lower treble is exxagerated and it makes the cds sound at first like they have a lot of detail which they dontimaging placement of insturments is poor
everything sounds like it is either coming from the center of my head or the right or left side there isnt much in the way of seperation otherwisethey also have a fairly cheap feel although they are reasonably comfortable  they dont clamp down on your ears overly hard and they are circumaural go around your ear not on top so the pressure is put on the area around your earsthey do sound better then other closed sony headphones in this price range like the mdrv but sound somewhat worse then the koss urs which are also closed and much worse then the open koss kscs which can be had for the same price
the next step up from the koss urs with a closed headphone is the sony mdrv which is around dollar amount  there isnt anything worth buying in betweenas always keep headphone listening volume reasonable  you can damage your ears very easily
as a general rule of thumb if you cant tell someone is talking to you when you are not engrossed in the music they are up too loudi bought a pair of these a few years ago for use at the radio station where i work
theyre uncomfortable the pads make my head itch and it makes a lot of noise when you move them
they look cool but thats about it
i got them at target for about  on an openbox buy and ended up leaving them at the radio stationdont get em
get optimus novas if you can find themproscheap indestructible light blocks out external sound really wellconspoor sound quality very poorly designed headband ear cups hurt my ears not comfortable too large cord extremely longthe bottom linethey crank out way too much bass and not enough treble
id steer clear but they are cheap and readily availablethe first indication should be the price these headphones are only  dollars
its hard to nail down sonys market for these things exactly but judging by their appearance and reference headphones name theyre trying to pass these things off as high output sound booth style phonesthe headphones have nice large earmuff style cups on them with foam padding and a cloth cover
they fit my ears fine and i have big ugly stickout ears so chances are these things wont have lawsofphysics conflicts with too many peoples ears
i did notice that the headband is a little tight and it certainly isnt very flexible
if you have a melon head you may not want to wear these for long periods of time
the headband is also very hard to adjust at least on my pair and is so tight it feels like im about to break it every time i resize it
it does stay put very well though so it is likely a setandforget sort of thing unless multiple people will be using the phoneshows the sound
well it stinks
but it can be fixed
sony boasts a bass response of  hz for these phones which is a boldfaced lie
if you did get the cones on these things to resonate at  hz you certainly wouldnt be able to play much else through them at the same time
as far as concrete audio frequencies go these phones do no better than any other cheap ones on the market but sony decided to atone for this by jacking up the bass volume on these things to insane levels
i couldnt get much else out of these headphones without creative use of a treble boost and an equalizer and even then only at moderate volumes
its trendy to pack entirely more bass than you realistically need these days just check out just about everyones custom car stereos but in a pair of headphones its ludicrous
if the audio gizmo you want to use these with doesnt have good bass and treble controls tough
in that case you arent getting much out of these phonesif you can tone the bass down a bit these phones are average and quite suitable for noncritical listening but professional headphones they aint and accurate their sound rendition isnt but cheap they are
i personally dont like them a whole lot but your mileage may vary
not recommendedi like how these work but they need to be replaced every to months
if they lasted longer i would like them morethese headphones have lousy audio quality
theres almost no bass they sound tinny and they easily distort at higher volumes
theyre good for spoken word but not much else
and the cord just long enough to possibly fit my player into my pocket while these are on my headi picked these up because i like to run and thought some lightweight headphones would be more comfortable for longer runs
i was wrong
these are indeed extremely lightweight but thats not a good thing
they never stay in place and i am constantly readjusting them
they always feel like they are about to fall off of my head
its very annoying and i have already stopped using them for this reasonif youre considering some lighter headphones for working out with its just not worth it to save a gram here or there in weight
headphones like these are never really heavy in the first place so just get some normal ones and skip thesesound quality was fine
i dont expect theater quality sound from any pair of cheap headphonesi got this for gym use
the cable is shorted than what it should be for normal ellipticaltreadmill use
now one side stopped working
when the cable is held is one particular position the sounds comes back indicating its a contact issue where the cable joins the ear piece
this ear phone is comfortable but i do not recommend iti am on my second pair of these headsets both of which have had a shorting problem with the left earphone
as a runner i think perspiration is the culpritso i have had to downgrade my initial review
i would not recommend these for folks who sweatthey sound great for the price
very light plastic construction which fit snugly in ears and on head
i run  miles at a time and this headset stays put
they are not hinged anywhere hence do not fold and will not fit in a small pocket
but they are flexible enough to squeeze into a larger onethe sound is good
the fit is good
the wire is terrible
they last a few weeks and then break  maybe ok for supergentle listening but movement yanks the connections loose either at the earpiece or the connector
opened a new one which had a dead channel
sent it to the warranty address on the package  it was returned asis
no moreupdate despite my objections i decided to order another pair of these
now theyre  not the  or so that was already overpriced
what are sony andor amazon thinking
got to be a joke
no more no way
instead look at the koss kph at 
looks nearly identical sounds as goodcord is way too short that is my biggest issues here
i kept pulling it out of my phone on the planethe reason to have a headphone like this is to have something that stays on the head better than ear buds while doing physical activity
these do not do a very good job at that
the headset is too rigid it does not conform well to the head
it does adjust for ear position but that does not do much to keep the headset fit more snug on the head
they will fall off when you are doing moderate physical activity
and it doesnt take much force for something to swipe them off like a strong wind
i can get that with ear buds so in a way this product failsthe cord also needs at least another foot in length
my height is as average as a guy can be at  feet
but you cannot put your phone or ipod in your pant pocket without the cord tugging too much on the headset and eventually pulling them off
the cord is just too short to extend from the head to the bottom of typical pant pockets without being to tight
plan on buying a separate arm strap or having a shirt or top with a pocket closer to the headspeaker sound is the only thing about this product that is passable
its not high fidelity but good enough when on the gothe price is cheap
but that really means nothing if the headset cant stay on the head reliably when moving aroundill do a simple prosandcons here but will summarize by saying i was highly disappointedprossound is excellent and rich
thats itconsvery short cordbuds pop out of the ear easily although i had no trouble with the headset falling offdifficult to place buds in the ear for good soundbiggest negative rough edges casting flash on the earbuds require the development of ear callusesa mere minute or two caused serious discomfort
not acceptablea couple of months later after i did develop the required calluses the band started to stretch so they now fall off easily
sighi would give it a three star rating however the left speaker just stopped working
i have had these for nine months and have not abused them
looking at the reviews i found out that this is a known problem with these headphones and that they have been discontinued
usually i would have caught this on the front end as i try to thoroughly read the reviews before purchasing anything
in addition they look like over the ear like scoshe but they are not
they are over the head with the speakers resting in the ear and facing forward so that the full volume is not directed into the ear like ear buds but past the ear
while this is a satisfactory method of delivering the music i found that this design coupled with the over the head style kept them from staying firm on my head
they often shifted or fell off when i bent over when doing exercises
i would not recommend them go with the scoshe over the ear headphones insteadsony made a folding headset with the same vertical in the ear concept
the driver was slightly larger allowing for a much fuller sound reproduction
i had forgotten about that head set when behold i found an old pair stashed with my old electronics
i was so impressed i was attempting to order what i thought would be a similar driver
the driver on the one i received seemed more like it was designed in comparison for the speech range
i wish sony would remake the old set i just described  we need to keep the vertical head set concept alive
i realize the one they still sell in the usa is more of a one size fits all so they make this one only
the larger size is just slightly larger but worth the fidelity it provides and for most people just as comfortableno bass ok for voice but otherwise a cheap pair of headphones
i wish sony would make a better quality pair of headphones in this style over the head small and collapsible for running or travelingwhat you pay its what you get
thats all i have to say for this product
thanks for reading
li purchased this headset because i wanted an over the head style because i have very small ears
it worked great with no wind
as soon as a wind gust it blew backwards
did not work for small ears
sound quality was goodthese headphones hurt the insides of my ears and the sound quality is not the best
i wouldnt buy them againi wanted earbuds on a light headband but these dont fit in my ear far enough to hear the sound well and are quickly uncomfortable in my ear tooinitial purchase  good headset
its very comfortable  has good sound quality and is much easier to clean than ones with rubberfoam ear pieces
i have bought  sets in the last  months
not as replacements but so i wouldnt have to plugunplug with my different music sources
my only complaint is that wire tangles like all ear pieces
highly recommendupdate   apparently sony stopped making these leaving whats left to scalpers
the price has jumped from under   to over  if anyone know of a good alternative im interestedi have used the sony mdra sport headphones for many years
they were great because they sat in my ears comfortably and had great sound
plus they didnt slip off my head were fairly sweat resistant and would fold up nicely into my gym bag
unfortunately one day the sound went out in one ear and i needed to get a replacement
i was really dismayed to find out that they dont make that model anymore
it was a really good product even if each pair only lasted about  yearsnow ive come to learn that no one makes good folding headphones that sit in the ear
i dont really like using ear buds when i exercise and all the other styles are annoying
for one theyre a real pain to deal with when theyre not in your ears
i like to just drop the headphones onto my shoulders like a collar when im not using them
also earbuds are not that comfortable when you sweat
most reviewers hated the sony mdras headphones that seemed to replace my model what a difference an s makes after reading other reviews i decided to try out these hoping that theyd be similar to my old sonys but without the folding partwell these headphones arent similar at all
in fact theyre not very good
the biggest problem i find with them is that they are way too flimsy
they dont stay aligned on my head
lean forward or move to the side and the headphone band moves forward and then the speaker moves around in your ear and the sound quality gets awful
if you need to use them when youre doing any kind of motion at all these are simply terrible
even when im on the elliptical machine they dont stay positioned very well
when i wipe the sweat off my brow that knocks it out of place half the timewhen they are situated exactly in the right spot the sound quality is decent but not nearly as good as the old mdras
so i only recommend them if youre going to be using them and being very stilli really like the feel of them but i found out after i got them that i really needed a great sound
if you dont mind having not so great bass and heavy sound then you would like these
light as a featherproscheapcons cord is short and annoying and likely wont last long these actually go over your head like ear muffs and the slightest bit of moisture bound to happen outside in south texas makes them slip out of your ear constantly require readjustment which distracts from your work out in my case running by the end of my workout they are typically around my neck because ive become frustrated i use these with a beat audio phone and all bass tones are distorted and i can hear a lot of background hissingsummarylook somewhere else if you want something good and cheap to work out with these may be a good backup if youre in a pinch and thats about itjust got these headphones figuring they would feel and sound like the sony walkman headsets of old but they do not
cheap feeling plastic thin sound no bass and strange wire exit from the speakers make the headset a sub par replica
they are not worth a penny more than  bucks
its not worth going through the hasstle of returning so ill just keep them as a backup
guess i have to deal with the modern earbud style to get decent sound quality
oh wellif you get a digital one with a remote you don t have to get up to push the button to switch devices
but it works well for the pricei had this for around  months  of the swithes is awful it never clicks into contactnow another one is getting badi am probably going to open it up and goto radioshack and have them help instal new swicthessadly i would not recommend this productthe seller i have no problems withthis head cleaner only has a minute of tape in it
most of the other ones have around five minutes
i ran it through a dirty camcorder as soon as i got it and it didnt help at all
im disappointed with the performance of this product
i have used panasonic tapes head cleaners for years and have always been satisfied until nowi bought these headphones less than a year ago
they were pretty comfortable for the most part
they were also a bit heavy but still comfortable
the sound quality was decent but after a year they stopped working for no reason
they had been well cared for and never used anywhere but in my home
and forget about trying to repair them
in my experience with aiwa their products just dont seem to hold up for long
very disappointingive had the s for about  weeks and so far its been quite disapointing
it has problems focusing in lowlight conditions leading to blurred pictures
i also purchased a noname  meg flash card that the camera refuses to recognize
though the other  or  cameras ive tried the card in all recognize it just fine
even using the supplied memory card often take  or  attempts turning the camera on and off before it recognizes itthis wasnt one of my better purchasesthe case for this is terrible the little snaps are extremely annoying and they tear out within a week
so after the case broke i was using this little strap they give you but using the strap broke off the corner by the battery case
i never dropped this or did anything that should have broken it
it is just really poorly madethat plus the fact that you have to use musicmatch makes me recommend not purchasing this device
musicmatch is a horrible programoh one more thing
you can only fit about  songs on this the way it comes so you have to cough up another  bucks for a memory card
its not a very good dealdont get this thinking that it will save your wristhands
it has no forwardback buttons so you end up moving the cursor around a lot more than with a regular mouse that has forwardback buttonsi own this trackball yet it was so limited that i put it away in favor of a mouse with lots of buttons
ive taken it out a couple of more times thinking that it must be worthwhile but it isnt  i spend too much time moving the mouse around just to go back in the browser or in windows explorer
the marble mouse trackball by logitech is much nicer than this trackman model
it has a different shape but has small forward and back buttons in addition to trackball and regular left and right mouse buttonsthe marble mouse is better for these reasons has forward and back buttons can be used both left and righthandedif your right hand is hurting consider trying the razer mice
ive tried a lot of different products looking for something easy on the hands and the razer lachesis is one that i found has these advantages has forwardback buttons can be used left or righthanded has a wheel like other good mice several other buttons which stay out of the way if not needed but can be programmed to do more than just forwardback has very slick pads so it moves very easily can be made to move far with very little movementthis is good if you have more than one large display
it can be put in lowresolution mode with a button press
 lightweightrequires less effort to move around
i havent written a razer review but probably should
i just saw this trackman in passing and just had to warn others
it gets pretty good reviews which led me to purchase it in the first place a couple of years back
if there were any reviews like this one i sure missed them
i havent tried everything yet so theres probably something even better than my current mouse or the marble mouse trackball
which reminds mei use the cordless optical trackman and use it daily on a mac
it works flawlessly on windows but jitters at higher acceleration settings on the mac
still ive found no better trackball because it is wireless has forwardback buttons essential has a couple of other programmable buttons has page updown buttons tiny and awkwardly placed has a scroll wheelnote the cordless optical trackman is only for righthanded use
if you havent discovered the timewristsaving forward back buttons do yourself a favor and get a device that has them
if youre expecting them steer clear of the logitech corded trackman wheel opticali have bough serveral of these mice
the are good mice with accurate movement and everything one could ask for 
 except once extremely important problem if the ball pops out of the socket the slightest impact against another object produces a small scratch or dent in the ball
i ask you 
even though a mouse is supposed to stay on a desk how many times does it fall to the floor buy accident
well with this mouse one time is enough to render it almost unusablethis small scratch or dent in the ball catches against the three plastic guides in the socket producing a small hitch to the movement to an incredibly annoying freeze of the ball moving anywheresmall as this may sound even one dent in the ball will catch dozens of times and hour if you move the ball a lot as in during game play or heavy editing of a textdespite the advantages i love in this type of mouse i will never buy it againi love trackballs and tried this one because my hand fit it well
but i found that i cannot get used to having the trackball under my thumb  its excruciatingly awkward
obviously ymmv  many reviewers here like itplus having used kensington trackballs for a long time i find that this ball is too small and does not roll as smoothly as im accustomed to
unfortunately kensingtons current main model has other problems which ive reviewed there
and the new logitech which has the ball in the right place only comes cordless which id rather not have to deal withedward i see the brevity of truthbeing a notebook computertoting student portability functionality and durability are three musts in any product i use
i initially purchased the trackman wheel optical to replace my logitech marble mouse which had been decomissioned because i played bounceebouncee with it too many times on the classroom linoleum floorwhen i first got the trackman wheel i was very impressed with the level of conformity to the shape of my hand bested later by another of logitechs products the mx see my review there
however two large problems began to present themselves during the first three weeks of service
the first is that after using the trackball for over  minutes my thumb would get increasingly twitchy and defeated the preciseness that is so touted by trackballs
it was almost as bad as the ball mouse i used with my  back in  remember those days
herkyjerky cursor or cursing
akimbothe second problem was with the scroll wheel
after the second week of using it i found the wheel slipping meaning i would roll it down one notch and the screen refused to scroll
this was much wasted effort on the part of my middle finger
no joke intended with these two problems i decided to get rid of my trackman wheel and replaced it with new logitech mice the optical mouse for notebooks for travel and the muchvaunted mx for home use
the trackball fetish was overi like the design and idea behind the mouse
unfortunately i feel like the track ball is a little too light as its lacking a solid weight to keep a steady mouse pointer
i have noticed this with several people using iti used the original until one day while cleaning it i lost one of the ball bearings
the original was awesome
sure it had to be cleaned from time to time but the ball spun easily the cord was long and most days it worked so flawlessly you just forgot about it
so since the original would catch without the ballbearing i decided it was time to get the newer optical versionughmy first one had dyslexia
up would go down and viceversa
logitech was nice enough in sending a replacement but after a few months this one catches almost worse than my original without the ball bearing
only the trackball doesnt come out so you cant manually clean it
very frustrating and im currently looking for a new solution
if this trackball will be your daily driver dont expect the legendary reliability of the previous models
this one will only disappointi dont like the way the right button works when i go to click to click on the left button my fingers click on both buttons its a physical reaction ive had a logitech trackball fx for years and loved it but i will pass on this one hope the grandson likes iti needed a mouse alternative
this item has a major flaw
the track ball is slippery and to light
i lack a lot of precision that i would get with track ball with a grip coating
i need to press hard on the ball to get it working and the motion is not fluid
i do not like this itemwish i had another of the earlier model  this one is a pain to usemy biggest complaint is my middle finger keeps inadvertently pressing the right keyi like moving the ball with my index finger and the earlier model had a smaller ballthis review is for a trackball not a mouse with a balli have been using a trackball for years because computers are easier to manage when my hand does not have to move a mouse around and the trackball can be manipulated fixed in place without a mouse pad i might add
unfortunately there are fewer and fewer real trackballs available
the mice made with a ball are not really the same as a trackballmy new computer does not have a ps port and my trackman marble fx does not have a usb connector
so i bought a new trackball with the usb interface and here is my experience with logitechs trackman wheel opticalfor years as a righthanded user i have been using their trackman marble fx where the ball is placed for use by the right index finger
this arrangement it far superior to a ball thats placed for use by the thumb as is the case with this trackman wheel optical
the thumb is needed for clicking the left button not for moving the ballapparently i am not the only complainer about this change
my trackman marble fx is not made any more and i have seen used ones offered for no less than  dollars
i wish logitech would reconsider their marketing strategy and reissue the very good trackman marble fx in a usb version in its original  dollar range maybe even wirelessi decided to try a trackball because my right arm has a slight pain after extended use of a laptop
i decide to try this one because its good reviews and low price
after one nights use i decided to return it because of two problems
it is not really ergonomic
the thumb is good at sweeping the ball in a left to right motion but it is very tiresome to move the ball in a updown motion
i found that i need to move the thumb too many times in order to move the cursor downward cross the screen
i cant add too much acceleration because the control is already imprecise without any acceleration
yes some reviewer said you can spin the ball if you want to move quickly but i found that i have to jerk my thumb in order to give the ball some momentum
i noticed how much tension is on the tendons and muscles of the thumb
also the fingers end is too curved so the fingers need to work harder to push or hold the buttons
it puts quite some strain on both the index finger and the thumb if you want to drag something in a downward motion
the ball is very imprecise to control
the bearings are not rollers so what they put on the ball is not rolling resistance
there is quite some friction
this makes the ball hitch
it is very difficult to move the cursor in small distances even if you use the index finger instead of the thumb
it does this even when it is new
this is a major problem in my perspective as a normal user
for example i found it very hard to select text in a browser if the selection starts with a narrow letter like i and is at the beginning of a line because you only have two or three pixels to miss
it will be more tricky if you do graphic design i believeafter using it for one night i found that i like the touchpad on my laptop much better
im going to return itdo you really want to buy it  its a  to pin connectori bought it by mistake for my handycam and later found out that i need a  to  pin connectori just dont get this lens
about  of the photos are great without changing scene or settings
also when i purchased this there was a rebate available from tamron
i sent in the required form serial number etc
i received a letter back stating this lens was not eligible for a manufacturer rebate because the sn indicated it is a gray market lens
let the buyer bewarei bought these cds a lot of time ago and i remember that i lost  cds because of problems in the burning process  of cds was lostthe quality of this cds is not very good
the upside surface is very vulnerable and you can even scratch it easily only by touching at it
you can easily remove the surface completely
the result is going to be an unusable transparent cdmany of these discs are right now a waste because of the problems with the surface and hardly will buy cds from this manufacturer again
though i understand its a good priceplease be aware of the qualitymy brother got this for his earthlink dsl
it never quite worked right
both of us took a look at it
the connection would work for a few minutes and then disconnect
to reconnect you had to go through the setup again
this was quite annoying for general web browsing
however it just wont work with internet gamingi had an older linksys router wo wireless and swapped with him
the netgear works fine with my broadband service sbc yahoo
i can vpn to work without any problems
the wireless works fine tooas for my brothers earthlink connection the linksys router is as steady as a rocki gave it  stars instead of  because it does seem happy with my sbc yahoo
connection
if given a choice id stick with linksysi have been thrilled to have an mp player and this one did the job  for a few months
yes it went through batteries every  hours but i got some nimh rechargables and was not too unhappy to change them
i bought a radio shack power adapter but it would not work right with it
too finicky
and it seems to have no skip protection for mp
i used it in my car but on bumpy highways it would not worknow it is  months old and has suddenly failed
it keeps saying quotno discquot no matter what disc i use
i went to the sonicblue site and found this problem in the frequently asked questions so i know its a common problem
i tried to find out about repair but that part of the site is missing
so i now must buy another player and toss this onesome people may have had better luck but i think that it would be a big risk to buy from this company or any future version of themi love the lookprecision feel of the wireless intellimouse explorer but am returning mine today even though im not totally happy with this decisionas with many others ive experienced a very annoying quirk caused by the power saving features that microsoft built into the product when resting your hand on the mouse with no activity for  seconds or so the next time you attempt to move the pointer there will be a brief lag before the mouse begins to respond
im finding this somewhat frustrating when working with a wave file editing programworse still a problem has surfaced for which i cannot find the answerand this is the main reason its being returned
sporadically when using windows xp the mouse buttons will stop responding completely for  seconds
movement of the cursor is still possible but attempting to leftclick upon objects produces no actionmicrosofts knowledge base acknowledges the issue but blames it on leftover installation filesregistry entries from a prior mouse installationthey do provide a lengthy procedure for correcting the condition
unfortunately that cant be the root of the problem in this case
several days ago when nothing else would work i reloaded windows xp from scratch
it readily recognizedinstalled basic software drivers for the wireless intellimouse so it was up and running immediately
sadly the condition still remains and is so sporadic that i havent a clue as to the causethis a sad return for mei like the product overall
freedom from a cord is welcome and the mouse has a hefty precision feel that i find pleasingmicrosoft im not writing this technology off completely and will be waiting anxiously for a second generation product
if and when it arrives ill quickly line up to purchase one
for now ill go back to my corded intellimouse explorertoo heavy
consumes lots of power
shape is not comfortable
the pain of moving a brick across my mouse pad outweights the benefit of freedom from the connecting wirei love the shape of the mouse and the fact that its wireless
but
the moment i started to use it i noticed the sluggishness with this mouse
too bad i was going to fall in love with this mouse but i cant stand the sluggishness as i do heavy work with computers
i do programming so i need real quick response like wired intelli mouse explorer
im going to back to it right nowwith both the logitech and microsoft side by side i find myself switching between the two to protect my wrists
this mouse works but not for detail work
heres why  its heavy
 its stickymicrosoft uses cheaper slidepads compared to logitech   the stickiness makes it nearly impossible to nudge over a pixel   it is slow to wake up from its snooze state which it enters very very quickly and typically jumps  pixels when it does wake upon the good side   its bigger and fits in my large hands better than the logitech devices
 the batteries appear to last a little longeri use my computer mouse constantly d design work and find it frustrating to use this mouse for fine positioning
i would never purchase it again
i only gave it  stars because it meets its specsi guess im a gluten for punishment but this is the nd of these that ive gone through now
it couldnt be designed to fit your hand any better at least mine but the problems are in the electronics on the inside
its hard to wake up sticks to everything but the most glossy smooth surfaces and seems to go through batterys like a digital camera
the problem is with the batterys maybe this is just rechargables but on both units with just normal use the batterys have exploded inside the mouse and ruined the electronics inside
the second time i was using the mouse when it popped and fryed itselfi dont recommend this mouse as much as i love how it fits my handit needs to work longer than a few months especially for the pricethink about the following before buyingif you read all the nice reviews here about this mouse youll find that most of them have some sort of issue with the mouse the battery life is short recharging cradle would be nice the mouse makes noise return from powersaving mode is sluggishto me the last item makes the mouse nearly unusable
often ill be reading an article and try to scroll after a few seconds but the mouse will not do anything for more than a second
additionally the mouse senses if you have your hand quotin placequot before powering up so if you ever move the mouse with just a finger or two sure its not often but it happens it will not work because it doesnt power upupdated info ive been in contact with microsoft support
the customer service representative was very thorough in trying to remedy the delay in powering up
however the final answer i get is quotupon further research i have infact found what you are experiencing is a feature of the wireless explorer
this is by design to extend the battery lifequotone persons feature is anothers bugheres the reasons why i call this a cheap plastic junk
the  mp doesnt give enough picture quality
mp is just a marketing thing its actual quality is more like mp
visible purple fringing chromatic aberrations
lcd monitor is not good tough to see anything on in sunlight
using a cheapish lcd helps drive profit margins higher for kodak on this
unacceptable time lag when veiewing on lcd
takes more than  secs to write anything on the cf card
even my last years camera was much better than this 
poor viewing capabilites
you need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock
why doesnt kodak sell it along with camera itself 
after all it hardly worth  bucks 
missing features like movieaudio video out atleast some manual controls etci have compared this camera to other canonsony ones and find this way below on qualityfeatures compared to them
i see that many people here have a  star review for this but then maybe its their first experience with a digicamkodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras
buy a canon s or s or a and you will be much more happy
they have much more features and have very good metallic bodies
dont buy this plastic junk
look all the freebies that kodak is throwing in to sell this i know i will not be very pouplar in my harsh review about this cheapie but i prefer to be candidbought this from local store based on the low price
what a disappointment
the remote is terrible
very poorly designed and after few months remote stopped working
too bad there was no manufacturers code available to use universal remote
ocassionally cd tray doesnt openpicture quality was okoverall very frustating
never buy daewoo againi have the same problem list the other user
the ma always stop working after i restarted the computer
i have to reinstall the driver and reboot several times before it works again
the problem occurs almost every time i shutdown the pc
i installed the new driver from their website but still didnt help either
its very frustrating
i rather go back to my wire network
i cant recommend this productthe good  it installs easily enough and ive always had excellent signal strength with itthe bad  if youre using windows xp and want to do anything but browse the internet return this adapter immediately
it is not compatible with the wireless zero config service in xp
every  seconds it drops the connection and reconnects in about  seconds
so this adapter is fairly useless for online games streaming mps from another pc on the network ssh connections or anything else that requires constant connectionsthe ugly  it seems as if netgear has completely abandoned this product
the software download page makes you guess which driver is the right one and it hasnt been updated in forever  maybe theres just not a way to fix itmy verdict  if you just want to browse the web and you can pick one up cheap go for it
but with linksys adapters selling for the same price i cant see why you wouldwhat are bad player even exp is better than it
stupid antishock alway skipping while walking  no problem on sp casio pz and tdk mojo
ok skipping annoying it skips wonderfully will do mix songs when i llisten to dance music while walking it will mix up another track music into my ear
preload the wrong track for antiskip
oh my god willie nelson sings a song with mcdonna sometimes chinese singer sing with lee ann this player done a good job i have never think they have a song togetherno good with no navigation screenwhats good batteries life sound quality when you non activitely
riovolt sp sp with no good sounding
didnt try sp and spwasted my im not saying this is really a bad quotpocket managerquot  but i would not purchase it if you want any other programs than the ones that came with it
why do i say this
beacuse it really isnt a windows ce machine its based on windows ce
the color screen is the good the best in its class
i dont like quottrashingquot items but i i have to warn you not to buy this unless you just need it for buissnes or school
the color screen has a slow responce is blurry and the the dark colors look fuzzy
it is thick about an inch thick does not have any type of linking capibilities no beam option but you dont need one theres nothing to beam
also video files have to be in cmf format casio movie format and they dont have incoders to turn video diels into the cmf format the only movies you can see are the ones at the casio website
i still have yet to find out how to put mps on it
if you think your slick and you think you go to windows media player then click transfer to device your wrong
its not a windows ce device so it doenst work
installing the hotsyncing tool was a hassle even though i am very good with that type of thing complex to use no help files
also it has a cheep feel to it like if you squezed it it would break
also the majority of the people i know have palm os based machines hell they all do even i do my friend got this he thought he was cool cuase he had color now he feels left out  of us have palms vs sony clies and even one has a palm iii and he cant send to us or play games 
even though there clock speed is slower     mhz while pocket pcs have processors that are  times faster they feel slower they are not as efficent as the palms
palms look more profesinal are not so exspenive and have thousands of programs for them
you can send stuff to each other and expand them
oh yeah this machine has a compact flash port thats a plus
excuse me for quothotwateringquot this product
the final vertict do not buy this machine unless you will never need to expand itps
if you want it for the mp player get a real mp player like a nomad or a mindisk playerthis is a pocket organizer based on ce softwarewhat does that meanit cannot use  of the existing pocketpc software
casio is promoting products to compile versions to work with the be but currently there is virtually nothingthe pictures are excellent
in fact they are among the best for mega digicams
this is where the virtues of this camera end
the  uses an sd or mmc card that is hard to find
once you find them in some retail stores they cost  times more than their cf counterparts
sd or mmc are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization yet this camera is bigger than kodak  an excellent camera that uses cf card
therefore this card format doesnt make any sense
another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the sd card is  mb as compared with  mb for cf card
since the internal memory allows me only about  pictures at the highest resolution i tried to order a  mb sd card  the price in retail stores costs up to  times more
now i have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever i go
the purchase turned out to be a disasteri am new to digital photography and was wary of spending much for my first camara
once i had a reasonably inexpensive digital camara for a while i would know what features were useful for my next camara and hopefully the future camara prices would fall to a reasonable level
the dx seemed to fit my requirements for a first digital camara
it had a  megapixal resolution was relatively inexpensive had received reasonable reviews for its picture quality and was designed for a novice digital photographer
after playing with it for a while i am somewhat disappointed
first the features are more limited than i expected
in particular there is no self timer feature
second the picture quality is what i consider mediocre
third the picture storage uses mmcsd cards
these cards are not all that popular yet and much more difficult to find
this of course means the price is much higher for than for the more popular compact flash and smartmedia cards
as a matter of fact the price is roughly  higher
after some research at the kodak web site only two of their camaras use mmcsd
most use compact flash
in summarypros easy camara for the novice
relatively inexpensivecons very limited features
mediocre picture quality
uses expensive mmcsd which are more difficult to findconclusionif i had known about the cons up front i would have looked fora different camarai used this lexar memory stick more few years
however recently i trieda used sony memory stick from my friend then i notice this one is veryslow during down loading my pictures
i guess i learned not to get aftermarket productsbeautiful picture quality and great features  too bad i cant recommend it due to lousy reliability and worse service policies
the first laser failed about  months after i bought the unit
i replaced it for about  and that laser failed in  months
panasonic doesnt seem to have many if any dealers or spare parts  so your only recourse is depot repair which is slow expensive and unreliablelove the picture but this thing is just too fragile and not worth the hassle  avoidi have owned this camera for several years now i bought it when digital cameras were still pricey paid about  i have been shopping for a new camera and have decided to buy the kodak zthis was my first digital camera the reviews at the time i bought it were very good for the money but that was then and this is now and now you can get more camera for your moneythis camera has one major flaw you need to be aware of the battery door i dont know if fuji has fixed the issue on newer versions of this or not but alot of the reviews i read when i bought mine mentioned this the door pops open very easy if you happen to bump it and out comes your batterys on the ground if you get one open the door and carefully bend the metal tab latch out a little this seems to help hold a bit betteralso a smaller flaw is the slideing lens cover door it has to clicked all the way open for the camera to workas far as pictures it took pretty good pictures at first but over time the image quality dosent seem as good as it wasthis is a very basic camera with very basic features easy to operategiven the current price and features of digital cameras i think i would look elsewhereaudigy platinum sounds wonderful
having the controls in the front is the obvious selling point especially when you consider you get a free front  port but  i leave mine on mute at all times unless i want to hear something specific
the reason is that every time you reboot the volume defaults to the loudest setting waking everyone in the house
creative has no fix only a quotwork aroundquot that doesnt work
it is a pain to pay this much for a sound card and have to leave it off
stick with what you have until they have a real fixcons flimsy
i am amazed at how poorly the legs are attached to this rack
the slightest pressure will cause the leg stands to pop off and they have no threads to secure them back onpros holds a lot of dvdsthis item should sell for at least half of what they are selling it forsome of the shelves were bent the wire parts on some shelves were not attached welded at the endsthe adjustable feet were crooked and not even square
i tried to straighten them by hand but they started to make acracking noise so i quitwhen i got it all assembled i spent over  minutes trying to get everything straight and square and it still looks terriblethe only reason i gave it  stars was because it was easy to assemblethats my review
its wobbly
it needs cross braces
the shorter ones are probably okit does assemble easily
wobblynote i bought this very  rack of this very site for way less money and free shippingwhy didnt i notice this when i bought it
those little round pad feet are not able to stabilize this media rack
thankfully im using this for vhs storage while i go through and either digitize them or throw them outoh yes this will go on a carpeted floor
perhaps better stability on a hardwood floor ill betthe rack comes with a part that is supposed to be used to anchor it to the wall by drilling a hole in the wallboard
what if i dont want to drill a hole in my wallboard every time i move this thing
is creating and including that part really so much easier than making the bottom of the legs wide enough to provide genuine stability
i would not recommend this rack if you have little ones who like to climb on things
perhaps if youare a handyman you can create a stable base yourself but isnt the reason why people like us buy products like this is because we are not handy
im so thankful that this was cheap useable and can find a second life later maybe as a shoe rack or some other kind of thing holdermy experience with this camera is similar to the professional review atthis camera was the cheapest  mega pixel at the time
 i was disappointed that it did not come with a power adapter like the previous model hp i must say i think the picture quality was better on my  also the  has some serious focusing problems
i read about them at other review sites but ordered the camera anyway
i took a trip to the caribbean and brought the camera with me
on two mb cf cards i could take  pictures
with the rechargeable batteries i never once ran out of juice while shooting
in all i took  pictures  of which were blurry or out of focus and did not appear that way on the preview screenof couse that still left me with over  clear and focused pictures but i think that ratio is unacceptablei cannot recommend this camera
low light shots are horrible
the more light you have the better your picture will be
this camera does not compensate as good as other digital cameras in low light situations including the older and cheaper  modelwhile it works the range on this radio is horrendous
on offroading excursions i must stay well within an eight of a mile to communicate with any other vehicle
it might suffice as a handheld radio while on foot but unless youre directing traffic in a truckyard i cant imagine many scenarios where the limited range of this radio would meet your requirementsto further confirm we tested this radio in a huge open field
in optimal conditions i was able to just barely communicate with another vehicle about a quarter mile away if i was leaning out the window of mine
doing so required many repeats and struggling to hear through crackles and static but it was at least somewhat doable
comfortably sitting in my seat nothing but staticdecent quality and generally user friendly
but it does not have noaa weather channels as stated in the editorial description
it only has the standard  cb channels
the range is limited but in general what i expected from a handheld cb
most of them have limited range
my main reason for buying was the noaa channels and the ability to monitor cb from my house near the nys thruway and when traveling
im returning due to the lack of noaa as statedthe part that goes into the ear is entriely too large hat it wont stay in my ear securely
ear piece is too bigyou have to speak directly at the micro at less than  centimeters of distance if you want use this microphonethat or use some kind of amplificatorthe e is an improved model over last years e only  megapixels but the seriouss flaw of the very slow writespeeds to card from its memory buffer is a major drawback
some people would argue that its not too bad due but if you need somethign quick once in a while this is not the camera to get
for instance press photographers and photojournalists who need to fire off  shots in rapid succession will be very frustrated by this camera
even parents who want take shots of their child as she runs about will be annoyed at constantly waiting for the camera to write and will miss many shotson the positive side the lens f  f x with a mechanically linked zoom ring  megapixels of resolution a professional locked control system a wide variety of manual control and a robust metal casebut all those positives are knocked out by the slow write speed
skip this camerai really liked the keyboard but the mouse didnt feel quite right
it felt too small in my hands and it was hard to control
the pointer seemed to lag as well
i found it hard to navigate with this mouse in most first person shooters
another thing i hated about the mouse is that its always on even when the computers offive used this item both before and after the ipod
its a nice product
it seems somewhat well made
as one of the first hard drivebased players its not fair to judge it against newer products so here are some issues that creative should have gotten right but failed tofirst the ui is very very slow when used while playing a song
the menus are otherwise easy to navigate
it seems like the same processor is being used to decode the mp music and to run the ui  and that processor isnt up to the tasksecond the ui has some minor glitches that keep it from being as smooth as id like
its designed well for someone that has time to think but a player that will be used in the car or while running or working shouldnt assume it will have the users attentioncreative playcenter is actually decent software
not great mind you but decent
it would be nice if the software were downloadable from creatives site  ive never found it
it would also be nice if i could get some sort of drive letter access to the drive for data storageother applications work with the nomad jukebox
ive used windows media player on windows and itunes on the mac
realplayer is supposed to support it as well but ive not tried it
none of the third party applications ive used seem to support data and transfering music from the player to the computer
for that you must use the creative playcenter applicationi recently purchased an ipaq  and have been very dissappointed by compaqs inability to release a product that works as advertisedone of the main reasons for buying this unit is because of the sd secure digital card expansion slot
i needed it to store data and to also take my mps on the road when i traveled
i called compaqs presales number and spoke to a representative
i told them what i needed this for and they assured me it would work as advertisedafter puchasing the unit and accesories  i immediately found problems with playing mps from the sd card
part of the song would play and it would then quit completely or cycle through to the next song only to exhibit the same problem
after speaking with a technical support rep from the sd cards maker sandisk they thought it could be a corrupted sd card
they sent me another one only to find the problem still existed
after several emails tofrom compaq tech support they told me it was a known issue and they are working on it with no timeline given for a fixin my opinion there is no excuse for releasing a product that has not been throughly tested to perform as advertised
once again the users have become the beta testersnow because of the way it handles music files i cannot and will not trust the sd expansion slot to store any critical data for fear it will become corrupted
this is a serious flaw and compaqs noncaring attitude just worsens the case for purchasing a product like thisi was testing this for my company and have recommended they either consider another product or wait until compaq resolves these issueson the plus side i will say as a basic pda it performs fine
it has a nice display and thankfully i did not get one with backlight problems as some users have reported
the accessories work well and it is nicely intergrated with outlook
but these bells and whistles come at a premium price and my old handspring visor functioned as a good pda for this type of use at only a fraction of the costi am giving it only  stars because basically compaq doesnt have their act together
the presales answers are not reliable because obviously they are not communicating with their tech support staff and are unaware of problems
they are probably just reading information off the sales brochuresfor anyone considering purchasing a  series i would go to the compaq support forum and look at the problems that other people have experienced and then wait for compaq to resolve these issuesthis gizmo doesnt fit the hot shoe mount
you have to slide it in on one side where it hangs on precariously while you adjust the tripod
it is functional but you get what pay fori recently bought a lynksys wireless pci adapter wmp for my daughters dell computer
i installed the card and software per directions
each time i restart the computer i have to manually connect to my wireless router
i called  hour technical support center located in india
i had to ask the person to repeat themselves several times because of their strong dialect
the individual had to ask me to hold on several times while they searched for a solution
after about  minutes to an hour of following his directions i am no better off and in fact i am having more of a problem connecting to the router than i did before i made the call
linksys has a great name in network products but before i make my next purchase i will research companies that have us based help centeri had a chance to test this set along with yamaha ystm in store imo i prefer yamaha y because the overall audio y is very good deep with no boomy bass and my happy past experience i had with y pieces seton the other side when i test this set i dont believe this is altec lansing
what the hell happened
mid and treble are okay the problem is bass it is hard to adjust and boomy its over emphasized around hz but very weak around hzone more thing i am surprised is my exroommate purchased the set he may like this but i am sure i dont like it at all its not natural as past althis is the rd nikon digital camera ive had and returned thanks amazoni had the and the for meand this is a personal observationtheyre too damn small
i have poor eyesight and the screen and menus are too small for me to navigatesureyou could set it up for idiot proof but why spend  for a totally adjustable camera
i did try a few pictures and they seemed fine but once again i didnt take the time to really use the featuresi couldntim not sold on digital photography for my purposesyou could buy an excellent mm camera for  the cost of the  and buy a  scanner and do the same thingive used nikon equipment for  years and love themits too bad that these cameras dont work for memaybe they will for yougo look at them before buying and make sure they are what you want and needthe first ones i owned the flimsy cord broke
the second ones i bought lasted awhile but then they broke in half
the third ones i owned they had bad no sound on the left side
the were comfortable and i liked the second pair because it had awesome sound quality
though the durability of these are a big problem which means i will not be buying them againi bought this hoping id be able to watch and record tv
this card has several bugs
one the tv listings are not accurate and i found myslef using yahoo tv listings because they were always correct and i didnt want to miss any shows
the recording part was easy and the video looked ok but not great
however once in a while the  audio pops and the video skips
moreover when im watching tv the audio frequently goes out of sync with the audio
i did a google search and found many other people had the same problem
i updated all of the drivers and changed the sound card and nothing worked
strangely if the audio is out of sync and i press the record button all recorded video is insync
anyway dont buy it
get something more expesive and save yourself a hasslethis product has some great claims
i was really excited to get it in the mail
but after trying it out on  separate computers including one that was brand new with all new drivers and a fresh load of xp the bottom line is that this ati tv wonder ve is a piece of junkthe main problem involves frequent lockups while in capture mode
this happened on both machines
it doesnt recognize that directx  is installed it doesnt recognize its own capture drivers from the ati site yes i checked to make sure i was loading the right drivers that go with this card
normally im a fan of atis stuff  and some of their display adapters have been great
but as for the tv wonder ve  i recommend that you pass it up and buy from another vendor
it will save you a lot of headachepros good sound
large lcd display
host of useful featurescons poor durability
bulky
uncomfortable buttonsthis player lasted me seven days
i was pretty happy with it until it started displaying no disk with any cdr audio or mp
looks like a very unreliable less expensive piece of plastic stuffed with expensive electronicsif youre willing to gamble and go through the returnexchange wait this may be the best unit out there  if it doesnt break down within a weekmonth that isi too have bought a couple of these players and am taking the second back to best buy today
the first one quit working after about a year and i bought a lesser model the second time and have only used it a month before it too stopped working
they were featurerich players at first with little competition which i think led sonic to be a little lax in their customer service and quality
right now ive decided to hold off another purchase until i see some long term customer reviews of the iriver playerhad  of these hooked to  ch sacd one channel failed took a long time to find bad cable most frustrating thing ever av wise only cable to ever fail on me not attached to mini jack so save box recipthave owned these for a year now
i would not recommend them
i have these at home for my pc
everything seems to add interference
its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones
some days just turning your head a few inchs when i am a feet from the unit is enough for them to loose signal
i dont bother to charge them on the stand i rotate batteries between a charger and the headphones
at work i have had  pairs of sennheiser headphones
in  i bought the rs
they worked great but i broke them by standing on them
now i have refurbished rss that work excellently and they run in rechargable aaas
neither senns really have the surround sound but i cant tell the difference to be honest
the surround sound on these is not that decernable
i think reception quality trumps surround dound in the end
i would get the rssthe sound quality is reasonably good with great sounding bass
if this was a wired headphone i would give it  or maybe  stars
this product is not ready for wireless
when it does work it sounds great but you cannot get  minute of continuous play without it hissing or cutting out even at ft range
beyond  ft its useless
incidentally people buy this product for its wireless feature which doesnt work and thats why i give it  stars
if ar had had stick to wired  sell it at half the price they would make a bundle
it simple means that not enough testing was done before they release it to the public
if ar can solve its wireless problems this would be a superb producti bought these yesterday and returned them today
no matter where i put them i had static and a definate whine in the background
the static i could have handled
the whine though was just to much to tolerate for a  product
i was going to use these for movies and i must say the actual sound is better than my sennheisser rss
i really would have liked to have kept them but that high pitched whine in the background was just to muchsound quality ok  no way  feet more like   who ever engineered control switches must of hated home electronic fans
switches are small and illogical
almost impossible to control by feelafter a few months of use you will be able to control volume and onoff without removing from your head to take a look just moronicplastic on both sides have broken and been fixed with super glueno other way to do at all as pieces are so minute
super glue fails and must do again and of course once glued the pivoting feature for ear comfort no longer works as it is gluedi think these engineers should go out and see what we chickens are eating out here before they foist their imaginative experiments on usanyhing else you wish to knowi received this tv about an hour ago unpacked it and hooked it up
the picture was ok for what i needed it for as a matter of fact it is a good picture
i am using it as a monitor for a surveillance camera at the gate to the houseas i watch it i noticed that the company name was upsidedown and that the tuning bar was too
but the lcd was rightsideup in the cabinet
the quality control guy must have been zonked
mikewhile jvc seems to offer the only real choice right now in dvhs recording the mitsubishi dvhs vcrs are not compatible with dtheater tapes this is definitely on the quotbleeding edgequothdtv recording can only be performed from an incoming ilink firewire connection
there is a single hdtv component output but no hdtv component inputon the plus side jvc includes dvgtmpeg transcoder circuitry allowing you to connect a dv camcorder and record on mpeg although im still not sure why you wouldnt leave it in its native smaller tape dvin my case the jvc properly registered on my mitsubishi hdtv with homelink but not as a recordable device
so no way to record  only playbackas a regular svhs vcr you can find much better for a fraction of the cost
cable box control only goes up to channel  so not much use in the digital cable markets
there is no ability to control input audio levelunless you absolutely need dtheater playback or you know this will work with your hdtv then save your money and wait for the technology to solidifyi wanted a macro lens that would also be good for portraitssnapshots and this just wasnt it for me
i found as others have said that this lens has issues with the autofocus and the shots i took just werent that sharp even at f and above
i love the olympus zuiko mm macro but the focal length was just too high for what i want to use it for but boy was it sharp
this lens is also very heavy even heavier than the zuiko mm macro
i would really love to see olympus come out with a fast prime think the canon mm f macro or not for the eseries cameras
ill stick with my  f for nowi wanted to like this lens because i always prefer lenses with a close focusing distance and this is a rare macro mm not a true macro but it focuses very close
unfortunately i was never satisfied with the image quality of the photos
the lens is mush wide open and it never gets really sharp across the board even when stopped down
the bokeh has an ugly swirly quality that makes the background of closeups unpleasant looking
it might be ok for landscape shots of mountains etc
when used close to infinity and stopped way down but then whats the point of having a fast macro lens if you cant use it at the wide apertures and minimum focus distancei used it on a full frame camera but it would make a good normal focal length lens on a crop sensor camera if the optics were better
instead i would opt for the sigma mm f lens which is actually usable wide open
sigma has some great lenses but this isnt one of them
unlike another reviewer i found the build quality and autofocus performance to be just fine but the optics to be subpar others have found the oppositeif you are going to buy only one wide angle lens make it thezeiss mm f distagon t ze series lens for canon eos digital slr camerasyes it costs a small fortune but its worth every penny
sell some other lenses if you have to the zeiss  can replace all of your wide angle lenses its so goodeven if you need to crop them a bit to a  or mm field of view
there is something very special and even magical about the zeiss  that has to be experienced it makes you not want to use any other wide angle lens once youve tried iti am a working professional who uses my camera and lens on a daily basis and unlike most who only care about the optics everything else matters to me and im going to explain to you why im rating it only  out of  in detailsthe mm f is a niche lens
most people who shoot this wide never even need a large aperture to begin with
event photographers dont shoot this wide very often average photography enthusiasts would be better off with a ultra wide zoom lens instead of a prime and landscape photographers who might treasure this the most often times prefers more in focus and thus rarely use large aperture like this on a wide
i shoot weddings and every now and then i do rely on niche lens to create special images
and thats where this lens really shines
this lens is sharp and actually much sharper than i expected even at f where its supposed to be soft it performs really well
the only complain in terms of optics is that the color is a little cool and feels a little off comparing to every other nikkor glass i ownusing this lens under welllit scenarios is generally a pleasure
the very shallow depth of field at f along with the macro capabilities of this lens will allow you to do a lot of things you wouldnt be able to do with a regular bag of lens
even comparing to my nikon mm f this lens have a special place cause you can really still use the shallow depth of field to identify your subject shooting so wide whereas the  at f is probably at best good for lowlight purposes
distortion of this lens is very well controlled as well which is a pleasant surprise to find on a mm wide angle lensunfortunately this is where the praises end
below are my major complaints focusing mechanism is awful
i current own more than a dozen nikon glass and this is the nd sigma lens i own
unfortunately they both behave similarly when they focus it starts focusing from one end to the other and if it cannot lock in the focus on the first try it goes all the way back and stop
i know its hard to understand but in comparison a nikon lens would also start focusing from one end to the other but somewhere along the line it has an idea where to lock in the focus and it tries hard to stop there and if it misses the first time it will go back and forth around that focus distance and try to lock in without having to go all the way from one end to another again
focus accuracy is way low its simply unreliable
unless youre focusing on something with a clear edge or something contrasty and easily identifiable the lens falls way short
this becomes more apparent when youre trying to shoot against the light and try to autofocus  typically i can get about  successful rate on a d with a  fg or a mm f but on a sigma it will probably lock in about  of the time and half the time its actually wrong even when it locks in
focusing speed is way slow but that probably has something to do with the macro capabilities
construction  generally speaking the lens construction is pretty good but just like the sigma mm f macro the lens barrel rolls in and out when you focus
this isnt as serious as the mm but then the lens hood is attached to the inner barrel which doesnt exactly protect the lens very wellthat being said will i still keep my lensthe short answer is yes i willthere really isnt a much better option there at this price point unless nikon makes a full frame fast and wide prime at f below 
i have a hard time justifying spending about k for a lens that i dont use more often or wont find a permanent spot in my cameralens case
will it work for you
ymmv
it depends on what you do with it and how you use iti now have bought two lenses that were not designed for the smaller digital camera sensor and both consistently fail to autofocus the sigma mm and the canon mm f ii both relatively inexpensive lenses and both designed for film cameras i believe
i was able to get both to focus most of the time by using my live view focusing but it is slow and you cant use the viewfinder
i just couldnt justify keeping this large heavy no doubt very high quality lens if it was going to be that difficult to usethe kit lens that came with my canon xsi focuses much more reliably maybe because that lens is designed for small sensor cameraswell it does not auto focus on nikon d even though the manual say it does
it is very hard to focus this lens manually
the resulting picture always come out somewhat fuzzy and color is weird
no regular filters would work on it
if you have nikon d the stock lens work much better then this one
i would not recommend this to a friendso first let me get this out of the way these speakers sound great
the bass is powerful and punchy while the small and very attractive speakers deliver a crisp high end
midrange does suffer a bit in larger spaces but probably only to the very discerning listener
i replaced my clunky yamaha ystms system with this one and as far as the sound goes i find the s to be very comparableok so why give it  stars
well it has everything to do with the design of these things
altec lansing has successfully taken a potentially great product and ruined it with terrible controls
the remote in my opinion is completely useless
it features a power button and two volume buttons
now assuming you have the speakers plugged into the same outlet strip as your computer most users will shut the speaker system down with the computer system
this makes sense to me
the problem is that whenever you bring power back to the system you must manually turn on the power button on the remote and readjust the volume to a normal level
the default for this system is for it to be off and at very low volume
the only workaround to this is to keep the speakers powered on all the time
but this to me makes very little sense
when i turn my computer on i expect to hear sound
well you dont with the smy second gripe has to do with the fact that this system has no headphone jack
this is a major inconvenience when using the computer late at nightmy third gripe has to do with the fact that you have no idea what volume you are listening to
the remote as i said features two volume buttons but with no visual display telling you where you are at
this just goes against my natural tendency to want to know what volume i am listening to relative to the systems capabilitiesmy last gripe has to do with the design of the speakers
i have no complaint with the subwoofer as it is very slim compact and well protected
however the satellites have fully exposed speaker cones that are barely protected by only a thin vertical strip of metal
i had to move these speakers well above earlevel in order to keep them away from the stray hands of my young childso overall the system is great sounding attractive and completely userunfriendly
just not enough in my opinionits not so much that these are low quality speakersthe sats have survived many drop tests
and theyre actually pretty loud
the problem lies in the use of multiple small drivers in the sats rather than a way highmid configuration
also the subwoofer while powerful has horrible clarity
the result is lacking midrange and muddy bassacceptable for games but certainly not for musicalso the quot inputs kept giving me trouble
theyd come loose at random
i suspect they were defective
in any case i replaced them with quot jacks
problem solvedif youre a gamer dont plan to listen to music and you can find a really good deal on these they might be an okay choice
i got mine free and given that im happy enough with them
but theyre certainly not worth the retail price
do yourself a favor and buy some quality speakers from klipsch or telexthis was a replacement for one of my speakers
while removing and replacing i tightened the screw that holds the speakers at a set angle and it shattered from metal fatigue
i love my bose system and had to replace this bracket but youd think it would be made of a higher quality andor better designthis is so like a bose design
they match the silly little tiny speakers and lack the adjustment  that some installations need
so like i have always said the letters bose
stand for better off somewhere else this is the only sony handheld at present  that can connect to a cellular modem and its a shame
the screen is horrible
the color ones such as the clie  are great but theres no wireless modems to go with themi bought this because my car stereo is old enough that it only has a radio a cassette player and a single cd player
i wanted to listen to my own music but i was getting tired of burning cds and cassettes would be even worse so i decided to try one of these which id use with my iphone or tablet
this adapter works fairly well except that in my car it clicks
constantly
click click click over and over and over
it gets annoying
its loud too
i can turn up the volume enough to cover it up but that can be way too loud  i have nothing against loud music but i do like my hearingim told that this is a pretty common problem with all adapters like this however  its the autoreverse mechanism kicking in since because the tape doesnt move it thinks its stopped
ive found a potential fix online and will have to try it but until then this thing is only worth  stars to me
at mostedit couldnt figure out a way to fix itedit after about  months of use despite the clicking the cord snapped upon being pulled by accident so its pretty weak
ive decided to try another brand
apparently from what ive read your mileage with one of these may vary
its pretty randomi have an older sony cassette adapter that came w a discman bundle from around   this worked great but now the cable connection at the jack for the lineout port of the discman is getting loosei purchased this w the intention of replacing that adapter
everything about the product seems identical but for some reason it doesnt work as well or doesnt work at all in either of my car cassette decks subaru and oldsmobile bose system
it either sticks and cant eject or doesnt play etc
cant figure out the problem
the old adapter still works so its not my deckive run into this problem w a cheaper adapter but thought i would have better luck w this more expensive sony model
looks like nothing works better than the originalskip it
sound quality is only fair
i bought it to use between my palm pilot mp player and my car stereo
later i purchased an fm wireless transmitter that plays through the radio
cheaper and much better soundwhen it works its great
problem is when it pops out of the cassette player at random times causing me distraction from driving to pop it back in and jump back in the podcast to catch what i missed
sometimes it runs for hours without a problem
then it might pop out every  seconds for  times in a row
i had an aiwa version for about  years that never did this in the same cassette player
im going to buy a replacement and wish i had sent this back for a refundworks but is very noisy
we switched it to another car but it was still just as noisy
it is a mechanical sound from plastic parts spinning inside the tape that we are hearingdisappointed but fear the return process so will just use it when we have too
hoped sony would be good seems hard to find a decent quality tape adapter these dayswhile using this connector to forge my ipods stream to the car radio i find it carries some distortion on the high freq making some noise on the cassette player as wellhere is the deal
the model is sony cpac the c means made in china
these things are cheap sound like crap and are from  stock
so you are paying a premium for old new stock
this wont last a monthi am a sony devotee i love sony and it is my brand and i was enjoying the product for what it did
i was able to listen to my ipod in my car and it was great but recently i started to hear clicking
a regular ticking with a pretty consistant period and it drives me crazy
i tested my ipod with headphones and it played perfectly my radio played perfectly so it wasnt my speakers
i just find it frustrating that it only lasted for  months or soi bought a couple of cheap rabbit ears type antennas for tvs in each of the guest rooms and bought the tv as an over the air antenna for a new lcd in the master bedroom
after trying all combination of tvs and antennas this is by far the worst performer
i am in fairfax county outside of washington dc and only  or so miles from the broadcast towers but this antenna has trouble picking up more than  of the  network broadcasts in the area
save your money and look for something elseif you are in a bad reception area most offtheshelf antennas wont help much
terk tv is is not an exception
i bought it  believing the manufacturers sweet techno jargon description hoping it would improve my reception
it did not
tried many antennas before and this one doesnt stick out with anything except the pricei recently bought the small zenith zhdtv hdtvuhf digital indoor antenna and it works much better than this onethis antenna is not worth the high price with this quality of receptionthis has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality i get for my home theater pc
i got nearly the same signal strength from the free antenna that came with my tuner cardpurchased this unit mounted indoors because i got tired of adjusting rabbit ears i refuse to pay month for cable
unfortunately the reception quality is mediocre if not subpar for its price
i get cleaner pictures with my old amplified rabbit ear seti bought the terk tv several years ago because i was desperately trying to find something that gave me good reception so as to avoid cable fees
its expensive and the design is unique so i thought it must be doing something new and betterim using this indoors i have no desire to drill a hole in my wall or whatever would be required to mount this outdoors and like most others im unimpressed
it seems completely random whether channels come in or not
it seems like every few weeks i lose reception and have to move it around to get channels in againa long painful process
its currently propped up against one wall at an exact anglewhich was working for a few weeks but over the weekend i lost reception on most channels againive never been convinced this is any better than a more traditional and cheaper rabbit ear style antenna
in fact im not sure its any better than a  year old antenna designed for fm radio that i use on a different tv
that one sometimes pulls in channels fine that the tv is struggling withit seems like in the st century someone could design an antenna that could reliably pick up local stationsbut this isnt that design
maybe the terk hdtvlp winegard sharpshooter ss will finally be the miracle antenna weve been waiting forupdate on june   this antenna does seem to do better since the digital transition
im much more pleased with its performanceive since found a model that seems to be doing a better job so im planning on relegating this one to a second tv
the newer antenna is the terk fdtva that im going to attempt to link to hereterk fdtva flat digital omni directional amplified indoor antenna blacki have a lot of other nonceiling polk audio speakers throughout the house that sound pretty good these speakers however dont seem to pack much bass though
ive really underwhelmedalthough the item picture clearly shows batteries in a retail blister pack the batteries i received actually came loose in an envelope
these did not look like brandnew batteries
buyer bewarei bought this and was excited to use itset up my ideal entertainment system
simply put one side worked great and the other side didnt
i would classify it as broken out of the box
i cant complain too much since this was dirt cheap but it is always a let down when you buy something that comes to you brokenthis rca balun has a list price of  very misleading
it looks like something you would by off the rack at kmart for about  at most
its packaged in a rack hanging blister pack
dont expect much cheap chinese built product with a old trusted brand nameattached it to a home built antenna and the spade clip ends came off ended up soldering them to my connectors
the coax connection was typical of a cheap product and did not feel like it really connected well
it was worth the  with free shipping but dont expect a higher quality product because of the list priceworked but broke soon after as the screws stripped out
not very powerful connection even when it worked but that could have been from the antennai needed a switch to select between my dish receiver and my pc outputs for sound
the dish receiver works fine with this unit but with the pc signal much noise is introduced
i tried a very expensive shielded cable a very expensive sound card and finally another computer all with the same result
all by itself running through this thing there is a significant and annoying hum added to your signalso if you are running with a pc look for something else
otherwise im sure that this thing will be quite adequate for other av equipmentcables function ok they are not very durable at all
almost like a soft jelly plastic covering the copper lineswhen i realized this was copper coated aluminum i returned this product and bought some pure copper cablestogo speaker wire instead
it is worth x the price to run a superior conductor given the low cost of speaker wire compared to the rest of a home theater systemif you have a  surround system stop reading now because it wont make any difference what you use for speaker cableby far the most important thing in speaker wire is conductivity
the current traveling in speaker wires is very low voltage so you want minimal resistance
consumer grade speaker wire is cheap so cheap it makes no sense to save a few bucks buying a low quality product like this when you can get a much better wire for another 
assuming youre going to be using the wires you make for years a few extra bucks for pure copper and preferably gauge or larger wire is a sound investment especially if youre using long runsbut even with short runs speaker cables can make a difference
i learned that years ago comparing gauge zip cord cables like this except all copper to some gauge speaker cables
the difference was subtle but undeniable
tip if you get conductor gauge and pair the conductors by twisting the ends of pairs at each end the result is equivalent to an gauge cable
how much this wire will compromise your audio compared to gauge copper and whether youll notice the difference varies a lot depending on your audio system your room acoustics your audio source and how good you are at hearing subtle differences
since aluminum is about  less conductive than copper this is roughly equivalent to gauge copper speaker wire
but if you care about the quality of the sound your system is producing splurge a little and at least get pure copper wire
i guarantee all the other wiring in your audio system is made out of copper and theres a reason it isnt made out of aluminumhere are some copper alternatives from a reliable sourcemonoprice ft awg oxygenfree copper speaker wire cableandmonoprice  awg highpurity oxygenfree copper speaker wire
if youre planning to run cables in walls or ceilings youll need cable rated for inwall usemonoprice ft awg cl rated conductor loud speaker cable for inwall installationi decided to return this product for the following reasons i was doing an in wall installation so i wanted to use the properly rated wire its not as intuitive to remember which wire is which both leads are transparent with one having a white stripe across
is white the positive
is it the negative
youre guess is as good as mine but i sure wont remember next time i look at it it is cca
i cant comment on whether or not this affect audio quality but one thing i noticed is that cca is more brittle and less malleable than pure copperi decided to go with a different speaker wire that has insulation has red and black leads call it for dummy but why risking blowing a speaker over damn colors and is pure coppercopper coated aluminum low strand count
garbage wire my speakers sing now that ive replaced this aluminum junk with proper oxygenfree copper wiresi am getting a lot of distortion in my speakersnot sure if its the gauge of speaker wire or the qualitythere is a lot of hissing noisethis did not live up to my expectations
when stripping with wire strippers i found there was almost no way not to strip off some of the strands along with the jacket
overall this just seems like a cheap low quality productok here is some fact about this cable based on my cable investigation which i purchased here this cable is made in china
in my opinion
this is not a real copper cablethis cable is aluminium cable coated with copperhow to investigate  cut the cable look at it
copper cable will show copper color
this cable show white aluminium color open the cable burn the cable
copper will show copperwhen you burn this the copper plating will gone and will show what is inside
and the materials will become weaktry yourself and see if it is true or notcorrect me if i am wrongit workfor the price i didnt expect muchpoor qualitythey break off leaving all the small pieces if you ever gonna take the speaker wires outmaybe i didnt use the proper wire cutterbut it wasnt good quality copper i thoughtso we do get what we paidi bought this because i wanted to have an extra adapter for my headphonesi tested it once or twice to see how it fits and then i left it on a shelf
after a few days i wanted to move the adapter to my audio cables drawer but realized that the female part the bottom part was loosei don t think i can use this product with my hifi rig if it comes apart after being slightly used only  times
thus the  starsi bought this product for my interface and it only actually works when i pull it out a little i dont even use it i use another one i basically wasted my money i feel but its no big deal its cheap who cares i guess i got a dudwasnt what it advertisedthese as other similar adapters seem to be made to fail in no less than an hour
the connections are poor and barely work the quality feels cheap after all it is but finding one built with pro  lasting specs is next to impossible  i cringe whenever i need to use these and am  sick off making excuses to client why one ear is out whips the signal drops when the move two inches to the left etc
id say stay away but i dont have another suggest where to get anything betterthis plug is very loose fitting on the mm side it always gives me feed back with my yamaha sv violin
dont expect the mm side to activate your pedals either you need something in between that uses  jacks to do thatthe product in this listing changes when you select from three sizes at the main listing
but not only does the size change but the style also changes from backpack for a larger laptop to a sleeve for a netbook to the clamshell case
problem is amazon lumps reviews of the three different products together as if they were simply different sizes of the same product
so its hard to understand whats being said about the product in which youre interested
but maybe you figured that outthe clamshell case is a really bad idea
netbooks and laptops generally must be operated on a solid surface so that their ventilation holes arent blocked and their radiating surfaces are exposed
dont use your netbook while its in a soft case on a bedspread etcfinally im looking for a case that will fit my  inch netbook a wireless mouse a couple of usb drives some cables the power brick and its wires an external dvd drive and a couple of dvds
maybe space for a cell phone or an mp player
this case apparently aint it
neither is the wellmade caselogic case
whats so weird about needing just a little more space and some serious paddingthis was a great player
it would do just about anything i threw at it  dvds vcds svcds mp jpeg and so on and so onthen after about  months of owning this device i was watching my brand new band of brothers dvd set when on disc  it warned me that the disc needed cleaning error disc minor  clean me
it then started to skip every  seconds or so
i took the disc out and it was fine
i thought the unit may have overheated i had watched disc one just before and was on episode  on disc  so i let the unit sit a bit
i then tried it again
this time it wouldnt even play the disc
error disc major  replace me
i tried another disc same thing
i tried the discs in another player and they worked fine
i let the unit sit overnight same results the next day
i ran a cleaning disc in the player then tried it again
same resultsi contacted apex tech support
i was told that i would be charged minimum not including sh to have the device even looked at back at the factorythe player is now collecting dust in my closet and has been replaced with an philips dvd playerthis is a good unit but beware it has trouble playing variable bitrate svcds
if your svcd bitrate drops below a certain level the picture will freeze and the audio will emit a high pitched squeal
if svcd playback is important to you get a different player otherwise you will be ok with the adto me rechargable means indefinite use not conks out after  months
we bought the camera and an extra battery   for a long time everything worked well  we went on a vacation  and took loads of pictures with only one recharge during the whole week
but sometime around jan  the charges started being shorter and shorter
eventually around may it got to the point where we could take  photos or one movie and then the battery died
i have just recently emailed sony and they replied that since our batteries have no memory effect loss of function due to recharging your battery is faulty and needs replacementi am very fond of technology some sort of developeri used to be crazy about sony stuff
stereos phones hand helds cameras i had them all
but anytime i had a problem the support of sony was lousy sometimes non
i even got the regional levels to get some help but nothing not even a replyi wasted or sold any sony device i had
i wouldnt buy anything with the sony logo on it anymore
i rather became a sony terrorist always speaking bad about itits a pity cause sony makes good things but they are always trying to imprison the customers with closed technology and dont treat them properlyi have a dscfv camera that takes this battery
i contacted sony to see if maybe they had one that would last longer after reading the many bad reviews
they said they didnt but they dont even make this battery anymore  you should get the npfs battery instead
heres hoping they fixed some of the problems with the battery in this newer version
i did however do as one of the other posters sucggested on burning the battery completely out b recharging and it seems to have worked at least temporarily so we dont have to get a new one right away
weve had the camera for about  years
the battery started giving us trouble after about  months and we have been crippling it along ever since
when it indicates the battery is low we just shut it off and then turn it back on and that would give us enough time to take one or two pictures b the low battery indicator would start again
we could do this many time before the thing would shut down completely and fail to turn back onive had exactly the same problems as everyone else  i have two infolithium npfs batteries which have been apparently less and less able to hold a charge as time goes on
i reached the point where i wouldnt even bother to take my sony dscp out with me anymore
the batteries would last for two or three pictures then the camera would shut itself off
thank goodness i found these reviews
i was about to buy two new replacements having no idea that everyone has the same problem with these batteries
i followed the prevailing advice and sure enough the results are a spectacular reversal of fortunes  a saving of almost 
i killed one battery by taking picture after picture with the flash 
i eventually got to  pictures at  pixel resolution having to switch the camera on again probably  or  times when the quotbattery lifequot indicator came on and powered down the camera
ignoring what the cameras telling you will mean that you will continue taking pictures for a long time
the camera actually gets hot its being used so much
eventually the camera goes really dead and the lens wont retract
now im recharging the battery pretty confident that the old battery will be rejuvinated to its formerly effective self
this is exactly the advice given in the other reviews
however for the second battery rather than trying to quickly start taking photos before the battery life is calculated by the camerabattery i let the calculation go ahead first
the camera indicated that the battery life was  minutes
i immediately started taking pictures and got up to  pictures using the flash
again the camera got quite hot in the time it took to take all those pictures
and even after all that time and all those pictures the camera showed that this second battery still had  minutes left in it
odd
what im thinking is that it might not be entirely necessary to quotkillquot your battery in order to make it work properly
maybe what you need to do  to kick your battery in the pants  is just take picture after picture for a few minutes as soon as you turn the camera on and itll reset the info part of the battery
worth a try
obviously you might need to do this every  months or when you notice the performance dropping off
already this second battery is behaving like it used to  even without killing iti have a hypothesis about the problem and why this quottreatmentquot of your battery might breath new life into it
we tend to use our cameras in a very specific way that may be foiling the functionality of the infolithium system
we turn on the camera in preparation for taking pictures but it could be several minutes before we take a single picture
and we tend not to take pictures in rapid succession once we start
i think this cycle of switching the camera on then doing little or nothing with it makes the battery go into some kind of quotinfocomaquot after repeating this pattern for a long time
i wonder if the way this technology was developed failed to take this realworld factor into consideration
i speculate that the laboratory testing of this device probably involved discharging the battery immediately after the battery life indication had been calculated
maybe that process is what the battery needs to calibrate itself
after months of never receiving that treatment its possible that the battery no longer quotknowsquot what the hells going on
id be curious to know if other people have the same results as i have
email me if you like at nowissbcglobalneti have been surprised and dissappointed in this battery
this is the battery that my camera uses and because i always use what is recommended for my products i felt purchasing this sony battery would be good
wee it worked for a couple times and today when i turned on the camera it says  for infolithium battery only
it then procedes to turn off
i threw my old battery out same kind as this one and now without a camera
would not order againit works well but it doesnt hold a charge for too long after about  months
i just us the power outlet from the wall nowdid not last very longthese dont seem to be true sony batteriesi think they were counterfeit did not last as long as original sony batteriesplease dont buy apex
it is the only electronics product that i have purchased that breaks in less than  days
my apex stopped working for dvds after seeing  movies
the laser went out of line so it has be shipped in for repairs
i am going to get my money back and buy from a reliable companyi wrote a review on this dvd player  weeks ago giving it  stars and praising how well it worked how many features it had and what a great deal it was
well  days after writing that review my apex  started acting up
the main problem is that when i put in a dvd it will sit there for a while and finally say no disc
i have to eject and reinsert the dvd  times before it will finally detect the disc
i have tried this on many different mint conditions dvds
music cds play just fine it has no trouble detecting them
but i mainly use it for dvds and it gets annoying reinserting the dvd so many times each time you want to use iti decided to open up the player to have a look inside and it seems that the wiring inside is cheap and poorly designed
from what i can tell the movement of the dvd tray has bent and split a paper thin electronic ribbon
i imagine with time the split will become so bad that the player will stop working entirely but thats just a guessdont trust any review written by someone who has owned this player for less than  months
like i say it may work great during that time but after that the problems start show uptheres a reason that bose doesnt disclose the stats on their speakers
its because they are very inefficient and basically only reproduce the middle range in a muddy fashion
i sold my vcs after  weeks and replaced it with a klipschwhat a difference
it was only  more but is a light year better
dont waste your money on this piece of junk it will disappoint youi originally purchased a set of bose s about fifteen years ago when i was in high school
i inherited the bose center channel from a friend and have been looking to replace it for a long time
its not a terrible speaker its just a lot of money for something that produces slightly average sound
youll notice that people who were generous to this speaker claim that bose is known for exceptional sound quality  but i challenge anyone to find an audiophile who would agree with that statement
bose products are typically overmarketed and price fixed products built on technology straight out of the s
i strongly suggest anyone looking to purchase a home audio system turn to the web and do their research
for a lot less you can get a lot more eg paradigmi have a question for those people that rated this item with  stars did it get  stars because sound came out of it when you hooked it up or did you actually compare it to any other speakers
yes it has a small neat design but it sounds bad
try comparing this speaker before you buy and i guarantee youll immediately see what i mean
the bose vcs sounds so much worse than even the cheapest  bookshelf speaker you can pick up from any of your local stores
the center channel is such an important part of your surroundsound system  i wouldnt even use this in the  kmart allinone surroundsound system
if you want something that looks pretty buy a nice ornament and put it on top of a decentsounding centerchannel speaker i own a bose vcs center channel
i would say that it is a good speaker for certain applications
you will find worst and your will find better
a few thoughts  many indicate that the speaker will sound better by adjusting your receiver
true
and that holds true for any speaker
and just be cautious when listening to audio at the storesthey will many times play specially tuned cds catered to the particular speaker
bring your own cds to listen to you own soundtracks  it is a slim design
true
at the same time you can find a few others that are just as small or smaller
i would say that it is a matter of personal preference of style
what i find is that the bose vcs works out great with my old secondary tv
about the right size
but switching to a  widescreenit doesnt look right and not integratedand quality and volume of sound doesnt matchthe best advice i can give is to go listen to the speaker for yourself and inspect the constructionand how does it fit in your entertainment center
compare to other speakers for sound and appearanceother reviewers may say that the bose center channel made a world of difference to them
it might have in terms that it is an upgrade from their previous center channel or the bose is their first
againyou will want to listen to all center channelsand you will discover that there are many center channels that can better articulate audiothe biggest advice is in a home theatremake sure to get an excellent center channel
that is where most of the action is over  of audio content and which will make a difference
focus on the center before you worry about the subwoofer and other surround sound speakersbose is good but i have moved on to other center channels by other makers
the bose center channel sounds muddy voices dont sound any better than what you hear from standard tv speakers music scores arent impressive and the speaker soundtimbre dont match any other speakers in a home theatre systemthis surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size
i have an air conditioner and timer plug that are fairly large and cover more than their own outlet
as a result i am returning this product
a design flaw in my opinion and not reflected accurately in the pictureit seemed so compact and useable and iliked the idea of the volume controli found it was too annoying and i did not hearwell with it
not sure if it was just me but findi am not using it and tend to use just regularsmall ear phones that fit well in my pocketmaybe ok if you have a small camera but its too flimsy to support an slr
which isnt necessarily a bad thing its small after all butvanguard vs flexible minitripodis at least as cheap and is sturdy enough to do the job plus its better looking in my opinioni really wouldnt recommend using this tripod with anything other than the smallest and lightest of digital cameras
it is just so small a thing
too small for mealso pulling out the leg extensions on mine is dreadfully difficult
too tight
it is difficult for me to get good enough a grip on them with my fingertipsconclusionif you have a tiny lightweight camera to use with this tiny tripod it might be acceptable to youi was excited to receive this item as i have lost two lens caps in the past
as soon as i took it out of the package i immediately attached it following the instructions to the letter
there is no problem with the sticky part staying put on the lens cap
the problem is with the little string that is attached to the elastic band
the second time i removed the lens cap from the camera the little string disconnected from the elastic
so now i have a little string hanging from the lens cap that isnt attached to anything
this is a cheap piece of junk
dont buy itit is just okey
will work for some time but the glue start coming off very soon as you take the camera to different atmospheric conditions
not very stablei cant recommend this turntable
its cheap junk
ive had it for a few years but ive never used it much at all
its spent  of that time in the box
in the last month i started listening to more vinyl though buying a few jazz lps off ebay
now when i move the needle to the playing position it wants to retract and stop
i can get it to work but then it will start doing it again
i opened it up to try to figure out what was going on with it
i can see whats causing the behavior but i dont really know what happened to make it do what its doing
its like there is something missing
i got annoyed looking at the stupid cheap design of the thing and just resolved to buy a new one not sony with direct drive that will hopefully lasti bought this tt last spring and here is what i think about it so farthe term you get what you pay for certainly applies to this turn table
i wish i would have done more research before buying this product
not that its horrible its a decent turntable
my biggest complaint is the hum you hear that i cannot get rid of
plus it does make some popping sounds even on brand new records
the best feature for me is that all you have to do is press the start button and the record will automatically start playing and when its done the arm will automatically go back into place
and as many others have stated the rca cable is way too short
but the built in pre amp does come in handy if your a receiver doesnt have a phono out putbottom line is if you are not looking for a dynamic sounding turn table and are just looking for something to listen to the old records in your collection than this would suffice
but if you are looking to utilize your records at the highest level g and want to hear the high definition sound that they can produce then spend the extra money and get one of the higher end ttsive had this turntable for about   years now and it worked well for most of that time
in the past few months the speed became unstable an extremely disorienting thing to listen to and it recently bit the dust completely
the turntable has a number of things in its favor especially the builtin preamp can be switched on or off to work with new amplifiers without phono inputs
the sound is good and the price is right but its not a model of reliabilityive bought  appliances this year that have worked a week or less or not at all a conair and a wahl hair trimmer a teac cd changer from amazon and a sony camcorder
what is happening with quality control any morefrom amazon i purchased this turnatable which worked for a week
then everytime the needle touched down on the record it instantly lifted back up and returned to its resting hook then turned offits tough enough reaching a decision to buy a certain model or product but to have to go thru the hassle of returning it has me soured on buying
ill make my tv my computer and my monitor do even though id like and i have the money to replace them because im fed up with lousy workmanship and repacking stuff for returnsi paid about  for this turntable one year ago
the biggest problem with this turntable is that even the slightest floor vibrations cause obnoxious bass thumps that make my speakers bounce like crazy
and dont turn the amp too loud or the vibrations from the speakers cause obnoxious feedback through the turntable
this turntable needs some kind of shocks or suspension to absorb floor vibrations
when the needle hits the record or is lifted it also causes loud bass thumps through my speakers that strain the ampspeakers
another problem with this turntable is that the rca output cable is literally  foot long i am not exaggerating
so if you plan on placing the turntable more than a foot away from your amp youll need to invest in an rca extension cord and an rca femalefemale converter
i wont comment on the audio quality because this is the only turntable ive ever owned but it seems mediocre to me
once again another chintzy sony product they really make junk these daysi bought this and returned it within  hours
i hooked this up to two different radios grundig boston and tested it on am stations that were weak in my area
there was absolutely no difference in reception with or without this attached
my future solution will be buying a house where i can put up a large outdoor loop antennai thought these ties could be reopened like some other ones i have
oh well they were still pretty cheapwhile the product works well as a a trackball mouse i found it lacking in precision compared to a traditional optical mouse
if you like trackable mice this is nice product to get
just be sure that you want a trackball mousejust dont like the layout
very hard to get used to the buttons since theyre so small
really got used to the microsoft trackball explorer and since they stopped making them i guess im stuck with this
its about the closest i can find to itthe optical marble works as designed but unfortunately its not designed very well
many years ago i switched to a logitech marble wheel because a traditional mouse was causing me hand pain
the marble wheel positions the hand so it rests naturally and the ball is manipulated by the thumb its very comfortable and quite accurate
i wanted another for my laptop and was shocked to find the marble wheel had been discontinued and now goes for  on ebay or used at amazon
so i purchased the marble mouse which of course isnt a mouse at all instead
bad choice its not only awkward to use but requires an even more unnatural hand position than a traditional mouseits painful to use because it requires you to hold your hand in an arched position and manipulate the ball with your index finger
this terrible design would only be suited to those who have to share a pc with a lefty and then only if both people were unable to use a regular mouse
avoid itthe best alternative right now is the logitech trackman wheel which replaced the old marble wheel
its smaller less comfortable and requires you to use your middle finger rather than index finger to click
but its still much better than a traditional mouse or this marble mouse because you can use your thumb to manipulate the ball
it will take a while for new users to grow accustomed to but once you do youll never want to use a regular mouse againmeanwhile im going to put my marble mouse up on ebay
you can avoid that hassle by buying something else in the first placethe setpoint software from logitech seems to crash when you use this particular product for scrolling
i have several mice and trackballs from logitech and all function perfectly with the same setpoint software
only this mouse gives problems and crashes setpoint
it happens consistendly on both my pcsthe ball is large and comfortable to use
buttons are large
but in this time and age you need a dedicated scrolling wheel somewhere on a mouse or trackballhaving to press both buttons to activate scrolling is definitely tedioustry the wireless trackman instead or if you prefer using your fingers rather than the thumb for moving the ballthe optical trackmanive had this for mouse for almost two years
love the fact that i could program the buttons for what i needed
during that time ive had it i would have to reinstall the logic center software and drivers
sometimes i would get full function back most of the time i wouldnt
logitech makes great products but when it comes to support and available information they really suckseveral of the internal connectors to the pcb were loose so channels were intermittent in copying between cassettes or from external sources
the pcb also needed more offset mounts to prevent bendingi replaced my old motorola modem with this one hoping for an increase in speed
i got what i wanted  my speed almost doubled the old modem had started to degrade so im not claiming that it is going to double everyones speed
i also noticed that i had to start performing resets a lot more often
after some research into the matter i found that this model has a lot of trouble staying connected while under maximum load
i went to the website to see if there were any firmware upgrades available but linksys only provides updates to isps and does not allow users to upgrade the product that they have paid for
after finding that out i decided to replace my linksys because i use every last bit of my bandwidth and i dont want to be resetting the modem  times a day which is about how often i was having to do it
if you need a faster modem try dlinks dcm modem
its  cheaper than linksys provides faster speeds and posts all its firmware updates onlinethe befcmu version  cable modem is not linksys best product
it is unstable requires a reset about twice a week and has long latency under high traffic
i was running a voice over ip connection over this cable modem
i had poor performance and poor reliabilityreplaced this with a motorola surfboard sb
the sb performs much better with much lower latency
greatly improves the quality of my voip service and never requires a resetwait for a new release version 
or buy a sbwhat
microoft got something right
in this case yes
the intellimouse is simply the best mouse ive ever used
provided you use the driver shipped with it and not the windows default drivers you can customize all  buttons on the mouse
i have mine configured so that the wheel button does a doubleclick and the rightside button does showhide desktop since i hide my taskbar in windows
the other  buttons i use the defaultsergonomically it fits my hand perfectly and is comfortable to use
i bought my first intellimouse  years ago for my laptop and had to put it into service on my desktop when that dell mouse scroll wheel broke after a year
it made such a difference on my desktop that i bought  brand new intellimice one to replace the broken dell mouse and one for workupdate  i have had to lower my rating of this mouse from five stars to just two because after about a year the mouse became impossible to use
the scroll wheel jumps back and forth without my hand anywhere near the mouse
it started doing this less than a year after buying it but it was infrequent at first
as time went on it got worse and worse and now every time i go to click on something the screen jumps  a lot  and i wind up clicking on something farther up or down the page than i wanted to
i had to turn off oneclick buying because of this i accidentally bought something i was just browsing fori didnt have any of these problems with my first intellimouse but the two i bought in  have become completely unusable
for now im using a cheap button mouse until i can find a new button mouse with the features that i liked about the intellimouse without the headachesive used several of the ms optical intellimouse for years so when my old one finally became gunked up beyond reason i didnt hesitate to replace it with a new one
unfortunately the newly minted versions have a different scroll wheel design
instead of operating smoothly with just a slight bumpy feel for each increment the scroll wheel now feels loose and it rattles in operation
i thought id received a defective unit and exchanged it  but the exchange intellimouse was just the same
it works fine but its unpleasant and annoying to use
ill probably replace it with a logitech mouse before too much longerthe extra buttons for paging back and forth are a nice touch but the mouse itself is somewhat bulky and large and after a few hours of use my wrist starts to seize up no onehanded typing jokes please
ive had to scale down to a logitech optical mouse insteadive seen the other reviews and fully expected to have an excellent experience w the optical mouse but within  minutes i knew i had made a mistakei like to have a minimum of mouse movement so i turn the sensitivity of my mouse up high
im used to having  inches of side to side mouse movement make the pointer cross my  x screen
hooking up the optical mouse i found it very similar to my analog mouse  at first
but then i noticed that the pointer while moving fine on strict horizontal or vertical motions seemed to stutter on diagonal motions
trying to move the pointer on a  degree angle across the screen i could see the pointer shuddering slightly but not making any real progress
moving it faster would then make the pointer jump way beyond where i intended it to go
at this point i dont know if it was my mouse settings the pad i was using tried several or the optical mouse itself but i got very frustrated not being able to control it as precisely as i had before so i returned it
im now the proud owner of  
logitech optical mice and love themthe telezapper has been a very poor substitute for ameritechs privacy manager which worked  of the time
the telezapper may have reduced some of the telemarketing calls but it has definitely not eliminated them and weve had it for months
id recommend looking into alternatives before buying a telezappercase was cracked when it arrived and it did not work or solve the problem that i needed it for
disappointed
amazon was great about the return as usuali purchased a quot xquot lexar  mb cf card for my minolta dimage  expecting that it would store large images faster than the much cheaper  mb cf card i already had delkin devices efilm
i was disappointed the lexar card was even slower than the delkin card
 meg images take  seconds to store with the bargin cf card
the lexar card takes  or  seconds longerat low resolutions theres no appreciable difference
i recommend buying the cheapest cf card that will work with your camerai just enjoyed this speakers system with my laptop computer for  months then suddenly one of the speakers started to give off static noises then the condition became worse and worse the noises changed into unbearable firecrackerlike sharp cracking irregular sounds
when i tried to look into the mesh cover i seemed to notice that the top of the two got a crack
i knew they were slim pairs of speakers and i am not a hardhearing person so i never turned the volume so loud that the vibrations of the sounds might damage it but it just happened
theres no way to find a replacement so i have to throw away the bad one and retired the whole system
what a shame because the sound actually not bad for such a small  sound system
so if i could find the same used model in some thrift stores under  i might buy it any price over  simply not worth itit works ok except for when the pointer suddenly jumps to the other side of the screen
why does it do this
i have no idea
it seems to happen about every  minutes on average
my other kensington mouse full size doesnt have this problem so i expect this is a problem with the pocket mouse in particular
im going to replace it with something more stable
ill just save it for use as a backup mousewhen i first got this clie i was very impressed
overall it is a good product but putting songs on the memeory stick was a huge hassle with sonys check incheck out program
i finally found out how to attach it as a drive to my computer and then you can just copy songs very easily
one month after i purchased this product sony came out with two new clies though they seem to be priced to high i felt cheated
i would recommend getting a palm m
first i like the idea of media cards where you can upload a map or whater you want
also most other accesories are geared towards a palm product
i wanted to get a cheap gps addon for the clie and it doesnt exist
altough i have seen one for a palm
once again i feel cheated out of a cool feature
i think i will sell it on ebay and get a mi bought this handheld after seeing its impressive screen
i tried to find accessories for it like a case without messy velcro and could not find anything
it wasnt even because they were out of stockthey dont sell the decent accessories for it in the usa
the only way to get half way decent accessories is to find someone in japan
i found myself wishing that i stayed with the palm pilots every where i went they had tons of neat accessories to pick from
i returned the clie and bought a palm m and now i am happy
i have been able to find everything that i want and need to have plus some other extra goodies
i still like the screen of the clie much betterbut to have to worry about carrying it around without a caseis not for a busy working mother of twoi have tried to use this item inside and it has not proven to increase reception
save your moneyi wish i had read the reviews here before following the manufacturers claim which was reprinted in the product description on amazon
the good news is that its well made
the bad news is that contrary to the claim that it holds all your gps cables brackets and the unit itself its only good for carrying or storing the gps unit itself
also the price is excessive considering that it doesnt do as claimed
do yourself a favor  and spare yourself some disappointment while saving some money  take your gps to an electonics store compusa best buy etc
and buy a good padded camera bag which will hold everything for about  the priceive owned and used probably  or  webcams over the years and this one has been one of the worst
i bought it at walmart because it was so cheap 
 and felt like i had nothing to loose in trying it
well it performs like a  webcam
the picture is pretty bad except under full sunlight
and no amount of tweeking with software controls can make a lowerlight picture look decent
grainy bad contrast and colorshiftedthe quality of the video ist good at all
i get it at a good price but with that resolution of video i understand whyget a better model or try other optionsthey are nice to keep things organized
not a big deal but collects dust so you have to keep up with it
i dontnice looking but when we put it togetherthe holes underneath did not match for the  nuts to screw intosome of the accessories are too cheap quality they brokeive owned this cd rack for almost an entire decade
it holds up well through moves and it did its job in holding cds
unfortunately there are too many problems with this cd rack to justify any price point above  it stands well on bare floors or very short carpet but if you have medium carpets this thing will tip over as soon as you touch it if you attempt to move it its very easy for the metal portion to become detached from the base plate
you have to either slide it across the floor using your foot to kickslide it or waddle it to your new location
or you can take it off the base plate and move it separately since there are sections that hold several cds if you attempt to take the bottom cd out of a section you have to hold the rest of the cds in place as theyll also fall out due to gravityfriction
if you have this cd rack sitting on mediumthick carpet this also causes the entire rack to tip overdespite what others say my mouse became skippy and sometimes even very slow especially when a program is active or running
sometimes the mouse would just freeze for several seconds
but sometimes it happens out of nowhere
my old ms optical mouse never had any problems
also the buttons are too small
sometimes when i clicked the right mouse button i pressed the edge
the only good thing about this mouse is that it looks decentgranted the product is very cheap but i decided to try it out
it is pretty noisy about like a old cassette tape with no dolby
if you listen to rock and pop you probably wont notice it that much
the  eq bands do what they should and help warm up the the smaller ear buds and phonesi bought this unit about year ago for 
worked as expected although the remote needs work
the record button is too close to the channel changer
the buttons are the size of ticktacs but smaller
self light button only works with top vcr controls and not tv or keypad
auto time doesnt always work and manually setting the vcr features is a real pain and i do computer programming
it does have a power off memory incase of blackouts
my system stopped recording tv shows and so i checked the manual
yes the vcr has its record tab and indicates its recording on the proper cable channel
i just recorded a show last night so all i believe the heat just was to much for it  deg f i went through the online sites and i get the same check your tabs and cables
i done that so its got to be electronics
now i got a fancy player until i can get schematics to fix it
its not worth sending back to the company
out of warranty  days labor
im an amateur tech
ill fix it
get one thats heat resistant or get a cooling fan for iti purchased this as a secondary vcr to my sony slvn
during the first few months i had no problems at all
the remote is pretty decent and has well layed out buttons
the image quality and sound isnt very good at all and is of much lower quality than that of my equally priced sony slvn
the sony has its problems and its the best vcr but i would easily say its better than this one
this is most likely the worst vcr ive owned
just recently the image quality has been getting worse and worse
i play certain tapes and the picture is all fuzzy
tapes recorded on another vcr in epslp are nearly unviewable
whats strange about this vcr is that it now seems to pick up more of a fuzzy picture than when playing it in my other new vcrs
dirty heads you ask
cleaned them as usual not with a tape cleaner and still the same
cleaned every part that can cause problems and still the same
i also have to mention that  months ago all my tapes started to get a faint horizontal blue line with what looked like fuzzy quotnoisequot in it in them
about  of them that were played
now i have a bunch of tapes that are bad
turns out that when i opened up my vcr there was a bunch of gunk on a roller guide
causing this line
i find it strange that this would so easily happen after just  months of use
i guess i must play a lot of rented tapes
to bad there isnt a vcr out there that wouldnt pick up this garbage so easily
auto head cleaners are useless i think
btw you might like to know that the most reliable vcr ive ever had was err is a philco  head mono vcr
purchased it in  and its still going
just cleaned the heads for the first time and it still plays perfectly fine
next best would be an old rca home theater  head hifi vcr which they dont make anymore
best picture quality ive seen in a vcr actually
to bad the poor thing died in just under a yearpretty good price on this camera
you know why
its so you can spend the money you saved on batteries
i should know we sell these at the store where i work
probably  of the ss we sell are returned because people cant use them for a normal period of time without the batteries going deadi suggest you look at the nikon  or canon ss
youll thank me latermust say that im very disappointed in this product
a stupid rush decision based on reading other reviews normally a great way to choose  prompted by deadline for a rebate
ironically im far happier with my much cheaper zirecons battery and cradlepoor battery life is an understatement  you can practically watch the battery drain
after about a half hour of use i noticed the battery had already depleted by about onethird
what makes this particularly annoying is the physical means to charge
the large heavy poweradapter must be connected to the cradle which in turn is connected to the usb connectorwhat a mess of cables and doodads to deal with
not something i care to keep about near my cpu let alone travel with
i need to spend another  bucks just to remedy this situation
hot sync headachesbesides the physical nuisance hotsyncing using the default software failed frequently  out of  times while attempting to sync via a powered usb hub a hub that works fine with all other devices ive connected
so i broke down and attached it to the cpu  something i loath to do given that palms website warns that its likely ill need to plugunplug regularly should i upgrade to desktop  imho this is unaceptable wear and tear on a builtin port not mac friendly  too many special problems limitations for mac userspros the screens ok and fairly readable much better than the zire in poor light since its backlit 
but theres no real means to lower the brightness which is probably why the battery drains instantaneously you can adjust contrast but i doubt that this will have much effect on the battery
in full light the zire is just as readableoverview i bought this model even tho id didnt care about color assuming the zire might be very limited given its low ram which turned out to be a nonissue
i wish there was a highend greyscale alternative  but the manufacturers all seem to be moving to color
i wish apple who seems to know how to design things would get into this marketi gave this  stars instead of one cause the device functionssadly this is case where i shouldve gone down to a brick and mortor store first even if id opted to buy online lateraleighpalm os is great i used to have a sony palm great product
this one i ordered doesnt have the same quality
if you tap on the screen the accuracy is not there at all
my mistake is that i cut the upc code too early and cant return this item any morei found it for  and like messing around with old elctronic gadgetsif you feel safe downloading from s of random websties theirs alot of different apps for it like countdown clocks and maps
i tried downloading some things onto an sd card for it but couldnt get it to work
if you find one for  the only thing its good for is a digital memo pad
you can get another palm handheld that does x as much as it does for the same price or you could by a tablet or an ipad
pdas have died out becuase cell phones can do the same thing
pdas were originally used for bussiness time killers and checking flightsevery other review is from  or  which is when it came out  back then it was really good for people who had the money for itthe palm m is everything the m should have been and should have been a year ago
now however in light of other more advanced pdas by competing companies i think you can name at least two the m just seems outdated and too little too latelets start with the screen
it certainly is not high res and certainly holds nothing on sonys models
the vertical black grids are very annoying after continuous usage something that you wouldnt have on a sony  or nr or even palms lower end color model the m
the screen isnt bad at displaying colors in fact it has very good color definition
but that is cancelled out by the blocky pixels and gridlines that you should not have on an expensivepda
im still wondering why palm chose only three viewing abilities for its backlight none low and high versus a regular bar that lets you control viewability
low seems a little too low and high although its very bright  wears down the batteries fast
the none setting is all but worthless unless you are outside using it which i never amalso another question mark is the lack of a simple jog dial
i have a lowend sony s since discontinued that has a jog dial and it is wonderful
all sonys have this but for some reason the top of the line palm does not
it is simply a mystery especially when other companies such as handspring include jog dials on some of their new modelson the plus side this pda looks real nice and professional
if it only had a jog dial the form would be the best
its not a very good pda especially for the price and it should have been what the m wasnt
but since its palm it will sell even though it is inferior compared with all sony models and a couple handspring treo seriesnot bad but save your money until the fall when os handhelds are out or get a clie now because it has most of the features os will have only without the arm processoryah its cheap
really really butt kickingly wonderfully cheap
this is cheapest way to get to mm
it wont autofocus on the low end nikon dslrs though
 if the user guide of your low end nikon dslr is telling you about lens compatibility issues you can assume that this one wont work eitherso is it worth it
if you cant autofocus no its not worth it
the f aperture means that when you look through the lens its gonna be dark
even if youre willing to manually focus the thing the view through the viewfinder is too dark to see clearly so focusing is going to be hardnow what if you have a midgrade nikon camera that can autofocus this thing
id still say no for two reasons
first the lens is soft
your pictures wont be sharp
if its the only lens youve ever used except for your kit lens youll have to trust me on this
pretty much every other nikon lens out there is sharper than this one
second the physics of taking picture with a mm f lens on a dx camera mean that youre only going to get a decent picture in bright bright sunshine
clouds
early or late in the day
indoors
forget it
youre either going to have to crank the iso up so that the picture is noisy or youre going to have to use a shutter speed thats so slow that you get camera shake in every shoti had this lens once upon a time and always thought the problem was that i was a bad photographer
now that i know more i realize that it was this awful lens
the best thing i ever did was sell itrecommendations
the   vr lens is quite good
its somewhere around  but its worth saving for
another recommendation if you want cheaper is the  vr
it doesnt have as much reach but at  its actually quite good for the price
both of these lenses have afs so they will work on the low end nikon dslrs tooi dont think i need to repeat the great reviews on this item but i can tell you that it works very well with my d
the auto focus is pretty fast even at low light unlike some of the comments i saw
the auto focus nikon body has a male drive pin that engages to the female pin on the lens ring and the focus locks it plenty fast for most applications
you need to make sure that you engage the auto focus switch next to the lens lock button on front of the d body
switch it off for manual focus otherwise you will not be able to move the focus ring
being able to use this motorless lens was one of the main reasons why i purchased the d because it just saved me  getting this lens
i am sure a  lens will be faster but since i dont use this lens much it suits my need quite well
just took a photos of a duck zoomed in all the way and compared it with my   nikor zoom the difference is day and night due to the optical zoom of course
now i can take photos of birds
cant see any reason to spend  for a dozen photos a year which is what my usage rate is
the lens has no vr so i braced myself and took a photo of a duck and the result is stunning
i compared the same photo with a friends with the  and i must say the result is better on the mm since it is really a mm optical zoom
not really a fair comparison since it is twice the zoom but now i can clearly see no reason to get the  my  with the  give me the complete range coverage i need
i dont make a living with photography and i cant really tell the difference between photos taken with this lens and a  lens unless i put them side by side
if there is a difference you would have to use a magnifying glass i am sure
the photos are just great already
i would not buy this lens if i have a d because it will not work with auto focus
there is a sigma lens for  more if you have the d not sure the result you will get with that lens
i have an old sigma lens which is just horrible but this was purchased  years ago i think a lot has changed since
if you have the d or any focus motor body nikon camera and want to save big money you will be very pleased that you get this oneupdate after comparing with other lens this lens is not sharp enoughon the nikon d this lens has no af if that is what you are looking for
i returned mine for the nikon mm which also has the vr and im looking forward to using as soon as it arrivesthese are my first telephoto lens i dont like  optical quality of pictures are not sharp with some cromatical aberration and its noisy
good autofocus
i think is better to save more money and get another like  vri like  to take pictures of birds and animals but the pictures are not sharp maybe to other needs but not mineit could be that mine are defectivesecond revisionnow im using a monopod i get better results my pictures still look a litle blurry at mm im taking pictures at mm  with very nice results i had a great first few weeks with my clie
lots of memory good screen handy controls good bundled softwarebut last week it didnt turn on
ive tried all the normal tricks without success
the sony support site was not very helpful quottry a soft resetquot
and sony tech support hasnt responded to my messagesstatistically speaking yours probably wont break
if it works youll love iti bought a  camera a few years ago and it works fine and takes good pictures but the batteries go dead after every use which can get expensive if you do not have rechargable ones
also the software is not very good at all
it does have a  lot of options though such as stop action motion detect and video
i eventually wound up buying a real camera that uses rechargable batterieshad this connected up to an old watt amp
gain was at half on amp
blew in  min
not sure if it was me or subi purchased a pair of linksys befvp units to connect two office networks and to provide for secure remote network access through vpns to mobile users
while the units performed the former job adequately the latter left a lot to be desiredi should have known better when presented with linksys confusing marketing information
in one breath from their web site they say quotno ipsec vpn client software neededquot while in another say quotmobile workers can also connect to a corporate network using an ipsec based vpn client software solutionquot as usual theres a slight gulf between marketing spin and realityfor pctobox connections such as those with mobile users its true that no special client software is needed
windows  and xp users can in fact connect to the befvp without special software but only if the computer has a static ip address
whether on local networks or in a coffee shop hotspot its unlikely the typical desktop user will have a static ip address which translated means that in fact vpn client software is needed to make these units useful in that remote network access rolethats because the befvp supports only ipsec
commonly used windowsbased vpns use pptp or ltp both of which are built into windows
but this unit and most others doesnt provide pptp or ltp supportback to the requirement then for aftermarket ipsec vpn software
the software is not inexpensive and it adds considerably to the total cost of this linksys solution
i tested the ipsec client from french company thegreenbow and it does work
the problem is that there is no dhcp or other types of dynamic addressing or dns support its merely a quotrawquot network pipe
for most mobile users this isnt going to be particularly functional and thats especially true for users of networks that use windows active directory
perhaps the other recommended option the softremote vpn client addresses this but either way its a costly addon
all of this left me searching for ways to get pptp support without buying other hardware
the suggestion widely made was to merely configure a windows server behind the firewall to offer pptp and configure the linksys befvp to pass pptp through
simply put this doesnt worklinksys web site features a tech note on how to configure this very scenario
however had anyone at linksys actually tested the tech note they would have discovered it doesnt work
the tech note suggests port mapping ports  pptp and  supposedly for gre a protocol necessary for pptp to work properly
the problem is that quotquot is not a port number it is the protocol number of gre
mapping port  in the firewall has absolutely no impact whatever on the gre protocol
whoever wrote the tech note clearly has very little understanding of the subject matterit is possible that some linksys firewalls will work with pptp passthrough but the befvp clearly does not
empirical evidence suggests that the gre protocol is not properly handled internally to support the passthrough scenario
the connection can be made to port  on a windows server behind the firewall when passed through the linksys but without proper gre handling the vpn connection cant actually be establishedwhen you add to all of this a remarkably clunky web management interface the linksys befvp is a nonstarter for me
both units are on their way back to amazoncom as i write this review
after a previous experience with the company where they took forever to update drivers to fix a compatibility issue after seeing technically inaccurate tech notes on their support web site and after addingin this experience ill think twice before bothering with anything linksys againmy chosen replacement for the befvp a pair of cyberguardsnapgear sg units have already arrived and have proven themselves to be far more flexible more configurable and more powerful than the befvp
along with their configurability the sgs provide pptp and ltp support directly in addition to ipsec making a total solution that unlike the befvp truly doesnt require special software clients to offer a total officetooffice and mobiletooffice network solutionfunctionality is good but quality or quality control is very poor
headphones were very poor had bad tonal quality and one buzzed irritatingly w resonances
tone quality was good with quality headphones
player exhibited extremely high noise levels while playing cdda disks and right channel quotchirpingquot noise during mp playback
battery life seemed poor although no quantitive measure was made
if you purchase this player test it carefully before you throw away the packagingim not very impressed with this product for a number of reasons
for starters the base seems to be too brittle and i had trouble with the leader snapping off in the takeup spool
secondly the shadow detail was lacking
i know that this is a judgement call but that what i found in looking at my slides
finally i really have to wonder whether provia delivers the full rated speed
i think it might be best to overexpose it by about a halfstop
i shot it in a couple different cameras and the results were disappointing in this regard
never had these issues with kodak ektachrome but thats gone now and fujichrome is about the only game in townfirst let me say that this is an excellent film
my problem is with unknown storage conditions
this film has a two year shelf life and fuji recommends refrigerated storate even for short term
the roll i received was fourteen months old and i have no idea of how or where its been stored
also a problem with packaging
this was received in one of amazons new packing methods which consists of a piece of folded cardboard
the film carton was crushed but the film cannister apparently protected the roll itself
i tried this for the convenience since no one in my part of town sells mm film but i had to pass on this one and returned it
itll be a crosstown trip for me to a pro shop that has fresh stock and refrigerated storagerayovac has a one hour charger with  independeent charge circuits can cahrge unqually used batteries or uneven capacities without overunder charging some of them for the same price as this w batteries
gp has mah batteries
these batteriees are mah
acessories that ive had interest in that has olympus brand is  more expensive than generic brands of the same quality
olympus has great cameras
buy the accesories from another brand cheapeer higher quality
oh yeah this is a dumb charger also
that means batteries get overcharged and that substantially reduces their life
you can buy rapid  hrs charge time dumb chargers for this dvd recorder does not record on x discs which are becoming standard media
i even downloaded and ran the firmware upgrade which promised compatibilityi contacted customer service and they are absolutely useless
as mentioned in many other reviews the agents dont speak english very well
it took several tries for the agent to be able to record my simple phone numberif you do chose to buy this product because of its price then be sure to stock up on slow x discsunless you have a lot of money  and want to go ahead and get it i would recommend holding off on this unit
i have tested it and returned it because of several things that are wrong with it but could easily be fixed in future generationsif you just want to record from cableuhfvhf then you shouldnt be disappointed with this model
i found no problems with recording from cable or in its audio and video quality
however copying from vhs input the main selling point for me on dvrs is where i started to dislike this uniton vhs input it suffers from signal drop skipping over dropped out audio and video
if the vhs tape was damaged then i could understand as its a tracking problem
but this happens in certain specific areas of certain tapes but never exactly in the same spots just the generalized area
plus i tested two different vhs inputs a philips dvdvcr combo and a go video vhs
there was still signal drop from the go but this just amazed me there was more signal drop from the philips
the input and output sources were devices from the same company yet the results were worsealso be aware that this unit while it will play some dvd recordable formats it doesnt write to it wont play pressed dvdrom eg
the dvd movies you buy in a store
the video keeps skipping with no audio
also dvdr the write onceread many worm dvd disc format is only just now coming out and the entire dvd format is more expensive than the traditional dvd format used in most other recorders
the dvd format was made to capitalize on a market without standards yet so dont be pulled into itif you just want a cable signal recorder then if you can spare the money this unit is a good choice
id wait until they work out the bugs in it though before buying it myselfpurchased this item due to some compatibility issues with my network card and my office
it does the job but there are no drivers for windows vista
basically that means either constantly plugging and unplugging ny ethernet ord fom this to my ethernet lan on my comp or have two access points in use at all timesit doesthe job but would it hurt to have drivers for vistai purchased the adaptec aua duoconnect card at my local retailer for use with my quicksilver model power mac g dual ghz
my builtin ports had gone flakey so i wanted a quality pci expansion card to replace their functionality
adaptec used to make some of the fastest scsi cards around so i decided to give their product a try
i picked the duoconnect so i could get some usb  ports while i was at itwell its very fast  when copying between internal and external devices it is faster than apples builtin firewire was
unfortunately it has problems  of the crashing sort
when a firewire device is connected and the mac is put to sleep it doesnt make it to deep sleep mode fans keep running and wakes up again
this happened with both a buspowered ipod and a selfpowered lacie d drive
the lacie showed truly strange behavior of spinning down then up then down six times in a row before finally stopping
the only way out is to turn the mac off
i contacted adaptec tech support via their web pageafter a brief of confusion in which they thought i was using usb devices adaptec support tested the configuration themselves confirmed the problem and suggested that i either disable sleep mode or return the card to the retailer from which i purchased it
following are their own wordsin our unofficial testing of the firewire  and duoconnect aua and aua it seems that the controller itself is compatible with deep sleep
yet as soon as any devices are attached to either the usb or firewire ports the system will not be able to recover from the deep sleep functionit appears that this issue is due more to the pci bus itself rather than to the duoconnect adapter
when deep sleep is initiated the pci bus and attached peripherals will be powered down
yet because the pci controller is not directly powered from the motherboard there is no way to send a signal to the attached devices to wake them
this means that a signal can be sent to the attached devices to put them into a power down status but no signal can be sent to revive them from that state
for that reason the firewire and duoconnect card is not fully compliant with apples deep sleepwhat you may want to do at this point is to open up the energy saver control panel and set the power settings to never to disable sleep
yet if this is not an option then unfortunately there is no workaround for this issue and you may want to return the controller to the place of purchase for a refundwe apologize for the delay in getting this information to you
it did take some time to replicate the issue and search for a possible solution
we hope that you understand
so in summary very fast firewire usb  card but useless if your power mac ever sleeps
adaptecs tech support was prompt and didnt send me form letter style replies so props for that
ill try adaptec again in the future due to their support team its also why i give this card  stars instead of just  but ill always beware and make sure there is a good return policy just in casethis doesnt work so hot if you have a wireless network cardevery time that anything accesses the usb port it causes somuch interference that it drops the wireless network connectionplus the supporting software is really pretty buggyim bringing this one back to the storethis card is fine for what it is but it is basically useless for many highspeed applications
if you want usb  its probably to feed a thumb disk or a hard drive or a video adaptorall of which will need the usb port to feed powerwhich this card does not
unless you plug in the optional power supply
which is not available off the shelf in most stores
sure i was able to fashion one myself but why should i have to
this cent omission on adaptecs side is a  problem on top of the purchase pricei own a xx ext usb  iomega burner for my notebook and so thought i would get a usb  pcmcia card for it
well to make a long story short i simply couldnt get it to completely install
i downloaded the most recent drivers from adaptec followed all their instructions on the website etc etc
no go for burning
i was able to get it to read from the external drive so it wasnt a total wasteupon looking at several other reviews i have discovered that many people have had similiar problems with this card although i have seen one person mention that the win xp sp contained drivers for the card itself i still was unable to get results from it
i tried it on win oss  xp home and xp pro with and without the most recent sps from microsoft and with older and newer drivers btw
however one interesting thing i have come across from a few reviewers is its surprisingly efficient compatibility with linux
one review that came to mind mentioned red hat  as the one he found it working withfor those of us who are stuck supporting themselves by using windows based programs though mostly page layout this may be interesting but not really helpful practically
 i am going to keep the card in the hopes that adaptec will release a driver that works in the future though as i know that this company usually makes excellent products
in the meantime i bought another usb  pcmcia card from orangemicroi really wanted to give this one star but thats not really fair to the board which works fine
the videowave software is extremely limited and doesnt even allow you do do much of what is in the manual
for instance there are modules to allow adjustment of color and brightness but they are disabled
so all you can do is look at them
customer service requires an id number which is not provided with this version
so the only way you can get help is to pay for phone support
im so turned off by this i will likely avoid all roxio software in the futurebottom line buy the board if that is what you want but dont even think about using the softwarecons the price is dropping on this thing weekly
im using it on an brandspankingnew thinkpad under xp and recording is a buggy disaster among other things
creativelabs hasnt been timely in their responses to bug reports so its unclear if the hw is broken or not
even if its not untimely response to real support requests isnt encouraging
im actually trying to use the product for real things
the software bundle is definitely light for the current price notably lack of a dvd playerpros there are many high end products which use usb
yes i would love it if they all used firewire but precious few seem to
 is real and extigys price is cheap compared to certain other offerings unfortunately there may be a real reason why the price is less  see aboveover time extigy might be a real contenderthe first point i would like to make is that amazon is currently selling this for  with  shipping cost
my local best buy stocks these for  and throw in ca sales tax and you are still come in  cheaper than amazon and youll have them today
also i found out klipschs own website offers these for  and free shipping
anyway ignoring the fact that the design reminds me of windows days i bought them locally and plugged them in only to realize i had a dead unit
i can definitely agree with what the other reviews say about shoddy buildquality
the wiring is definitely garbage
also there seem to be two versions of this speaker one has a replaceable fuse and onoff switch and the other doesnt
see photoshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomermediaproductgallerybvuorefcmciupdpimagesallthey sounded great in the store but i cant justify spending over  on something that will break so easily
im trying to replace my yearold harmankardon  system
i dont like stuff that breaks
thinking about it more my hk speakers have a much better design both ergonomically and aesthetically
too bad they discontinued that modeli guess from here ill try the companion  series ii or zsi purchased a new set of promedia  speakers to replace a set that failed power supply blows fuses after about years of service
tried contacting klipsch customer service but there was no reply to my inquiry im not new to the klipsch brand
i have  pair of heritage speakers  lascalas front channel and heresys back channel  both from the s
not to mention a pair of kg s and klipsch image one headphonesthere are significant differences between the old promedia v and the new promedia v
the specs on the klipsch website  continue to reflect the v system
specs for the v seem to be hard to come by
most online reviews just regurgitate the klipsch website specsthe v manual that came with the system states the subwoofer is rear port and frontfiring  longthrow driver but the system incorporates the same  sidefiring front port design as the v
the subwoofer cabinet couldnt physically accommodate an  driverevery corner that could be cut has been cut in the v right down to the length of the power cord
there is no power switch no external fuse the satellites are hard wired where the use to have miniplugs
the v subwoofer enclosure weighs a full  lbs
less than the v  lbs vs  lbswhile i can not make a direct comparison between the  systems my subjective evaluation is that the v is pretty gutless compared to the old v
the bass is just not there like it was in the v
i think it is safe to say that it is no longer a watt total system
im not completely dissatisfied with the v system but more disappointed in the poor quality from a name i thought i could trustthis is a disposable system
dont expect to last a life time as you would most speaker systems
its just not built to last  its built to failive gotten much more service from cambridge soundworks systems
when this promedia system fails and im sure it will from what i read im replacing it with a cambridge system
probably should have sent these back and purchased a microworks or model  systemklipsch promedia  thx certified computer speaker system blacki have had two sets of these marvelous sounding speakers and both have failed
they feature outstanding lows mids and highs for about the best channel pc sound ive heardunfortunately they do not hold up
my first set developed a buzz after several weeks
i exchanged them for another set because i loved the sound so much
after about  years my second set has failed
the left or right speaker would continually cut in and out forcing me to fiddle with the wires and the connector to the subwoofer
finally today i was happily listening to itunes when all of a sudden the speakers began to buzz and pop until the sound cut out and the little green power light faded out never to relight again
very very disappointingi loved these speakers for nearly  years
then the din cable that goes from the control pod right speaker with controls to the subwoofer stopped working
search the internet its a common problem after youve had them for a while
dont buy these if you want them to work for more than a few yearsbought a set of these about  years ago
used them for a couple years and absolutely loved them until one day the weird plug bent and the amp fried
immediately ran out and bought another set but later found out they had changed the design slightly
no problem
about a year later the amp fried
got a great deal on another set and that amp fried about  months later
manufacturer support is nonexistent
hope you have better luck than iwith minimal use i am talking about  hours of use during a  year time period the subwoofer malfunctioned
i did expect to get more quality and use out of these speakersive had these speakers for about  years
the small unit that controls the volume and bass shown on the left in the picture has had to be replaced  times due to hardware failure
klipsch sent me a replacement the first time but i had to buy my own twice after the warranty expired
when the system is working it works very well
rich sound clear highs and lows
however my speakers have finally started to distort again and i cant handle buying another  parti picked up a set of these from best buy tonight
my  year old altec lansing speakers are starting to let go
got them home and plugged it in
the sound was great
nice and crisp with deep thumping bass
the bass is adjustable unlike my old speakers
i set the bass about halfway and turned the speakers up to about  percent small room dont need a lot of sound
after about five minutes the sub started making a squealing noise and a burning smell
now no sound is coming out of them at all
theyre already back in the box and back to bb tomorrow
now im not sure what speakers to try next
tempted by the bose but theyre way too expensive
my wife has logitech speakers but ive never liked the sound that comes out of themmy advice is to use the heck out of them for the  days that you get
if they last to that point theyll probably last a long time
these speakers are rated very well which is why i bought them
i just wish that they lived up to the rating that they gotmy buddy bought this set for outdoor tailgates since he got sick of lugging his minisystem around which was far from mini and since we were to use this outside he needed something powerful so he choose the klipsch
now i understand that  percent of the people are using these indoors and of course probely dont turn the volume all the way up but since we have a huge area to cover we usally have it just a little below full volume
first off they sound pretty good at about mid volume
even still we both have to use the eqs on our mp players if i run mine at normal sound or he runs his through the line out jack with no eq there is an unbelievable distortion coming from the high end its just to darm bright and harsh and there is also a distortion in the midrange
the bass is tight and doesnt seem to break up
as we get higher in volume these things just have way to much distortion
maybe it better inside but even still they really shouldnt be so tinny high end or flat midrange
i can understand some volume loss outside and even some sound imperfection soundstaging but harsh distortion
i have a pair of  creatives
even they are only watts they are pretty loud and i have run these outside with no problems
no sound break up clean as a whistle
we have tried everything to clean these klipschs up
top end mm cables creatives upconvert and eqs
point blank they sound great but no more then half way up or these suckers are breaking up
whats the point of high wattage if you cant use the other half
i think these are overrated
try something else or step down with power and get a pair of creative just dont get the sets that dont have a seperate bass control they are way to bass heavyi was thrilled when i first installed my dip last summer
internet connection sharing is a breeze and the print server was a great feature
i soon found however that windows   and xp would often fail when trying to print to either of my canon printers bjc and s using the print server
i had to reconfigure windows to print directly to the printer which causes the program doing the printing to hang until the printing is complete
even at this setting the print job will often fail requiring a reboot of the pc
i have better luck when i cycle the power on the printer just before sending the print job but that really shouldnt be necessarythe firewall has recently began to give me problems following a firmware update to version   i use lotus notes and an ibm as client emulator to access my companys vpn from home
both programs worked flawlessly through the dip until recently
now i have to physically bypass the router by replugging ethernet cables to get onto the vpn
i tried to configure the dmz which supposedly bypasses the firewall for one computer but found that when i set a static ip address for the computer as required by dmz i was unable to access the internet
firewall settings are very spartan and some seem to be completely ineffective even after several reboots of the firewall and all client pcs
overall the management software for the dip is severely lackingtechnical support is limited almost nonexistant but thats par for the course these days
their web site offers firmware downloads and a faq section which is very sparse on meaningful informationive set up several smc and netgear routers for my clients and currently plan to replace this di with an smc smcbr cabledsl router with  port switch amazon has a great price
my recommendation
bah  skip this product and look for comparable products from smc or netgearim always worrying whether or not this dvd player will play a dvd consistently
sometimes it plays it and sometimes it doesnt
if a dvd player cant do its basic function play dvds and do it well then whats the point
you might as well pay an extra  and get a dvd player that will play dvds consistently without skippingthis is definetly not worth the hasslea few years ago i bought a full room of jbl speakers from center to subwoofer
all worked perfectly for few yearsi am not the daily users of the system but once a week at most until one day i heard disturbing noise from the subwoofer even before i turned on the receiver
i readjusted the receiver and the subwoofer as well as replaced the connection cable but all did not help
now i have to find a different one for replacement
this time i will not do with jblim a huge huge fan of the rio product line
i owned  rio s  rio s and  rio volts  these are all wildly fantastic products
i also own a rio replaytv system  another unbelievably great product
my wife bought me the rio riot for our anniversary from amazoncom and its the first rio product that really isnt up to par
im already a big mp music fan so i have both itunes and realjukebox installed
you cannot use the rio riot with an existing copy of realjukebox
i verified this with rio tech support
the rio riot simply did not show up under itunes no matter how many times i installed and used different usb cables
this definitely wont be my last rio product but im no longer going to buy their products so confidently
if you are a realy mp fan you can trust my advice to pass over this onei own a rio riot and it is fine for what it does
but in order to get music over to the rio riot you have to use software from quotrealquot  and they put up an unending stream of popup advertising
im afraid to say that if i had known how abusive the software was i would have gotten another brand of mp playeri thought like other people that this would be a good ipod substitue
i mean a direct usb connection is all i ask for
none of the firewire cards that you have to buy in addition with the player
however i was quite disappointed when i actually started to use the archos
mine came with preinstalled songs and looked like it was partially opened
after my initial connection to transfer mps the jukebox started to sporadically change to a different song
strange enough the song it changed to during other tracks wasnt even on the jukeboxanother thing that was deceptive is that i thought it was pocket sized but it can only fit in pockets that are extremely oversized to begin with
there is also an incompatibility with windows xp and the software on their website isnt that much betternot to mention the jukebox constantly freezes up under very little effort
it is extremely sensitive
i think the person that used theirs as a door stop was a more functional use
i will probably call archos customer support but i dont have a lot of time to wait on hold
i hope someone comes up with a cheaper more functional windows type of ipod but this just isnt itthis is an ave product
i had this for  months and the thing stopped working
so i mail it to archos the tech support was quite helpful  and they mail me a new one
i then left for bombay india where in about  days it broke down again
of course expectedly archos did not have a service center in india  they asked me to mail it to taiwan
so i called archos when i got back to the us
they asked me the serial number  only the replacement one they sent did not have one
so after much headache they finally asked me to ship it and shipped me a new one
i had mailed them the usb cable which they did not bother mailing back
it is a way cable  not available easily
they sent me a cable promptly
the third one too broke down and i did not bother to send it to themthe sound quality is good
the headphones they send are really pathetic
to be fair to archos their customer support wasnt bad at all  and they were helpful
but the product itself is bulky  the one i had had an  mb buffer which i thought would be good enough while jogging
i was dead wrong
the thing would freeze and skip often and i had to go back to my sony gprotection cd walkman
if i had not repeatledly used it whilst jogging  there probably wouldnt be a problem
the thing is also kind of heavy  it is as heavy as a small stone
but my friend has it  and he uses it mainly in the car through the cassette player and sometimes on campus  and he is quite happy with itin the end if you are looking for a cheap hd player and are basically a couch potato then this player will not disappoint you else i highly recommend that you give it a pass
i now intend to buy the rio nitrus  it does look like a good productive always thought monster products were snake oil now im sureid been reading about the value of isolating the incoming power for digital and analog components in high end audio
with around k in my audio system i thought this would be a relatively cheap experiment  and at the very least good surge protectionwrongfirst i could seehear no difference with everything plugged into it
nothing
even the faint hz hum one of my subwoofer amps produces was still there
so much for conditioning powermore important the first and only time i powered it up remotely from my preamp using the correct trigger ports my power amps right channel fried
that amp has always been remotely powered up through the preamp trigger before without any problemsi dont know how good this thing is at stopping surges but its awesome at creating them
maybe my amp picked that one time to be defective but i dont think so
and it had to be replaced not just a fuseheres a positive note this thing has a nice case looks really impressive in the rackeven with nothing plugged into itthere is a reason why this item is so heavily discounted and it is so because this is not a wellthought welldesigned productlike most power strips these days monsters product offers some decent surge protection on both plugged in devices and on coax youll have that if you get cable or satellite tv
to differentiate it from the competition the monster designer have colored theirs a shade of purple and have labeled the  outlets with multicolored not very useful but harmless plastic tags such as vcr really
 cd receiver catv and so forth
there is also a master onoff button that shines a blue light when onso far so good but then there is an inexcusable design flaw
this works well for as long as you are using  or prong plugs
whether they are for the vcr the cd or your catv they fit well on this units side
the trouble comes when you try to plug in just about any addc adapter because this units design does not allow it or makes it extremely difficult and inconvenient
this is bad
in addition the provided patch coax cable is short enough to make it useless  of course you can get something of a more useful length at the store but why bother to include one if its only  ft longto summarize you get surge protection for up to  devices if they are all using  or prong plugs and coax if a ft long patch cable is long enough
the labels are largely useless because they are somewhat obsolete vcr cd but they dont hurt
the blue light emitted by the on button can serve as a night lighti am okay with my purchase because i acquired mine as an amazons lightning deal deep discount but you can probably get better from a more established power surge equipment vendor even at the currently advertised pricei purchased this type because it was cheaper than the same brand and gauge without the clear plastic outer sleeve
big mistake
spent hours it seems just stripping both ends of five pieces running to my speakers
tried several different tools and part of the difficult is the wires within are interwoven so you had to be careful not to cut through one of them while cutting through the outsidefirst i have to start off by saying that this cd player has the most features in any portable cd player i have ever seen
you have limited control over treblebass but the majority of portable cd players give you no control over your sound except for some stupid bass function
the remote is extremely useful
it displays all of your id tag info on a nice line display
one of my favorite parts is that the remote is backlit which i find very useful for listening to the cd player at night
one of my other favorite features is that you can upgrade the filmware
i have only touched on the features that were important to me because if i was to go though everything wed be hear all dayso we have a great sounding feature rich and extremely slim cd player
sounds like a good review so far but i am convinced that rioiriver cant make a sturdy cd player
i used to have a rio sp that i loved
i dropped that and it broke
i take full responsibility for that
but my slim iriver stopped working for no apparent reason
i have had the disc player for  months now and it will not work unless i hit it real hard to get the laser to move
reading a lot of other peoples complaints it seems like this happens way to often
a portable cd player needs to take a little abuse here and there
it cant just stop working for no apparent reason
and fortunately for me my service plan ran out  days ago so i cant do much
i could go through the manufacture and try and get it fixed but i cant be without a cd player for that long
i use this for  hours and work my car and home
i really find it hard to live without a mp cd player
so i went out and picked up a sony atari player
its the  version and thus far i am happy
sounds good and the menu structure works well enough
i wish it was backlit and i could control treblebass
but those are my only complaints so far
i would not recommend getting an iriver disc player unless you get it form somewhere like a best buy where you can get an extended warranty
i say stay away but it might be worth the chanceafter  months of use it proves itself to be not as promised
the biggest problem i have is the skipping
i cannot even carry it on my school bag not to mention carring it while jogging
another thing is the battery  hours and its dead
i constantly need to recharge it
i would definitely choose another brand like sony with standard aa battery instead of this one
i recently bought creative labs normad iic because it is light and small and use internal memory so it wont skip which is ideal for jogging
but the player froze a couple of times and it feels cheap i returned it and got this cdmp player which is originally what i want
now i dont need to transfer filesit plays all the mp discs i burned and even some asf format files not to mention the conventional cds
it can display the mp tag and use winamps play list
its also programmable you choose the songs in the order you want them to play
the cd console feels solid and compact
the remote control is a cool little device and have a tons of functions
besides playing discs there are two very useful features among many others fm tuner and timerthe thing i dont like is the rectangle rechargable batteries because they are hard to find and expensive to buy upgrading firmware is easy if you know how to burn cds
i recently bought sennheiser hd for my slimx imp
actually i found out that the earbuds with the player is not badwhen reading complains about the batteries and no lcd on the main player you should know that thats part of the slim design
if you dont care about how thick the player is and want to use regular batteries go and buy iriver chromex imp which has the basic functions as slimx imp
however i do think they should keep most of the functions on the main player
the functions have been limited again in the new slimx imp which i dont likeso far i am very happy with it and give it a  starim only commenting on the audio quality of the player because after i discovered that the volume just wasnt loud enough i didnt bother investigating the other features
i received the slimx yesterday and am returning it today
at the highest volume setting it would be adequate if you were sitting still in a perfectly noiseless environment and even then the volume would certainly not be considered deafening but thats not the situation in which i would normally use it
the earbuds as everyone else comments on are pretty much worthless but i tried the player with two other sets of headphones and still wasnt satisfied
even with a set of koss over the ear headphones i could still hear people around me talking with the volume turned up fullim sure its a fine product ive been buying from amazon for years and base most of my purchases on customer comments as i did with the slimx and is definitely eyecatching with its techno good looks but this isnt the mp player for mei bought two of these one as a gift and one for myself
the sound quality is ok but no better
theres aliasing of high notes when playing mps
the user interface is all through a  inch by half inch low contrast lcd display and the type face is difficult to read in low light and the controls are a set of multifunction switches
you need to read the display because some of the modes and functions are critical and the method for invoking them isnt obvious
it took me a lot of false starts before i got it out of the mode where every song got repeated indefinitely unless you manually advance the play list
you also need to control the battery charging mode
just plugging the damn thing in and leaving it for  hours will result innothingi bought this as my first digital camera five months ago largely on the strength of the amazon reviews
i intended to use it for routine snapshots
i cant state how well it stacks up against other digital cameras of which i know nothing
but i can say i was surprised by deficiencies it has when compared against my  olympus mm film camerafirst the indoor exposure quality is pretty poor
its sensitivity reminds me of asa  speed film
a flash is always required indoors
the flash is quite anemic anything  feet or more away will be dark
in photographing a kids soccer team two rows deep the front row was slightly overexposed while the rear was underexposed
the line was about  feet deep total
there is very little exposure latitude with the flashsecond i have never seen such red eye in my life
the flash is about  from the lens in the same horizontal plane
i have to spend a couple minutes in photoshop to clean up every single shot
im used to seeing eyes like this on flash photos of cats not humansthird the battery is tiny proprietary and very expensive
this probably explains the weak flash  theres very little power and nikon needs to preserve it
plus after about  seconds idle time the camera hibernates to save the battery
one has to press the shutter and wait about  seconds for it to revive each timefourth while outdoor exposure has been good the led screen is too weakly backlit to view at the beach or ski slope
and theres no optical viewfinder so you often cant see what youre photographing in these circumstancesfifth one must swivel the lens assembly open in order to use the camera
when doing this its very easy to put a fingerprint over the fixed transparent lens cover
and a little bit of smudge on that cover gives plenty of artifact on the picturesfinally while i shoot at the units maximum resolution its still not acceptable to press the shutter button and wait two seconds before it takes the shot  and then wait another  or  seconds for it to be ready for the next
and if the flash is involved that adds another  seconds before the picture is taken
like i said i was looking for family snapshots but far too many pictures have the subject moved out of the frame because of these delaysso this camera is okay for some things  especially outdoor daylight shots that are not too bright
but my mm performs a lot better in many circumstances
and its costcodeveloped pictures are about  the cost of those from a digital camera
and i dont have to spend hours engineering photoshop corrections or burning the images to archival cdif i had it to do over again id be more fussy about cycle time battery capacity flash distance from lens and exposure latitude
live and learnthough adequate as a replacement for an aps pocket pointandshoot this camera has several drawbacks that should give pausethe tooclever signature coolpix twist to expose the lens takes just that much longer and is just that much more fiddly than simply removing a lens capand one misses too many photos as a result
a sliding cover would have served much better especially one that also turns the camera on
the twist doesnt turn the camera on thats a distinct step
controls menus and features are generally good as is the lcd but the power switch is easy to leave in the wrong state and is poorly constructedsadly the real failing of this camera is its image quality
maybe im comparing apples to oranges but when i bought this as an easier to carry substitute for my olympus cz i was prepared to loose some quality for the sake of convenience
however i was not prepared for the glaring failings i encountered
first off nikon compresses its highest quality images more than is necessary
far worse are the strange washedout or saturated colors i get with this camera
in side by side comparisons between my two digital cameras where the olympus produces striking results the nikons are consistently oversaturated and blurry
i have taken both cameras on several trips and find myself discarding almost every shot taken with the nikon even when i have no equivalent from my olympusoverall a convenience not worth the disappointmentsorry to say this purchase of  years ago wasnt worth it
i tried it and it just didnt meet my needsbeware
you get what you pay for
i didnt even bother asking for it to be returned for i still use it and i dont even know why
i should just toss it
i give it a two stars vs one because i use it
whats wrong with it
it sags it loses its velcro grip everytime i go through a speed bump or when god forbit i go off roading in my subaru
id say pass for potential buyers and go with a more stirdy pieceheres the reasons why i call this a  plastic junk
the  mp doesnt give enough picture quality
mp is just a marketing thing its actual quality is more like mp
visible purple fringing chromatic aberrations
lcd monitor is not good tough to see anything on in sunlight
using a cheapish lcd helps drive profit margins higher for kodak on this
unacceptable time lag when veiewing on lcd
takes more than  secs to write anything on the cf card
even my last years fuji was much better than this 
poor viewing capabilites
you need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock
why doesnt kodak sell it along with camera itself 
after all it hardly worth  bucks 
missing features like movieaudio video out atleast some manual controls etc
or atleast a x optical zoomi have compared this camera to other canonsony ones and find this way below on qualityfeatures compared to them
i see that many people here have a  star review for this but then maybe its their first experience with a digicamkodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras
buy a canon s or s or a and you will be much more happy
they have much more features and have very good metallic bodies
dont buy this plastic junk
look all the freebies that kodak is throwing in to sell this i know i will not be very pouplar in my harsh review about this cheapie but i prefer to be candidfirst off this isnt that bad of a machine
however it had some annoying features that caused me to return it
i would really rate this between  and  stars but since you only get whole stars i went  on it
but that  is just because of what i found wrong with this machine as far as what i wanted from itfirst off the picture is not that bad
also playback is not noisy and the picture and sound is pretty good
having audio inputs on the front is great
also the programmeable timer options are greatbut i had some problems with this machine
two of them are not fixeable due to the design
the other might be due to a bad machine but im not sure
however the first two points i cover are the reasons why i returned this unit and gave it a  star ratingreason  why this machine went back  in order for the timer recording to work you have to press a timer button on the remote
hello
this is not the s
yes that is what the old vcrs did but in this day and age you normally just program the time you want to record and then turn the vcr off
it wouldnt be so bad with the timer button if it were on the machine as well but you have to do it from the remote
if you lose the remote youre out of luck
this alone was the major deciding factor in why i returned this unit
plus since my wife is the primary user of this machine she found that to be annoying
she doesnt want to have to hunt for the quototherquot remote just to turn off the machine and put it back into timer mode
you see i have it set up to record her yampr on a daily basis
if we stayed with this machine and she just hit the power button on the remote as she has done for  years on our previous vcr the timer would never kick off and record the show for the next day
oh boy
if that happened i would never hear the end of it
reason   the remote only works with jvc tvs
you cannot program it to work with other tvs
on top of that i could not for the life of me get this vcr to work with my universal remote that i already own
i use that remote for my tv the cable box as well as the old vcr
now i normally probably wouldnt care too much about this but since my wife is the main user of this vcr she does care about it
she doesnt like having to hunt for multiple remotesreason   this didnt necessarily cause me to return it but it is an annoyance and possibly it was due to a faulty machine
but reasons  and  had already made me decide to return it but i wanted to let people know about this possible problem
the autotracking is very slow and some tapes that i have that i know work fine in hifi mode apparently could not be adjusted to stop noisy playback
the tracking seemed off and the hifi sound was awful for some tapes
playing them in another machine resulted in clear playback
also it seemed at the beginning of a recording the picture was bad for about  seconds as if the tracking were off and then it finally fixed itself
this is kind of annoying if you cant see the beginning of your recording
normally when i program the timer i give myself  minutes before and after the programs time
however there are times when something comes on that i want to see and i have to hit the record button right there
with this machine i would possibly have to sit through  seconds of snowy picture before it clears up
this seemed to happen time and time again as i tested the recording function
again this might be due to a faulty machine
i even ran a head cleaner through the machine and that didnt helphowever if annoyances  and  mean nothing to you then this machine is not that bad of a buy
some stated it ate tapes as soon as they got it home
others have stated noisy playback from the machine itself
i experienced no such problems but of course i only had the machine for  night and exchanged it for a panasonic which doesnt require you to hit a timer button and its remote could control my tv and my universal remote can be programmed to control the panasonic vcri guess the best bet is to try it out for yourself
i myself didnt like some of the quotfeaturesquot it had and returned it promptlythis is a good camera if you are going to be shooting in daylight and if youre good at figuring out electronics
it is not intuitive to use and i have to explain to friends how to turn on the display screen or review a picture everytime
once you know its not terrible but there are other problems
the display doesnt come on when you turn the camera on  you have to turn it on yourself
of course you dont need it on  you can never turn it on and shoot everything as if it was a normal camera  then just look at the pictures on your computer
however most of us like to play with these a little more and show our friends pictures right after we take them
this just makes it a little more difficult to do that
this should not be a deal breaker thoughive had substantial trouble with indoor photography however
if you think the flash issue that everyone talks about wont be an issue for you think again
youll take this to one wedding and miss every shot you want
on top of that most of the pictures will come out dark and out of focus
basically indoor pictures are just out
but outdoor it works finethe part i was happiest with was the software that came with it
the program to download and edit your photos was oppositely extremely intuitive and easy to use
i wish the camera had been designed the same wayall in all the problem with indoor photograhy is a deal breaker
its otherwise so small and easy to point and click not using the lcd that its too bad it comes with these other problemsergonomically and constructionwise its solid but the preference panel is useless on  because every time you launch it you have to quit the preferences so it can be relaunched in bit mode
to give you an idea of how much effort they put into their os x preference software it hasnt been updated since  the panel that shipped with the mouse from  seriously why bother including it
i had to go to your web site to get the updated version
is it really that hard to update your simple preferences app once every year or so kensington
as an alternative using the builtin mouse panel in os x doesnt seem to have any effect on this mouse but will try again with kensington software uninstalledanother downer this mouse tracks very poorly on dark surfaces
i have a black laminate desktop with some grain  texture to it and my old apple optical mouse did just fine on this surface
with this mouse every minute or so it stops detecting the surface and just freezes so i have to pick it up and place it on a white piece of paper to get it to work again
will probably be sending this back for that reason
theres no excuse for something like that with current techi have had this mouse for about  months with considerable use in fps gaming
this mouse has a problem with lag between the time one clicks the left or right button and the actual action to take place on the screen
not good for high action shooter games when instant response is essential
i have also found that the left and right buttons malfunction or stop working sporadically for no apparent reason
thus my rating of two starsi was looking for a  button mouse to replace my old one
its fine as a mouse but the  buttons on either side are way too easy to hit accidentally
if you cup the mouse sort of like you are holding a baseball you wont hit those buttons but who uses a mouse like that
most folks sort of reach for the mouse and put their hand on top of the mouse and thats where you start hitting the side buttons
my old mouse put the buttons closer to the frontdid i say cheapyou get less than what you paid for this camcorderi bought it because it was going to cost  after rebate
now i know why it is so cheapthis thing is nothing more than a fancy webcam with firewire and usb connections that records on dv tapesbelieve me all you get is webcam quality capture on dv tapesthe native resolution of the capture i bet is  x  which is the same as vcd
you will not get dvd quality capture  x  with this camcorderi have adobe premiere  and used it to do live capture
this is how you see the full capability of the camcorder capture
if you record on tape the manufacturer could say or you might believe that the issue is with the tape
so doing live capture to your computer hard drive is the best way to test the camcorderi did a series of capture  and  widescreen at dv settings of  x  the movies were awful as if i was using a netcam
in fact this camcorder only takes slightly better picture than my netcamthis camcorder is meant for capturing movies for tv since most tvs display at  x 
it is not meant for high resolution capture
the movies looked barely ok on my tv but just awful on my computers when viewed at full screen
the movies looked ok if viewed in a small window on the computer just like they do on the tv
however when you maximize the movies to full screen you realize that they were captured at low resolutionsi spend two hours going through the settings and manual thinking that the camera was set for low resolution movie capture and that i could change it
that was not the case
for one you have no option to change the resolution at which movies are captured
two the resolution you get is the camcorders native and maximum resolutionthe still picture of this camecorder as you might expect by now is just as awful
the maximum resolution for the pictures is  x  just about like the movie capture resolutionfinally the camera is cheaply constructedmy advice skip this piece of i gave it two stars because it was cheap otherwise that would have been a zero starthe camera records good video images im very happy with that
the controls work fairly well though the menus take some getting used to
i like the two handed operation thought its easy for the right thumb to accidentally punch buttons that turn off the autofocus  the still images are very grainy but i dont use this camera for that very oftenthats the good heres the ugly i got this camera to download digital video into my pc through the onboard  connection
it simply doesnt work
i called sharp tech support we cant guarantee that the  interface will work with any other devices except another sharp camera
then why the hedoubletoothpicks doesnt the manual say that
why does their advertising trumpet the ability to download video to the computer
smacks of false advertising to me
reviewers updatewhile my annoyance at the attitude of sharps customer support is unabated i must sheepishly admit that the camera wasnt the problem with transferring video to the computer i was
i had incorrectly connected the  ports when i assembled my pc
once i fixed that video transfer worked excellentlyif it was possible for me to change my rating id now give it  stars
my thumb still pushes buttons i dont want it to push on occasion button placement is not idealeste juguete da un bajo profundo poderoso y definido mientras funciona
a los  meses de uso se me dantildeo me costo  usd repararlo espero que funcione mas tiempoi didnt even hook it up after i saw how big this thing is
will not fit in my girls tacoma
unless i put it in the back seat
negative on that
sent it back built a custom fiberglass inclosure behind her seat for two  kickers
if you have the room for this thing you have the room for something better
this is probably ok for some people i was just trying to give my girls truck a little boom for her birthday she has it nowlike many other reviewers say it sounds great
nice clean tight bass and the small size is a huge plus
unfortunately  hours after i hooked it up it completely cut out
no power
im pretty new to the world of car audio and besides the many positive reviews on sound one of the big reasons i bought it was for its simplistic set up
so the fact that it craps out on me when everything was properly connected leaves me at a complete loss
fuse is good reconnected it and still nothingone star for the frustration of now having to return it and an extra star for the fact that during that brief period of time my car actually had amazing sounding basswhen it works its great but its been nothing but problems
it wont shut off using the remote wire to head unit power led and servo light stays on while i have it on off not autoi get random spurts of bass from it while volume is down as if its getting power surges
sometimes the sub will kick on and just pound constantly reguardless if your head unit is turned up or down  i had to disconnect it to get it to stop
i allready got it wired properly through my vehicle and done feel like tearing out all the wires just to send it backbut i might stillsounded great but only lasted a year
i dont boom my music but i like it loud
i guess i was playing it too loud
i guess this would be good for moderate to low musicmaybe it would last longer
i will not buy againi ordered the sony pin to pin digital video cable for my sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors
i specifically ordered the sony rather than a generic one because i thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality
it was advertised as new
when i plugged it into my camcorder it did not work
on examining it i found that it had a bent pin
when i looked at the camcorder connection i found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder
what a bummer
i contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility  for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection
i did not bother to get another one for obvious reasonsworks as described
i am just so annoyed that sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive
its smart for sony to conduct business this way but only in order to earn profit in the short term
you can bet i wont be suckered in to buying any more sony products in the future now knowing that this is how they run their businessim using this on a winse pc to connect to an apple airport base station
it sees the base station fine but when the belkin is touching the base station it transmits at  signal strength
my powerbook can see the base station at  one floor up  on the second floor upbelkin software was easy to use and configure
maybe my hp pavilion causes a lot of rf interference
unknown but id try a linksys or hawking over the blekin
dont be swayed by the pricei presently have a canon x  stabilization binoculars and am very pleased
i ordered another one for our daughter
the image stabilization did not work
returned for a refundi bought this keyboard to replace my old ms natural which was  years old
i loved that keyboard
the keys had just the right feel and the quality was excellentunderstanding that it would be impossible to buy another keyboard built with that quality i went searchingi decided on the microsoft natural elite because of the reviews i read hereupdated review since i have now owned the microsoft natural keyboard elite for  months i think i have a better understanding of why some of the reviews for this product were negativesince my purchase on march  i have started coding java and doing a lot more writingthe spacebar has always been a problem
it sticks badly if it is hit on or near the edgesi am also having trouble with the shift keys
like the spacebar it sticks badly if you dont hit it just right
this applies to both the shift keys so its not a defect perse its a design flawi have had enough of this keyboard
i am going to look for a different one at a local retailer where i can try the keyboard before i buy it
right now im thinking a logitech
anything but another microsoft productafter  months i rate this keyboard unacceptable unless you dont use it much or have a very heavy hand
definitely not the keyboard for writers or codersms has changed the construction of the keyboard
the space bar does not work when hit on the right side
it is a major pia
reading other reviews the same appears to be true of all natural type ms keyboardsive been using split keyboards since  all microsofti could tell the current keyboard of  years was beginning to skip letters as i type  warning signalso i purchased a new one which has now moved to storage until i am simply forced to use it  keyboard clicks are sharp or tinny  i think due to the thin materials used for the housing  the keyboard speed is maddeningly slow
i have tried the new keyboard on both xp and win  set both oss at the highest speed and still the keyboard creeps until i want to throw it out the window
regular typing is ok but if you want to move the cursor to somewhere else on the page that has no keyboard shortcuts take a long deep breath
deleting whether forward or back is also annoyingly slowi have gone through two of these keyboards
i really like the comfort and design of this keyboard which is why i bought a second one when the first one started acting upi use the keyboard primarily for writing so i dont pay much attention to the other keys or their position although i think some of the keys are a little too smallmy first natural keyboard lasted about  months until one day it shorted and stopped typing the correct letters
i replaced it almost immediately with the same keyboard because of how much i liked the style and because i was so used to itmy new one which i bought in july shorted out after less than a teaspoon of coffe dripped on it
ive had keyboards that have survived major spillage cleaning products and being dropped yet this keyboard died after such a small injuryi have tried to contact microsoft to return it
its not worth a lot of aggravation but for  you would think it would be a little hardiernot recommendedi have been using microsoft ergonomic keyboards all the time
this one has got a little jinx in it
i wonder why are the arrow keys are placed so
the up and down keys are not placed back to back but up and down arrows are placed back to back
this causes a lot problem while using the arrow keys
they should have followed the normal standardsthis keyboard was great for  months then the letter b stopped working
the keyboard was not abused nothing was spilled on it and it was not banged on or mistreated
it worked well the night before then after sitting by itself undisturbed on the desk overnighti dont have children and my wife has her own computer i used it the next morning and the letter b was nonfunctional
tried everything and it would not work
if you think the price is fair for a good  months of use then this keyboard is for youi purchased this to replace my microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard 
dont waste your time spend the extra  and buy a far superior keyboard in the microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard this keyboard is functional but is all plastic and feels a little stiff when compared to the microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard 
i used this one for a couple months and finally switched backfirst off let me say that this is a pretty solid keyboard
no complaints about the qualityhowever be aware that microsoft decided to rearrange several clusters of keys on this keyboard
the arrow keys are in a diamond pattern rather than the traditional and imho efficient invertedt
also the homeendinsertdelpg uppg down cluster has been dissected and rearranged which causes me no end of grief and miskeysas a touchtypist and a programmer ive come to expect these keys to be in a certain position
i dont see any added value from microsofts updated positioning of these keys
however they definitely do ding my productivityyour milage may varyi was given one of these at work
while it does keep your wrists straight the keys are extremely soft touch
words often blur togheter and i have to spend extra time correcting them bevcause of this soft touch  especially the most important one  the space bar is so soft
i would never buy one on my own
not sure i am going to keep it may just turn it back inprossmall and compact
decent picture quality
very solid quality construction
feature laden camera
excellent software  documentation
looks great nice feelconszoom stinks
you need to walk forward ten feet to a quartermile to zoom this cameranotei use this camera as my second digital camera first is an olympus c  great for snapshots not for anything that requires any hint of a zoom
i love this cameraquick update  the picture quality of this camera is horrible
too many blurred andor out of focus pictures
had to sell off my s because it cant take sharpcrispclear pictures even in daylight 
many other users on dpreview forums have same problems  canon hasnt released any firmware update to fix it
my suggestion now is to avoid ssa because of focus problemsmy old review continues below canon has another winner in its new s model just like the s and sit has the following positives
excellent looksbuild quality
great night shots not found on any other compact  oz
camera new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto  secs tripod a must for this very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the world palntsc video out all cables included unlike sony accepts cheaper compact flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto mb
not expensive mb sticks here  very much pocketable
easily goes into any pocket
 mp may looks low compared to other  mp cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks 
dont just use mpixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera
if you wont print them bigger than x then mp should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash  also canon cant have a mp on the elphs since they have to sell their ss also 
x zoom very faster to start and fold back
works smoothly
you can turn the digital zoom off permanently
lcd is superb pictures look great on the  lcd
a bigger  lcd on other need not neccessarily mean better quality my last years fuji had  and comes no where near this  i havent encountered any problems downloading pics till now
i dont see any reason to buy a cf card reader the included cable works fine took just  mins for  big pictures
comparing this with s is really very tough
s is heavy and feels rock solid looks even better than s and has x zoom
s because of its light weight and smaller significantly smaller size is better to carry around
play with both in your local store before deciding between the two
great user interface think of these elphs as nokias of digicams
other cheaper cameras out there might not have same reliability features user interface and picture qualitythings that could be better
only x zoom canon needs to get this up to x next year
and x on ss replacement battery you might have to buy a second one for extra  bucks depending on your needs i guess this is the case with any ultra compact camera
the batterycf doors feel flimsy
canons zoombrowser ex software is very unstable
it has crashed atleast  times in one week on windows xp
also it takes long time to update its database whenever any pciture is deleted or addedd to the directory
canon needs to iron out the problems in this
you may be better off using some other sw for editingmanaging your pics use this one just for downloading pics
price is still high for a mp camera although its become much more affordable than last year
movie mode is almost useless because of  sec limit on decent sized clip
its just a marketing thing
included cf card is just mb 
someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent mb card along with new cameras
camera gets pretty hot in a few mins of use and the buttons on s feel tough to use compared to s
this is part of the deal in buying a such compact cameraspend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you wont regret 
getting a camera this compact has some compromises but well worth the ultra portability you getineffective at ft
a waste of moneyit worked really well for a month or two
so well that i bought a second one
the first one now has already died and now seeing that the item is discontinued by the manufacturer im guessing the second one isnt made to last either
too bad because its a great ideawhen i set this up it worked like a charm and i was very pleased with my purchase
when it stopped working as recommended by some reviewers i placed it inside a cozy birdhouse where it would be protected from the rain and wind
it worked a few times after that but then stopped working again altogether
it was great while it lasted and it is indeed a bargain for those people for whom it functions as intended but not for mei bought two sets of these sensors and installed one and kept the other as a backup
it worked fine for about  months and then the receiver just stopped working so i installed the backup set and it had the same problem after about  months the trademark  driveway patrol sold here on amazon is a much better set for just a few dollars morei installed brand new batteries and set the product up on my mantel for a test
i walked right up to it to within about feet and the alarm only sounded when i was directly in front of it
thirty degrees to the side and nothing waved my hand at it and not a peep
at least the vendor creditied my credit card for the purchase price minus shipping
lesson learned maybe i just got a lemon but in any case im not at all impressed with pir technology
in my experience it pir just does not seem to perform consistentlymine only works sometimes
i can go walk in front of it see the light blink but the sound doesnt go offthe sound on mine works about  of the timei have another model that works every time so if it wasnt such a hassle to return this one since it wasnt shipped by amazon i would have sent it backthe volume on this device has two settings loud and louder
it sounds like youre walking into a liquor store the dingdong sound
it doesnt come with a ac adapter and the volume is a bit loud
notably it doesnt work  of the time
i had kids running back and forth sometimes the alarm would go off sometimes it wouldnti originally wrote a positive review because it seemed that i was getting it set up in working order
i gave it some slack for being cheap against needing a lot of fiddling
i first found that just mounted on a post beside the driveway it was seeing trucks  feet away and alarming
moved it to the other side where it only sees a fence and pasture
kept false alarming
i figured tall grass blowing in the wind
i used tape to mask off most of the sensor
still got false alarms
i could get rid of the false alarms but only by restricting it so much that it couldnt see the car in the driveway
so i used a pvc pipe coupling as a barrel so i could leave the sensor more open and restrict the angle of view
seemed to work
but then on a foggy night i couldnt see the car anymore
i have put too much time already into it
im returning iti conclude that it does work in the sense that it can generate an alarm
it may be fine for something like a closed area where anything intruding at all needs to be detected
a back porch for instance although the cats will probably set it off
and it may be that in just the right driveway setup it could work properly
but i believe those situations are fewgood news it worksbad news it works too muchanything at all will trip it and make it go off
if a bug flies in front of it its going off
if its windy outside it will see the trees moving and it will go off
if its raining that will make it go off
snowing that will make it go offliterally  one slightly breezy day it was going off every  seconds until i turned it offso i dont use them anymorethough they might be useful indoors maybe in the garage or something where theres no movement to let me know if theres an intruder or somethingupdate  i lowered rating to  stars
i would not buy this again
mine worked well until the first set of batteries were down exactly five days after my amazon deadline to return it
the sensor and receiver lights still come on but the alarm no longer works making it useless
mine worked well as a motion alarm until the sound quit
this is not a quality made product
im going to try the more expensive one made by another companyi call this motion sensor system a limited good value buy due to its downfalls that despite the low price will be a deal breaker for many people
im a gadget guy and im budget minded in that i practice money management
i let go of my money at least as hard as it is to get itto save a penny or two someone not they or the company decided to broaden acceptable manufacturing specs such that the motion sensor is enough out of round on both ends that a light wind will cause it to rotate and set off the chimesto hype sensor sensitivity or save a penny by using the most common off the shelf  degree sensor usefulness is  reducedive been experimenting with this unit since i got it to see what exactly i can do with it
people can walk across my driveway on the sidewalk  not activate the chime but a car suvor truck passing by the same way on the street sets it off every timewhat many people want is a more focused sensor like mall stores had to compensate for having a wide open door way
more like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through
like it is with hearing aids the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution
the chinese have a less mba notion of profit
guess ill have to search chinese retailers for the inexpensive low energy feature rich security sensor  digital revolution technology makes possiblei had one it worked for a few months
it was very loud ended up placing the receiver outside on the porch
it was so loud we could hear it inside
it finaly went out after watter got in it
opened it up and discovered that even tho it has a seal the back where the screw mounting hole is not sealed
worked for a few more months after drying it out and then quit
do not place anywhere where it can rain on it
suggest under a eve or inside some type of box
its not rated for outdoor usetrash
goes off every hour on the hour as the sun travels the sky
any type of shadow makes it go off
i keep jumping out of my chair thinking someone is making off with my backyard ho and i dont mean my girl
ha
also the distance from the transmitter to the base is nowhere near what they say
i would say about ft maxoh it works alright but it also has lots of false alarms
im working with to try to locate it where it wont go off every five minutes
cant determine if its clouds shadows or wind that causes it to go off so ofteni have tried everything to avoid false alarms but it seems to me that this item needs to look across a perfectly barren expanse to work
i have a few ishfoottall trees on both sides of my drive within about  feet of the pavement and every time its windy at all as well as occasionally when its not the sensor activates falsely
the only thing moving in its view when it goes off is tree limbs  or so feet away
narrowing the sensors field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed while about  open still gets lots of false alarms
i have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results
upon thinking about it more it seems obvious that a motion sensor is going to go off if anything nearby is moving so any trees it its view would spoil its efficacy
i give it two stars because it does go off when somebody goes by it but even a few false alarms every hour is too many
doesnt anybody make an electriceye type of driveway sensor
why not
my garagedoors electriceye stopper works greatvery dissaponted with the product
did not pick up signals as reviewsand the alarm sensor was not very loud
i had it one week and returned itjust did not do what the many reviews said it didi would not waste your time on purchasing a toshiba pda
i bought my e arund july of  and it has been in for service twice for hw issues and stability issuesto add insult to injury toshiba will not be offering an upgrade to wm for the e community
i would not trust them to do the same with their new quotflagshipquot product the ebuy another pda do not get burnedive owned the toshiba e for several months now
i bought it to replace an ipaq  which needed an external b pc card to do wireless
very bulky
the e is a reasonable attempt at a selfcontained wireless pda
with builtin b wireless switchable in hardware and software to conserve battery life it is a decent package
much more compact than my compaq ipaq  with an external b cardunfortunately the reliability is poor
the pda kept loosing its memory forcing me to reinstall the backup software and restore the applications and pim information
this was a major pain
finally the e stopped working all together
push the power on button and nothing happens
the battery is fully charged so it must be a failure in the pda itselfguess its back to the ipaq  for mei have owned this little hub for at least a year
i have an older pc which came without usb so i added a pci adapter
i soon realized that i needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floori shopped around and this item looked appropriate
as for the short cord i solved that issue by getting a usb extension cord at the same time
besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purposefor a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do
i attached an external hard drive through it
i used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera
i connected an inkjet printer
everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly
this was all with windows  se
but after a while things started getting less reliable
the system would tell me that various drives on the flash card reader or the external hard drive were not available
or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software
and the printer even started disappearingplaying with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually i deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device
either way it has finally become a big problem and i am shopping for a replacementmost of the devices i connected were selfpowered that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the pci channel at all
the hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or ac adapters of their own
and the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine
it does not matter what combination of devices i try sooner or later the connection goes badit is of course possible that theres something wrong in the pc  but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself
so i have to recommend against buying it
i suspect it is discontinued and that this advice wont be necessary for much longer but i want to prevent somebody from the bother ive been through just in caseused it for good  months
it was bargained priced for the features it offered
average user interface
played everything i put in it and for the time it worked i really thought it was a good bargain
but like another reviewer mentioned it wont read anything any more
tries to load and ends up with no disc
im sure somebody in china would want the metal casing back so they could recycle it into another feature rich bargain electronicstake a close look at the picture before ordering thisits only got two real buttons
the scroll wheel is used as the middle button which is quite awkwardsound is for the teens  boommie w no details but  this price its okwhen the box said strong bass they meant it
dont pay mind to the marketing teams generic word replacements like strong stereo and dynamic and all that other bull
what you gotta look for is great basetreble balancethese phones while very comfortable to wear are a nightmare to listen to
not that theyre that bad but theyre just for bass
if you want to listen to nothing but bass beats buy this now
if you listen to real music dont give these a second thought
the bass is just overpowering and with the still comfortable seal it makes around the ear the pressure sort of hurts if youre playing music too long
but thats just me
maybe im a priss
i dunno
but i know classical techno jazz and rock and this made that musicsimply put sound badpros comfortable nice price for the size and materials used long cordcon not music headphonesbass headphones
remember thisim returning mine tomorrowthe ear cups on this model are not intended to fit overaround the ears theyre a little too smallthe bass is over done
they dont have a bass boost switch or anything like that
they just blare the base and muddy the music at all times
if you like that sort of thing then this will be a bonus for you but i regard it as a detrimenti bought these with hopes of good sound quality at a reasonable price and unfortunately they did not deliver
i have an expensive headset for my computer that has a usb plug and i needed something with a  plug so i got these and they are not very good
i recommend some sony over ear headphones like you used to see people use with their cd players over these
just my opinionthese things have beautiful sound quality i wont complain about that
i dont have big ears but these really really do hurt my ears as they dont fit all the way around them so after about  minutes of use its incredibly uncomfortable
the long cord is great but for whatever reason they dont fit my ears or else i would give  starsi have the same problem with both pairs of sennheiser headphones
they worked great for a few months then one side starts going out
i suspect it is the cord
i guess i got my money worth but would expect them to last longer since they are only used sitting at my desk and there has never been any damage chewed cord etci purchased these headphones because of the good rating but maybe i just got a lemon
after a few months the left ear phone stopped working
i had to wiggle the cable to start it back up until it finally got wiggled out and quit working
the cushions fit perfectly over my ears but after all day usage it would start to feel uncomfortable
i used them mainly for music while studying and everything seems fine until the above happened
too bad it was too late to return
hope you guys have a better experiencethis product looks nice but will die after a couple of months even if you do nothing to it
it is cheap so i guess one has to kind of expect that
id just save my money until i could get a decent pair of headphones
these are not worth iti have used these headsets for about  months now and while they are some of the best sounding headsets i have ever owned they are by far the most uncomfortable i have ever worn
if i wear them for more than an hour or so i start to get terrible pains in my ears totally unacceptable imo
other than the pains theyre great
only  with shipping a long cord with a device to store the extra length decent build quality and they have good sound for the price
however the pains are getting on my nerves so i am probably going to invest in the motorola bluetooth headsets i see on amazon only  and i can eliminate the cord
i will keep these headsets for back ups
so if youre going to buy them try wearing them for awhile when you get them if they hurt you i hear amazon has a great return policythe sound is good enough to live up to sennheiser expectations but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears rather than your scull bone so it is uncomfortable and too warmi have a lighter sennheiser at work that i wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear
when i come home and put on this heavy uncomfortable set i am always disappointedoverall the sound quality is very goodthe ear cushions are too small to fit over your ear and are uncomfortable to wearthe head band is marked with a l and a r but it is marked the wrong way to have the headband parallel to your head which makes me wonder which speaker is wired right and which is left
i mostly use these for watching movies and which side is which can make a big differenceall in all im going to buy a different headset in the near futurei am surprised by the high rating these headphones have received
i based my decision to buy these on the reviews
i dont know what shape heads you guys have but these cans just crushed the sides of my head
the fact that the cups dont fit completely around the ears did not helpsound wise there was almost no midrange at all
instruments did not all come through the sound and while bass was fairly strong it was mainly thumping and not pleasantim surprised sennheiser would even want to tarnish their name with these inferior headphones
i most definitely recommend trying a different pairokay some backgroundcircumaural  goes totally around your eatssupraaural  sits on top of your ear but doesnt surround itthe problem with these headphones is that they are made out of the material you would expect a circumaural headphone to be made out of so it is stiff not soft but it is supraaural so that stiff material sits on your ear and presses it into your skull
to see what this might feel like take your finger and make a hook and then lay it flat against your ear and press it against your headthe headphones are unbearable for more than  minutes at a time so while they may be good for traveling or on the bus listening to a music player they are not good for regular computer use
get a circumaural headphone or a supraaural set that isnt as stiff as a rockthese are really great soundquality headphones
only problem isthey died after two years of light use
so im giving them  stars for reliability
i sure wish reviewers would update their reviews periodically so we can learn more about an items reliability and endurance over timeone year of light use and the cord is already starting to fray at the connection point with the right earpiece
difficult if not impossible to repairthese headphones really do sound great for the price
unfortunately they hurt my ears
the phones are just way too narrow and i get discomfort from wearing them after  minutes or so
 update  i would now give this item stars
ive figured out a way to adjust the phones so that my ears do not hurti bought this based on its reviews  wanted a cheap but decent sounding set of headphones to just leave at my desk so i wouldnt feel too bad if they got loststolen
i guess i shouldnt have expected much for  but the audio quality on these headphones is really poor
not enough midrange tinny trebles and severely boosted boomy bass
leaves me with the impression that im listening to music in a small metal box
my cheap pc speakers sound better
avoidwhy would they make a cord that is like ft long
what are you supposed to do wind it up and put it in your pocket
the construction of these are very cheap just one piece plastic headband that hurts your head
the cord is very thin and will break easily if snagged
it has decent sound similar to all the cheaper over the ear headphones  on the market
another problem i had with these as i have with all overtheear headphones is that they make your ears sweat really bad
i just cant wear them very long because of that
i have relegated these to my use when making some recordings because of the long cord but i never wear them while listening to my iphone because of the long and very fragile cord
i know if i snagged them one time the cord would breaki bought the sennheiser hd s at the same time as the pioneer sems  the sennheisers are comfortable light weight slimsleek and seem decently durable however soundwise i dont care for them for my applicaiton  they certainly have enhanced bass but it really isnt a good thing imo  the bass sounds processed and too heavy  not a good sonic balance and not a pleasant listening experience for me  i much prefer the balanced sonics of the pioneer sems which are in the same ballpark pricewise ok maybe these will fit you fine and not hurt your ears or head but if so you are the lucky one
im not so lucky
i bought these because i needed some back up headphones while i returned by shure ec earphones to the company for repair
i previously had some sennheiser px  collapsible headphones that i had given to my daughter when her ipod earphones ceased working
i love the px s
great sound much better thant the hd s and extremely comfortable
my only hesitation with those was the apparent fragility of the cords though after a year of use they are still going strongthere are two reasons that these hurt my head
first the tension gives me a headache if i use them for more than an hour
there is just a tad too much pressure on my head
and they dont adjust very much
second i wear glasses
so the phones press my ears against the stems of my glasses really making my ears hurt after awhile
these are easily the least comfortable headphones ive ever ownedthe sound is good for their price
the sound of my shure ecs were much better but they are far more expensive
i find the bass strong but a bit muddy on these headphones
i hadnt owned a pair of overtheear headphones in a long time
i never will again
from here on out i get nothing but ontheear headphones or intheear earphoneswhen i get my shures back im going to retire these headphones
because the twoyear warranty of the shures end in january i think i will either get a better model of shure earphones or perhaps branch out and try the bose earphones
but one thing is for certain  i wont be using these hd  headphones for longi own this hd for year in term of built quality i would say its  stars still functioning well no failure yet
in term of performance its fairly good within the price range i gives it  stars
however the comfort level is way way low
its very uncomfortable and hurt if using  straightwith both my headphones and the one that my brother owns the plug in which you insert into the audio jackis flimsy and occasionally you lose audio quality in my right headphonehave to fenagle with it a little bit to get it working butdisappointing considering that the headphones are sennheiseri think these headphones are a joke and happily i bought another pair for  that are good
i hate digital music and prefer vinyl
i have been an audiophile for  years
digital music has no depth or warmth
the worse thing about these headphones is the comfort
they hurt and feel cheap
do yourself a favor and spend at least  on a good pair of headphones
it helps the sound of digitali have no complaints about the sound quality of these headphones
it is a pity though that they were not made to last  after only about  years of light office use the plastic shielding on the cable shows signs of cracking and the leatherette cushion on the headband has fallen off
the headphones still sound good thoughi just received them in the mail yesterday and these headphones hurt my head
after wearing them to watch a movie on my computer i had a terrible headache
i will be returning them to amazon for a refund and to find another pair
im really disappointed after hearing such great reviews about the sound
i bought them to replace my sony mdrv
they are ok but the pads come off too much and the sound isnt that greatso in all the sennheiser hd pro sound is good not great but the headset are very uncomfortable
they dont reduce external sounds
the price for them are good but not worth these headphones
they seem very durable
they just need some way to adjust the fittingtotally disappointed with these
ive used  koss and jvc cans that had wider ranges and sound better
in fact sennheisser has better cheaper cans
i thought maybe i gotten a bad pair
i gave them two stars because they are great for voice and absolutely flat music
any bass seems to make them strain and distort
these didnt come close to my old senn that i paid about  marks back in the day while stationed in germanyultimate slap against these cans are they cant stuff monster sells in the same price range lol
id spend a little more money and get the s from sennheiser in stead of these
i like sennheiser cans only buy them and beyer dynamics
if denons were cheaper id buy themsounds great hear all the noise
ruins your mp collectoin like it shouldcord is too long and coiled too tightly wraps around everything on set or in my office
stuck in my office chair all the time
bulky construction pulls itself down all the time and hurts my ears after a couple of hours which i edit  hours a day on average so this kinds sucks
the jack is loose all other headphones stay in my computers  jack these pop out with the slightest twist
even with a annoyingly long chord it still manages to wobble out and either go into mono or just disconnect and then get wrapped in my chair so i cant put them on again
will not buy again probably wont keep eitherthe headsets are fairly well built and the sound is good
i have a big head so they clamp down and after a while they gete uncomfortable but i would not call this a flawwhere my problem came is on the coiled cable the cable lost the memory of the coiling and it became an unruly mess this happened  months after i got them as a giftmine were given to me by my wife christmas of  in november of  i tried contacting the company to see if anything could be done they told me i could buy a new cable and when i asked if this is not something that should be covered under warranty i never received a replyno way am i going to buy a replacement cable that will most likely do the same thing within a short period of time
i will look elsewhere next time i am looking for headsetsi ordered these headphones expecting sennheisers smooth sound and comfortable fit
needless to say i did not achieve eitheri read the reviews here and as i know headphone reviews are very subjective i gave them a try
i happen to own a pair of sennheisers right nowa very old set that isnt produced anymore
i wanted an upgradewhen i first received the phones i tried them immediately and i was shocked at how harsh they sounded
i forgave the fact that they were crushing my head since i felt i would be able to adjust them somewhat
not so
i tried stretching them apart without breaking them but it didnt help muchsince reading many reviews here suggesting breaking them in soundwise i played a few cds on an endless loop for many hours a day
to be honest they did improve somewhat
however i didnt feel like waiting a month to decide whether they would improve enough to warrant the expense and i returned themi suggest these headphones for those with smallish heads those who like a somewhat harsh powerful sound and those who dont like bass at all
i am not a big fan of booming bass but i could not detect any bass whatsoever from these phones which is odd for a closed ear headphonei gave them  stars even though i considered giving them  star because they seem to be built quite well and headphones are very subjective as you can tell by the differing reviews herebut what the heck amazon will take them back if you dont like them so tight fit harsh sound and lack of bass notwithstanding give em a shot if you think they are up your alleyi wish i would have paid closer attention to other reviews first but here are some reasons that i ended up sending my hds back
my use case is perhaps different than others
i am not a professional musician
i am a programmer by trade and i sit for  hours a day
music and noise isolation are important to me but so are comfort and sound quality
i have a cheap pair of sennheiser px s that i use at my desk for the majority of the time and they work and sound and feel great
i wanted something a little better sounding and that would cancel out airplane engine noise for my infrequent flying for work
while the hds did a pretty good job at isolating me from the airplane engine noise the negatives i found far outweigh that positivecomfort
or rather lack thereof
at least on my head these headphones really squeeze tightly to the point that they were giving me headaches
i guess this is important to keep outside noise out but it was too much for me
in addition they really made my ears hot and sweaty and during summer i could not use them even in an airconditioned roombulk
these are huge
like huuuge
no really theyre big
and heavy
they take up a whole lot of room and this is important to me since one of my reasons for buying them was to use on airplane flights
but theyre so big that taking them on airplane trips is just not practical
also the long cord while im sure its awesome for professional musicians or someone working at a sound board is really big and bulky and heavy and kept getting in the way while i was on the plane and sitting at my desksound quality
i was expecting that for  the sound quality was going to be amazing
but it really wasnt
other reviewers commented on the lack of a lower end and its really true
its not just a lack of bass punch but really anything lower in the audio spectrum sounded like it was just lacking
im no audiophile but my cheap open sennheiser pxs sound better
anyway i was disappointed with these and i returned them
i still dont have a good solution for my next airplane trip but these werent a viable option for mei found these very uncomfortable on the top of my head as soon as i put them on
they were returned without ever testing the sound but i have owned other sennheiser headphones and they typically sound excellenti tried three different headphonessennheiser  prosound was very good especially after some burnin
but very uncomfortable
way too tight  really clamp down hard on your head
this produces great isolation and theyre well built but this is useless if you cant wear them
note i dont have a big headaudio technica athmthe sound on these was mediocre and they sit on the ear not around the ear so they dont isolate well at all
they are more comfortable than the s and much lighter but they also feel a little weird being on the ear and i dont know why anyone would buy closed headphones that dont isolateshure srhi think these sound the best
maybe not quite as clear as the senns but they are more dynamic
they feel less like the sound is in a tin can
the sound feels closer
they are very well made
probably the best made of the bunch
and they are comfortable
not as tight as the senns and isolate almost as well certainly well enoughi bought it since the price temporarily dropped
after using it for one day i decide to return it
the build quality is ok but it is  plastic feeling
sound quality is ok clean but not deep nor expressive but why do i buy a usd heavy headphone just because it is ok
it is way tooooo tight
it is not about the pain on the ears it is about the pain right on the contact point on my headi dont have abnormal size head the pain is instant on and it kills all the possible fun of listening to musicconclusion if you love to pay usd to get a device to press hard on your head go for itif you plan to buy a music listening device then forget about itsennheiser  modded to  and sennheiser  are far better than thesesony dlp is better in my opinionear cups are not soft and made of a material that squeaks against my glasses
i would prefer the soft pads of the bose qcqc on theseif you like you sound loud and dynamic you might as well forget this headphoneplaying titanic sound track which is a very good album to test speakers and headphones made this speaker miserablepowering it by a pioneer elite and sony es cd player bass distortion was all over the place at loud levelsi had to reduce the volume to  to have clean sound but level was awfully low
no funthe set was already broken in while got better still incapable of playing clean bassanother issue is coil cable
it is a large headphone with strong clamping forceit is really not worth owning this set for anything other than low level applications such as mp video and so forth
not recommendedthese headphones are very good for audio quality but are uncomfortablei listened to these albums krall  when i look in your eyes bennet  through the years celso fonseca  natural nora jones  come away with me methany hayden  beyond the missouri sky agnes obel  philharmonics the soundtrack to midnight in paris and a variety of classical rock and world music
the celso fonseca album sounded the bestit has bright acoustic guitar and percussion
the midnight in paris sounded great on speakers and cheaper phillips travel headphones but some tracks became muffled on the s while others were great
i am not sure why that is other than to say the recording really matters as much as the speakers the sound comes out of and the ears hearing iti agree that there is probably a break in period
as new headphones they are a bit bright overall
warning these can playback at extremely high decibles
you really need to check your volume before hitting play and in itunes turn sound check on i normally have it off to prevent pain and hearing damage if you go from a soft track to a noisier onesadly i will be returning them
they are just too uncomfortable
the top cushion despite looking like it is cushy is not padded enough and is painful
just gravity collapses the inadequately dense foam right to the plastic onto the skull
the side pressure clamping
is just too tight and my head starts to hurt right away
they are a bit too heavy as well
one wonders that if just another  in better engineered top foam would have solved the weight issuewhen i hold them up against gravity and out slightly relieving the weight and pressure they sound is great
i think they just made the hard plastic too dense and too responsive
the plastic is like oak but it needs to be more like bamboo or willowthey can also be hot with the sealed cupsso hot heavy painful great sounding headphonesthis is the most uncomfortable headphone ive ever worn
good isloation good material and decent sound quality
but very very uncomfortable
would not recommend to anyone who is looking to wear these for a long period of time
 out of these are really tilted toward the high frequencies
if you have upperend hearing loss these might be just the thing
as others said not much bass either
went back to my akg ksthey sound so much more natural
expected more from sennheiser
im a musician and studio ownerbut they were just not very goodthe cushions were stiff and creaky and made listening a nightmarecord was long enough to reach the moon it seemedin the end i returned thesemy grado  is more than  years old
the grado  has clearer high more natural mid deeper low and richer sound stage than this new sennheisher  pro i received today
the  does have better isolation due to enclosed design
that isolation also comes with a price it get hot very fast while i can listen to the grado  for over an hour without notice any heat or fatigue on my ears
i had my wife and son listen to both on various songs with the volume lower on the grado since that headphone is more sensitive than the  we have no doubt the grado  is much better sounding than the  after  minutesthe grado  cost me  years ago and it is still selling at that price cheaper than the  on special sale
if you want to buy this unit you owe yourself a listen to the grado  firstas good as they may sound i have not been able to get past the extreme discomfort these cause my rather big head
they are too tight too heavy too hot im always conscious they are on and i just noticed as i kept find pieces of black plastic on the floor around me that the headband has been shedding its skin and mustve been for awhile as big chunks of it are now gonesince i read that sennheiser will replace them under their warranty i am hoping they will consider sending me a different model insteadi purchased the hd sennheiser headphones about a year ago for  from amazon via jr
the headphones sound nice but after  minutes of wear i was getting headaches from the pressure
the headphones clamp on your head too much
ive tried to adjust them but no luck theres always excessive pressure
i ended up buying cheaper sony headphones that dont sound as nice but are extremely comfortable on my earshead
i do not recommend these headphones
it doesnt matter how great they sound if youre getting headachesi have owned these headphones for  years under limited use
they are too big awkward and too fragile to take outside of the home
i rarely use them since i use headphones most on the go
i was really disappointed when they fell apart on me in the st year i owned them
i never subjected them to any harsh conditions but the plastic in the head band cracked and has only stayed together with gorilla glue and fragile handlingthe sound was decent
i liked how much they isolate all other sounds and there is no need for headphones with noisecancellation when youve got a pair of these
i like to listen to movies loud with my wife asleep next to me and gratefully these headphones let very little sound out
although it is faint she does hear it stillthe bass is poor
you will be immersed with the full range of sound but not moved by it
and im usually fine without much bass but surprisingly the new hds are much more enjoyable in that arenai just cant get over the fact these broke on me so quickly
they are still usable they are just fragiletitle pretty much sums up how i feel about it
it has amazing quality sound with excellent bass and good noise reduction
but it does feel like im wearing a large and painfully heavy ibeam on my head
its not thats it is actually heavy
its the design of the headphones
they are build to go on ones head like a bow
as in what goes with an arrow not a ribbon
the top of the head being the bending point putting all possible pressure on one very small area
they put a pad there to help with this which didnt seem to do anything
if it was designed to spread this pressure over a larger area im sure it would negate most of the discomfort but whichever engineer spearheaded this must a have a head made of solid concrete or b not paid attention to almost every pair of headphones made for the last few decades
most larger sized headphones use a form fitting band of some sort to distribute pressureits rather sad as i was looking forward to using these headphones for quite a while
it took about an hour for me to get fed up with the discomfort and repack them for a return
i couldnt even enjoy any music during this short time being distracted and all
it doesnt matter how great the sound quality is if they are unwearable
even if its really really really good sound quality
alsofor sizing issuesthis was not caused by having a large cranium as i am pretty much the average man with a hat size of  
guess ill just go for s or something
shame this product lessened sennheiser for me
though ive tried some of their midtierabout  headphones and they were both comfortable and had great sound
oh well learning experienceside notethey came black not silver like the picture
think that was the only nice surprise being that im not a big silver fanaside from the fact that your ears will hate you while wearing these for the first few hours of their lifespan as they conform to your ears i find the sound quality questionable
compared to my sennheiser pmx headphones which i bought later on for half the price mind you the sound here is slightly muffled and distorted which is unacceptable to me
the durability and volume strength seem nice but i dont even bother using these anymore when my  pmx sounds noticeably betterthis device is as clunky as a hammer made of jello and feels about as ergonomicnot sure what garmin was smoking when they made this but lets  see monochrome with bad lighting controls awful menu tiny useless buttons serial cable connect to pc yeah the totally obsolete no reason to use serialthe port no computer has had for a long time battery compartment is well stupid but unlike the other featuresso lets summarize junk and obsolete junk this thing pisses me off and costs a couple hundred dollarsjust buy a real gps they cost less and work and one can only hope garmin and the other mfrs have come out of the stone age and use usbi purchased this two weeks ago and was concerned that the tripod screw was too short since it barely sticks up beyond the padded plate on the bottom of the bracket  but i was able to screw it into the tripod and use it during a tradeshow event i was recording
but  once i unscrewed it from the camera after shooting with it for two days  the bracket will not reattach
i think the stress it caused on the camcorders thread caused the threads inside the camcorder to strip and since the tripod stud doesnt go in deep  it wont reattachit would have cost nothing for sima to include a longer stud for the tripod mount
what were they thinking
if you can get it to work with your camcorder then its well worth it  but not worth much otherwiselikes  two shoemounts allowed me to mount both a boom mic azden sgmx and an azden wireless mic receiver wmxprodislikes  stud too short and cant use on left side with most camcorders since the bracket wont clear most lcd screens when the screens are openi was hoping that by getting this id get a decent flow of air and id be able to use it anywayer
but i was sorely dissappointed
it doesnt give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel plus its too loud to use in most placesif you really need it you can get it but i cant use mine often because like i said its too loud
not worth it not enough air flowingthe sound quality of portable cd players has been on the same downward spiral that most sound equipment takes when commoditized for the mass market
the reason for this is simple  joe duh average wants features not sound quality
if you read most of the reviews most people are talking about features
one selfproclaimed quotaudiofilequot sic says the quotbass sounds goodquot but mostly mentions featuresnote that the manufacturers dont even list real specifications anymore like total harmonic distortion  thd signaltonoise ratio  sn output level etc
because joe duh doesnt understand or care what these things mean
joe cant see the opamp or compressor inside the machine  but he can see whether it has a remote control or not
why anyone needs a remote control on a portable cd player is beyond me
so when joe goes to the store to select a portable cd player he buys the one that has the most visible features
joe wants to get his moneys worth after all
so what do you do if you are a manufacturer
where do you invest your money
this is why most portable cd players have a muddy unbalanced sound these days and this player is no exception
if you look at its specifications it lists features
the frequency response range really doesnt tell you much and that is the most you can get out of them
but just listening to it is a real disappointment
it is fascinating to me that people are willing to pay extra for things like avls when this is redundant  just use the volume control
check this out  they try to pass it off as a feature it quotguards your hearing by capping your listening levelquot
thanks big brother
sony doesnt wanna get sued
although they arent going to tell you the output level it is only about mw per channel
it is sturdy and doesnt skip  everyone is right about that
it is heavy and bulky if you want to carry it in your hand while jogging however
if you are a true audiophile i would recommend looking elsewhere
they arent making good quality portable cd players anymore and the one i finally found is the best i could get from what is available and it isnt even on the market anymore
i got lucky and found a distributor that happens to have a stock of them and when they are gone my guess is that there will be no more to buy anywhere
that player does not have the mp which is fine with me
it is the panasonic slct and they are going for about  original price on release was closer to  i think
the slj is the same player but it has a remote control which doesnt interest me
it has a sn of  db and mw per channel output level
it is light not as sturdy as the sony but the sound quality is much clearer and the response curve is better
of course no one ever uses the earphones that come with any of these players  i use either one of sonys mdr series or sennheisers ps for exercising
the results with this particular configuration are pretty goodi had to buy the actual one from meade
in fairness i dont have a celestron scope to test it onthe next adapter i purchased for my telescope and cannot see anything yet with my telescope
my dslr cannot focus on anything because i cannot find a lens to fit it
not a problem with the product a problem with finding lenses
if you have a telescope withe the lenses that fit i am sure it will work perfectlythis particular celestron tadapter is too long for my celestron telescope their cheapest reflector making it impossible to focus
on the other hand the celestron  tadapter with barlow lens worked perfectly
im sending this one back and keeping the i bought this  adaptor along with the celestron tring
the tring works great on my d
it is not too snug and it clicks in place just like my lenses
i dont recommend the celestron adaptor though
fortunately my meade adaptor has the same threads and it is much deeper
the celetron adaptor doesnt accomodate large eypieces very well
the eyepiece protrudes too far into the camera body with my these pads are advertised to stop vibration to the telescope
they do not stop vibration at all
dont waste your moneyreceived the wrong remote however it works with my tv it isnt worth the trouble sending backthis remote controller was quite a dissapointment
i am using two other philipsmagnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better
this one does not look like the picture which looks more like the  model
it does not cover the equipment i have while the  model does its learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least
the range is shorter then that of the s
conclusion  this would make for a nice ornament it does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devicesseems to work fine but its not clear from the description that it only protects  line not all  pins of an rj phone cablei purchased  of these thinking i would add them behind my lcd and led wall mounted tvs
these will not fit behind a standard wall mounted tv as such i have returned themif you have only sony devices it is great but if you have other brands you will have to add functions to what is already provided for that brand the manual is horrendous incomprehensible unusable
considering the complexity of the device the manual is inexcuseable when you put the remote in setup mode the fields on the lcd display flash unfortunately they flash very rapidly and i for one was not able to read them when they were flashing so fast
this makes programming the device extremely frustrating frighteningly complex to try to program i have been a software engineer for over  years and i had to program it to use my replay since brilliantly it did not include page updown or a button to bring up the channel listings for this preset device the preset sony devices have much better functionality if you are over  or have presbyopia of any degree forget being able to see the lcd buttons without your glasses they are small and dim without the backlite
did i mention that they flash very rapidly when you are trying to program them
frankly i am giving up and returning the unit it really was not worth the effortgood luck to those of you who choose to keep itwhen this remote came onto the market im sure it was an icon
the ability to program macros is invaluable in a component home theater system however you need a phd to program and operate the thingthis remote is monstrous confusing finicky and defines antielegance
that said i used it for years and it served its purpose until the damn thing reset itself
theres no way i was investing the  hours it takes to program everything properly in it a nd time
if you can get one of these on donation have fun spending half a day getting it working and that much time or more teaching your family and friends to use it
i wouldnt pay a dime for it though
i didntthese days this thing is more an eye sore than a convenience
believe me youd much rather fiddle with  remotes but if youre up for a challenge and get some sort of guilty pleasure out of tormenting yourself and your loved ones this is the remote for youmy suggestion though is to stop living in the past and get a real remotefirst of all this is an ok remote but for money there should be more
i have a great system wiht about  devices
this remote does do its job but there are many faults
first of all the thing is gigantic
you would think sony would make it smaller after their first remote completley bombed
another thing is that the blue backlight is great but for god sakes the other buttons which control the most basic and most useful functions like the channel and volume buttons
i really dont think that it was a good idea not to include a backlight on these buttons
the third thing that i really money remotes that can go farther than this one
overall it isnt a bad remote and i would have given it a  but it is definitley not worth the price hence the  if your really want a good remote go with the rca touch screen or the sima touch screen
both are around money and do everything this does plus they are much smallerthis is my nd pair of these headphones on my first pair the foam ear pieces wore out and since these are sony their are no replacements for them
so i bought a brand new set of headphones and now these ear pieces have worn out
they lasted about a year each time
im going to try the jensen behind the ear headphones this time and see if the foam lasts longeri was having trouble receiving a few digital tv channels from my cable company
the cable company couldnt figure out why my screen would go from ok to black back to ok  they were sure there was something wrong with my coax cable inside my home
i installed the motorola signal booster after my cable had gone through two signal splitters
it didnt help the problem with my pictureeventually i solved my problem by bypassing one of the splitters and removing a signal trap that the cable company had placed on my line when my home was built
maybe the motorola signal booster would have worked had i been able to place it immediately after the signal trap
i couldnt do that easily because there was no electrical service near the spot where the signal trap was as the cable entered my homei read all the reviews and decided to give it a try
i have cable but wanted something to help with an antenna when and if i have cable problems
i hooked it to a small rabbit ear type and a tv with builtin receiver also tried it on an outdoor antenna which ran to a digital converter box and then to the tv
both have signal strength metersresults i cant see any difference with the rabbit ears no gain in any way
with the outdoor antenna i dont see any difference except the signal strength meter does show a very small gain on the very best channel that did not need improvementexample signal going from  to  on the channels that had lower signal strength no increase was noticedi called motorola and talked to a very nice person for  minutes who researched it with someone and came back to say the booster was really only meant to help if you were using cable and had one tv on a long line from the other tvmy question was simplewhy does the printed information on the box say improved uhfvhffm antenna reception as the primary purposehe didnt have an answeri live  miles from springfield missouri and the digital signals were freezing up regularly
i have a fairly high roof antenna no cable or dish
and i could not get public tv at all on one of my tvs
so i purchased this device with high hopes
my  tvs still freeze up and i still cant get public tv on one of the two tvs
i was very disappointed in this so called signal amplifiermy tv picture improved greatly using this booster but my cable modem performance downgraded drastically
my cable modem return signal strength degraded i suffered high packet loss and i was experiencing dropped connections
to fix the problem i switched to a channel vision c  db rf amplifier which combines a slitter with an amplifier all in one unit
it has bidirectional amplifiers
now i have a great connection for my cable modem and i have a great tv picture at the same time
i also so have a cleaner less cluttered solution in my cable junction box since i dont use any passive splitters now
the motorola  signal booster should only be used for tv signals or where you have a strong enough return path signal for your cable modem since this booster does not amplify the return pathit actually degrades it somei tried this on my comcast cable system
i even bought the monster ghz splitters which in fact do work well but this socalled booster just boosts electrical noise on all  of my tvs
its funny  comcast says i must have one of these on my system  one of theirs i suppose  but after  tries with it i just gave up
my pictures are clearer without it and it doesnt even make a good doorstopjust got a hd tv and the picture for nonhd channels was poor via brighthouse
tried this booster at various spots in the path to the tv and it made little difference
the problem is most likely the cable company but didnt see this helpingi wanted so badly for this to worki got fewer channels when i plugged this in linei understand that it works for some people but not for methe product description needs a lot more information about what it can do
i had a digital signal that was so poor that it was pixelizing and locking up
i assumed that the amplifier would improve it so that it would stop that
it didnt the picture went away entirely
my satellite service repairman tells me that it couldnt work because it overdrove the signal out of the tuner rangei have an outdoor boosted tv antennae that didnt quite get enough signal for a couple of local stations to the tv in the den the longest cable run in the house
the picture would pixelate andor cut out every once in a while
i put on this booster and it seems to help slightly but i still get an occassional pixillation or cutting outafter three months of use the picture on mine is going out
there is color distortion which doesnt surprise me given the price i paid for it
i could get by with the quotmonoquot sound i could also get by with the limited video inputs but the deterioration in picture quality over time should not be acceptable to anyone given that there are better alternatives out there at not a much higher pricei purchased this camera in november  for almost  years it functioned perfectly then about  weeks ago i suddenly had a black screen
it is now in for repair for the black screen problem for the third time in  weeks
fortunately i purchased a  year extended warranty policy and it hasnt cost me for the attempted repairs
i didnt know the problem could be corrected by whacking the camera
however under the extended warranty no lemon policy after this rd attempt to fix the problem i will be able to get a full purchase price credit towards a new camera of my choice
thanks best buy
i will stick with the sony because i have the extra memory sticks but i will definately buy the extended warranty againpictures are very noisygrainy and colors are inaccurate
many fine textures and details such as woodgrain are almost completely lost
lowering iso settings help reduce the noise but it is still there
software bundle is pathetic
its pretty much just a driver
upsides are that the camera is easy to learn and use it has an afassist lamp its not locked in auto like some other cameras and good rechargable aas and a soso charger is included in the boxsome sony cams leave this out
addressing the person who complained that the camera flashes several times before the shot is taken that is what redeye reduction does
those flashes shrink your pupils which is one of the common ways that redeye is reduced
if you dont like it then turn it off it doesnt get simpler than that
never had a problem with the screen going blank
this was one of the first digital cameras that i used and i took about  pictures with it  i wish all those shots i took with it were taken with a traditional mm camera instead as the results would have been much betterthe first attraction of this headphone radion is its sleek design
the reception is pretty good the sound quality is not great but its radio
people are made of different sizes
this headphone was not design to accomodate that
if you have a small or big head this headphone is not for you
i have a neck size of quot this head barely fit on me
it is very uncomfortable on me my ear feel squashed and pulled by the headphone
sony should have been more considerate to people like me and design a better headphone
they should try harder and made it adjustable to fit all head sizes
im very disappointed but praise its sleek design
if youre petitebigtall this headphone may not be the right for youcompared to the other walkmans what i bought in the past it was halfway working
even it was halfway working when i first bought it
it was halfway working because the headphone jack was all rusty and i had to push the headphone cord to make it work
when i listen to music the sound gets all rusty or the left ear is giving no sound
look im into walkmans like the ss but to be honest is you need to take care of this one
ill rate the reception as a  out of  on the fm because it gives slightly better reception than the other s walkman that i just bought during the summer
on am ill rate it as a  because the reception on am is pretty decent but it gives a little fuzzy reception
the battery power is wellpowered because i didnt change batteries for more than a month already thats cause i was not using that much and it doesnt waste that much batteries
the volume im a little dissastisfied because when the volume is too high it makes noise like the radio is static
so dont turn up the radio too loud
it doesnt give too powerful bass like my other walkman
so to be honest take care of this radiothe reception is poor the controls are difficult to operate the armband is ok but awkward
fortunately at the gym where i work out they have their own frequencies matched with the six tv screens arrayed at one side of the largest workout area and this gizmo works fine there
but when i use the walkman when im running or walking outdoors i get a delightful variety of staticky stationsscott morrisonbut it doesnt
looks well made good install program and options to tweak it
unfortunately i tried everything i could and it would never find my linksys wireless g network i could control it from an ethernet cable ping it should work
i already have a wireless g bridge that works quite well but this one looks like you have  odds for it to work when yo uknow that the latest firmware release was in  its a shame for linksys quality proceduresplus its still pricey for a wireless b im disappointed with linksysalthough it is somewhat more expensive i would recommend considering the linksys g bridge instead of this product
i had a much better experience with the g bridge and you will always appreciate its higher performancegot this to connect a desktop macintosh to a wireless network
i had problems almost immediately setup via cdrom was ok but once configured it would not recognize the router
of note this requires a windows machine to work unable to upgrade the firmware via the utility downloaded from the linksys website until i discovered that the computer had to be set to static using a web interface was impossible none of the changes i made were saved to the wetbottom line if you want to use this for a single configuration without ever changing it then it is ok if you want to use this where you might want to occasionally change the configuration ie
change to peertopeer change wep change base stations then the difficulties in changing configuration make this too much of a hassle to getok okthis is now working in my house and the range seems to be pretty good
i use this to connect my ps online
and it does the job
why the low reviewthe setup was really a nightmare with yahoo dsl
perhaps it would be tough with other providers as wellbut for some reason yahoo needed some special configuring
had the same problem with a netgear router i have
additionally i could not get my computer to communicate with the bridge out of the box
it just was not going to happen
tried and tried before giving up and calling free customer servicecall to customer service gets you linksys india reminded me very much of a similar call i had to make to netgearand man was my connection bad
i mean bad
they must be using satellite telephone or something
the first representative was nice but very difficult to understand which was a problem because she had to run me through an endless scenario of complicated ip changes etc
to get this product working
had to have the poor girl repeat the word advanced to me  times before i understood what she was sayingin the end it took  minutes on the phone to customer service to configure this product and midway through i wondered if my whole network was going to be broken
what an ordeal
even though its working beautifully now im just not sure it was worth it
if i ever change dslcable providers this things going up on ebay before i attempt to reconfigure itso my advice is if something comes out thats a little more intuitive or works better out of the box id go with it unless youre really a network person with expertisei dislike this radio because it was malfunctioning when i purchased it
was unable to set the preset stations
return was swift and easy
that was the good parti have big minor issues with this unit
the most annoying is the protect feature
it only works with the remote
the remote controls the vcr fine except for the protect feature
jeez
you have to hold either the vcr or power buttons down for like  seconds in order for it work
but unlike the other buttons the vcr is as not responsive to this function
i discovered i had to lay on my back and just find where to hold the remote which was different every time
i could use all other functions but with the remote in the same position the protect would not work
plus holding your wrist at an odd angle for several seconds at a time is not pleasant
and the protect remote feature would not even work when the remote was aimedly directly at the unit either close up middle away or far awaythe search functions of the unit have only  forward speed
i prefer the  speed commonality one press while playing forwards slower and the next press forwards fasterthe playback wasnt perfect but wasnt too terrible a picture either
i didnt need the record function so i havent tried that outthe protect feature which i wasnt aware of until i opened the unit was something i really would have liked to use
but the remote prohibits proper use of it so what good is the feature
i dont know yet if ill return this or not
it works and works so far okay
but i cannot recommend it either because these minor annoyances have inconvenienced me in a larger way than should be toleratedin the end i would recommend if youre contemplating this model to pass on it
there are cheaper alternatives that work just as well as this one has for methe recordplayback quality of this unit is very poor
also the front panel tells you nothing but the time of day
i have a clock for that
you cannot even tell which channel you are taping on without going to the onscreen display
to top it off the unit came with a remote that is not in the book
it has a seperate sheet for it but that seems sort of tackyto rca customer service  i just purchased your rca vrhf and i am very angry to find that this unit only has what is called by most vendors commercial skip
as seen below i specifically asked about this feature before buying
the manual describes what everyone else calls commercial skip on pages     there is no set up option forcommercial scan as there is in my proscan vcr
what the hell is going on
why am i being told one thing by your representatives and i get the unit it doesnt even have the feature
if this unit indeed has no commercial scan i will bealerting consumer groups like the bbb because all the advertising and marketing of this product is false
manuel calcagnoresponsefrom rca about commercial advance before purchase dear customer  thankyou for your inquiry on your product
during tape playback thecommercial advance feature allows you to avoid watching mostcommercials on any recording over  minutes long
after the vcrfinishes recording the commercial advance system locates andelectronically marks most of the commercial segments
when the recordingis played back the vcr scans or fast forwards through the markedsegments
either a blue screen or the fast motion video of thecommercial itself can be displayed while commercials are being advancedthrough
commercial advance reduces three minutes of commercial time toapproximately ten seconds slp mode of fast forwarding time

q  sincerely  sarah  original message  from  supportrcahelpcomsent  friday october    pm  torcafaqproductcustomerlinxcom  subject  re contact rcafeature definitions and their use  not applicab le   rikki  thanksfor the response
my main question was to verify that this rca unithas  commercial scanadvance  which automatically bypasses commercialson playback as opposed  to  commercial skip in which a button has to bemanually pressed for  each   seconds
i do not want the latterdoes rca also sell proscan vcrs
if so where are they  availablethey are very difficult to locate
i have an old proscan withcommercial  scan which i really liked
thanks  manuel calcagno  in amessage dated   pm eastern daylight timesupportrcahelpcom writesamazon have the wrong product manual loaded here
the manual linked from this page is for the vr not the vr
the vr this product does not have commercial advancethe vr is an ok vcr but the slp recordings are on the fuzzy side
sound while ok is not up to the sound from an unrecorded program also slightly fuzzy
so not what i would consider a hifi vcrfeatures are reasonable but the remote is poorly designed lots of indistinguishable little buttons that are all positioned in unmeaningful patterns on the remote
first time that i have had to keep an instruction manual by my chair to refer to constantly in yearsso  overall score  out of  an ok vcr for the price lets get real about what i could expect for this price range
but its not great quality
i would not buy this model or probably any vcr from rca againit is a nice player but forget the zoom and the menus are a pain you are in deep dodo if you misplace the manual
i repeat for emphasis there is no zoom control and you are not going to be able to expand a wide screen movie to fill your standard television screengo to the sony website and  the support area and get the manual and take a look
you will not be able to resize the picture to fit the tv
sony may say you can in their advertisement but it did not work for me
i am not technically challenged either
i built my own computer from parts and i installed the replacement electrostatic panels on my martin logansthe picture outputted was very good and the remote was not so goodthis was a great dvd player when it worked
it lasted less than two years and i am incredibly disappointed
i bought it primarily on the sony name
one day i went to put in a dvd and it made a horribled noise and refused to play a single dvdthis is actually the second sony dvd player i have owned and the other one met the same fate
i am not sure if it is just a bum player in a large lot of exceptional ones or sony does not make as good products anymore
this player worked really good when it worked
it gave no warning just crapped out
i also own a panasonic dvd player that has outlasted both sonys so i dont know that i would buy another sony
just be careful and make sure you have a warranty when you purchase one and good lucki purchased this product from amazoncom in may  for 
the maps were outdated and in september garmin offered new maps for 
for such an expensive unit map updates should be freethen the unit stopped working when disconnected from the car battery
i had to send it for repairs at my expense
there was a loose screwthe upgraded firmware has new auto route algorithm which tries to take you back to the old route if you miss a turn
it makes three attempts before doing a full recalculation
i dont like this feature
maybe i took a detour because of an accident or road closure
it should recalculate a new route instead of trying to take me backi used it for several months to guide me from work to home in the evening
i found that suddenly without any reason one night it changed the directions
now it tries to take me back through a slower routeone night it asked me to take an exit where none existed
maybe it was raining heavily and it malfunctioned
pretty dangerousi just found out that my friends spiii deluxe unit died one week before mine went on the fritz
both units were  months old
mine is ignoring key inputs
his died by failing to power up despite the choice of power source
the only consolation is that garmin is willing to fix them for  each
at this point one has to wonder if shelling out the  plus  for the v map upgrade is better than getting a new unit either waas enabled magellan rm or a garmin  for 
seeing the two units die so close to each other in time is a bad testament to the product design
hopefully the new designs of the last  months will be better
spiii is a design from a few years agoi was surprised to see this old unit appear in my recent search for waterproof gps
i still have mine from several years ago and i dug it out to give it a try
it had been used hard for a few years on hikes motorcycle rides lent to the neighbors soaked etcit still works
the graphics and buttons seem ancient compared to the new relatively cheap units but that is still functions is a testimony to the quality of garmin products
cool
i give it just a couple stars because of the antiquated design and features compared to modern unitslarrythis mouse looks cool and it performs well in every area but one scrolling
the  wheelless button is very difficult to control with any precision and it requires a suprising amount of pressure to activate
if you dont do a lot of scrolling then id recommend this mouse but if this is a feature you use repeatedly then id give it a pass and wait for kensington to come up with a better scrolling buttoni bought this to go with my new powerbook
ive owned lots of logitech and microsoft mice over the years  ball optical corded cordless wired wireless  you name it
i currently prefer logiech cordless optical mice but i was intrigued by the scroll strip on this device after hearing the hype about how it was designed for mac os x decided to try it plus it looks cooli loaded the driver software when my computer restarted i was treated to a series of warnings that the driver software was about to compromise my system security
i elected to use it anyway which was pointless since each time i attempted to open the software i got a message that said my kensington mouse background application wasnt running or something to that effect
the mouse was partly functional using the standard mac drivers but i couldnt adjust parameters like doubleclick and tracking speed satisfactorily nor could i custom program the buttons or make use of the third click buttonwell it was off to kensingtons web site
i found new a new driver downloaded and installed it and now i cant find any sign of any kensington drivers or utilities
the error messages are gone but sos the icon for the utility so i still cant program my mouse
my advice get a logitech or ms mousei cant really rate the mouse from a hardware performance standpoint since i cant program it to work the way i want it tooas a longtime mac fan i recently purchased kensingtons muchhyped studiomouse designed especially for mac os x
anyway i basically wanted a nice optical corded two button mouse with a scroll wheeli like the three button design os x is the first mac os that makes having a rightclick option really useful but i loathe the touch scroll in the middle
give me a good oldfashioned rubberized scroll wheel any day
the touch screen is flakey to the core and doesnt work if youve clicked on or even near a scroll bar plus its near impossible to control the degree of scrolling even with kensingtons mouseworks software
i find myself scrolling the old fashioned way clicking into the scroll bar and manipulating the updown arrows with the mouse  of the timethere are much better mice on the market for a lot less
dont buy into kensingtons designed for mac bullthough i will say that one positive is that the mouse worked fine straight out of the box left and right click plus scrolling feature all operable in os  with no software installedonly the third mini button did nothing
the mouseworks  software doesnt come with must be downloaded for os x works great but is only necessary if you want configure clicks to different functionswhen these inear headphones are properly installed and getting them in right is like an installation the sound is amazing
ive heard parts of songs that id never heard before
but the headphones suffer from two massive flaws
the first is that if the headphones move the tiniest bit out of your ear canal the sound quality plummets
this is a huge problem because the cord is so long that it is guaranteed to catch on something and jiggle the earbuds
even when wrapped up and out of the way the cord will respond to the slightest movement and pop the earbuds out of your ears
this is extraordinarily frustrating all the more so because the sound is so good
i do not recommend these headphones to active people or to people that plan on moving much at all
if however you dont plan on moving much with these headphones youre golden
also note that little case that comes with them should be used all the time the earbud pieces will come off in your bag or pocket and the case helps prevent that
it also helps prevent just whipping out your ipod and listening since you have to undo the case and store it but thats the least of your problems with these headphonesafter panning these things on sound quality i realized i left out another important factorthe cord is very poorly designed
as i mentioned in my earlier review i use the iriver hp
this device comes with a remote which is awesome
i figured that the short cord everybody was talking about would be great for me because i have a device with a remote and dont need a few extra feet of cord hanging around since the remote stays relatively close to me even when the unit is in my backpack or jacketjust one problem
there isnt even enough cord to reach your belt region
i dont know how other people use the remote  but i usually clip mine to my pants right at the waistline
the cord just misses your waistline
if you stand perfectly still you can probably pull it off  but if you begin to walk or even turn your body slightly  you will yank the earbuds out of your earsi suppose there are two options    use the cord extension supplied but this will surely give you way too much cord if you are using a remote like i am and only need to reach your waistline
 clip the remote onto an area of your body above your waistline
i did this for a day while i was wearing a jacket which had an inside breast pocket
but the next day i was wearing a teeshirt and no jacket
what are you supposed to do  clip the remote to your  neck extra inches would have made all the difference and allowed people to use the short cord without the extension to reach their beltline which is where im assuming most people clip their remotes  rightpoorly done sonyi bought these on a whim
id been using a set of sennheiser mxs earphones that are a fraction of the price of the sonys
i figured id try something newin terms of comfort the sonys are better and thats the only reason these things get a star rating
they are very comfortable to wear they even come with different sized earpieces so you can choose the most comfortable ones
they also eliminate outside noise almost completely way better than the sennheisers doin terms of design the sonys are awful
due to the design the weight is not distributed equally
the cable coming from the right earbud is x as long as the cable coming from the left earbud
one ear gets pulled on more than the other
the cable is ridiculously too shortfine for if your music player is in your shirt pocket but inadequate if you want to carry it in your hand or in a pants pocket
they give an extension cable with the unit but its far too long
if i attach the cable and put the buds in my ear the cable almost reaches the floor and im six feet tall
poor poor designfinally and most importantly in terms of sound quality the sonys dont hold a candle to the sennheisers
very tinny and shrill sounding
they hurt my ears even at low volume
they sound like a cheap set of phonessave some cashif youre looking for a good pair of earbuds at a good price skip the sonys and get the sennheisers which amazon sells by the waythese are definitely not audiophile headphones but then they are earbud style
what is surprising is the bassregrettably the bass is the only interesting thing about the sound since midrange and treble are seriously lacklustre
in sonys defense these are also the most comfortable earbudstyle phones ive ever useddont expect the midsize rubber pads that come already installed to fit perfectly  one of the things that surprised me was that my left ear needed the larger pad to effect a good seal from outside sounds and to secure the bass responseusing these for watching a dvd movie the fifth element on my laptop was a reasonably pleasant experience   it seems that the excess bass doesnt really mess up movie sound too muchif you thinking of using these for classical or baroque music forget it  the lack of midrange and treble is insanely irritatingin fact im keeping them only because they are very comfortable and small enough to pack in my laptop bag and i have decided that the bass problem is one i can live with for nowipod users might find that using the quottreble boosterquot equalizer setting helps to compensate for the overbearing bass that these generate
if youre using them with a computer for playing music youre going to need to play with equalizer settings to get a more even soundits important to note that unlike most other earbud phones these do significantly reduce ambient sounds with no sound signal applied they work rather well as earplugs so i dont think you should use them in situations where hearing impairment can endanger youive read many a review waxing on about these earbuds but having listened and compared them to many other units imho they are overated and overpriced
they seem totally unbalanced with a muddy boomy bottom end and a high end that tends towards sibilance
some bass improvement can be made by putting small pieces of tape over the three holes on the back of each earbud but i much prefer koss ksc and sennheiser mx   if you absolutely have to have an ear seal i cant recommend anything more than the etymotic ers although priceybought  of these to replace  that came with the camera of the  only one will hold a charge more than  minutes
vary dissapointedabout  years ago koss sold a similar design
i still use my koss phones at work and bought these for home and workout use
the sound and functionality are fine for the intended use
trouble is on the sonys the extender band is made of flimsy plastic koss used metal and with the first tug on the cord it snapped clean through
portable headphones need to be sturdy and these are not
this is one of many disappointments with sony products in recent years
they used to be so good  what happened
if im going to buy a portable product i need to be able to bang it around a little
unfortunately i can find no other manufacturer who makes this design so if you need them buy them but you may need to baby them a littlei foolishly ignored many of the reviews here stating how easily these headphones broke
ive been a happy owner of folding sony sport headphones for over  years and never had a problem so i assumed these headphones would work just as well
for a month they worked alright although there were notably more uncomfortable than previous models due to a slightly larger earbud that didnt fit well in my ear
i went running yesterday wearing a sweatband and my earbud filled up with sweat i dunno what the sweat guard was supposed to do but it didnt work this time
i pulled the earbud out far enough to try to get some moisture out of my ear something ive done with every other sony headset ive owned and snap
there it went
now i only wish someone other than sony or some weird discount brand made these style of headsets as well as they used toyes these headphones are designed well to keep the sweat out of your ears
i bought them to replace the yellow sports inear phones that came with my old casseteradio walkman
with those i had to take them out every once in a while and wipe the sweat off
with these new ones its not a problemhowever im disappointed with the sound quality
i think its because the inear part is bigger than it used to be  it doesnt go into my ear as far as the older model did
and they hurt
after about half an hour they make my ears hurt so bad that i have to give up on them
the foldup feature and sweat guard design is not enough to justify the discomfort and lack of sound quality
i would not buy these again and recommend that other shoppers look elsewhereim training for a halfmarathon and am still trying to find the perfect pair of traning earphonesi picked up these headphones to replace a pair of aiwa hpjs i used for jogging
the aiwas had quit on me within a few months
the sony headphones are well designed they fold up for easy portability in a trifold design
they also sound reasonable as far as intheear headphones go
as with the aiwas the left ear piece stopped functioning after a few months
these outlasted the aiwas but thats a small consolation
i do sweat a fair amount on a k run but the description which sold me on the sony headphones readswaterresistant  stands up to rain snow and occasional splashingmoisture guard mechanism pulls sweat away from ear canalapparently the moisture guard is a gimmick because the left ear piece shorted out from the sweat
ive been looking for another pair of headphones but so far i havent found a pair that would be suitable to take on my jogs
im using my ipod earphones while i keep looking but i dont expect them to hold up with repeated use as theyre not designed for exercisethese were perfect for exercise held on my head very well until they broke in just under a year
i wasnt even putting any particular pressure on them
i will stay away from sony in the futurei really loved these headphones right up until they broke  weeks later
i wasnt rough on them a bit i was folding them back up after a workout and snap they went
i would suggest the nike shj headband headphones
far better qualityi have a pair of light weight headphones from radio shack titanium pro a and i was looking for something a little smaller lower profile
while these sony phones are in the same price range theyre not in the same realm when it comes to sound quality
i can only describe the sound as very muddy
theres plenty of bass response but overall they sound like i had cotton in my ears
if you are at all interested phones that will accurately represent your music try something other than thesethis item has a great sound and fits well on the head and in the ears it fits very firmly and doesnt move around when working out and i work out hard
in use it is fantastic it
butthe downside and its a big one is that it is super fragile
simply folding it i was always afraid of breaking it but there is no real way to store it especially in a gym bag without significantly increasing the risk of breaking it unless you have a hard case that it will fit in for protection
i was only able to enjoy these for a week before i found them snapped in my bag
and i am usually very careful with stuff like this but way too fragile for a workout headphone and that is a big shame because they are one of the best ive ever triedi was surprised to find that this sony box was not able to play a particular ordinary cdrw with about  mps written on it
it was able to play a different one with about  mps
a much cheaper unit was able to play both cds but skipped which was what brought me to look at this oneloading the cdrw with  mps caused the unit to spin up show that it was reading an mp disc count to  and then suddenly shut itself off when it should have started playing
two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior
i was unable to figure out what the difference was between the two cdrws that caused this to happenbottom line buyer beware
this unit looks cool and the navigation works well but it could easily end up disappointing you when you bring it home to play your mps
my search for a mp cd boombox as reliable as my rio volt portable player moves oni have these memorex cdrw and sony cdrw
the sony works everytime and the memorex work once in a while
the reason i believe is the recording speed
sony has x recording while these have x recording
the x recording is unplayable on my car stereo  out of   unfortunately i cant adjust the recording speed with my roxio  program
the cd cant be played or played with a lot of statistic noises
i think if i record with a lower speed it would probably works well
therefore the product was advertised incorrectly when it say it is capable of being recorded up to xthe package arrived on time and the privacy screen did work but it produced diagonal lines running across my laptop screen which was very annoying
i had to return the product which is a fast and easy process with amazon
just in case you are wondering i have a hp elitebook p and resolution is x
like i said the privacy screen did work but it produced the unwanted annoying diagonal linesthe quality of the filter is ok but has some problems
if you glossy side face you its too glossy
dark clothes are reflecting in daylight
if you turn the matt side the glossy side reflects the screen back to it which in turn reflects it again so you see double image for the elements that are brightfurthermore im rating it low because it is very important to fit well and be easily removed and reinstalled
in this case this is a total fail because the x has about  inch margin from teh frame to the viewable area and the filter is only the size of the viewable area which means you have to glue the attachment onto the glossy part of the screenfurthermore this not working well since the this leaves no space for the privacy screen to slide in and out which would not be the case if it were glued to the plastic framei would guess the proper solution is to just get a bigger filter that fits over the entire glossy part of the screenthis screen looked like a good idea at the beginning
it protected my screen from people just walking behind me in the office
the issue i have is that after using the screen for  hour or  my eyes start hurting pretty bad and i sometimes get a headache
not sure if this is normal for everyone by the strain i get to the eyes is not worth the benefit
also the brightness of screen is pretty diminishedin my opinion unless you are working on something highly confidential its not worth to put the screen onim actually quite disappointed
i saw these things being used in banks and thought this would be great for use  school
weve got elevated seating in all of our classrooms and ive always got someone behind me reading my computer screen
the screen can definitely be read from both sides
the further you are away the harder it is to read  of course i didnt need to pay for that
yea it is significantly harder to read from two rows back but someone sitting in the row behind me and to the left or right can still read it unless i turn the lighting on my computer screen way down
i read a bunch of reviews before i bought it and noticed everyone was complaining about the model number on the screen itself getting in the way
so i just bought a larger size and cut it to fit the true size of the screen
it worked perfectlyin sum if i turn the lighting on my computer monitor down it works just finewould i buy this product again
no
would i bother spending another  to replace this product
no its good enoughthese days for table screens this is not  privacy
from top and bottom view i can still see what is in the screenas a college student i didnt want to not have everyone looking at what i am doing most of the time and i thought this would solve it but it did not work as well as i hoped
this is not a stick on filter like one would do to a cell phone but it slides on using cheap stickers on each side of the computer monitor
i tested this from multiple angles using different lighting in the room and brightness of the screen as well as both sides of the filter and i could still see my screen visibly
the only way not to see the screen is to turn the brightness all the way down but even then i can still see the screen clearly
also it must be removed every time you shut laptop screen down which i thought was ridiculous because i travel a lot with my laptop
the only good thing about this filter is the antiglare it provides for the user
however it is not worth  for it
i returned it immediately after i saw these flaws and will wait until m or another company can perfect computer privacy filters
i do not recommend i bought a privacy filter about  years ago and while i needed some protection for a new external monitor i figured it was time for an upgrade this new one should be better right
wrong
when i got it i literally compared it sidebyside and found it was not the privacy miracle some are trying to make it out to be
  the viewing angle was not better
both glossy sides tend to attract fingerprints
forget it if you have a touchscreen
i dont like the m logo etched into the corner of the filter
and the price and all the long wordy hype is not commensurate with the improved privacy it alleges
bottom line it does as good a job as other privacy filters not better and it doesnt have a mattefinish on one side like my old filter that prevents glare
save your money and buy another cheaper product
anyone who says differently isnt being completely honest with youjust buy a larger one that fits the margins of your actual computer monitor surface and trim it as you need to
the mounting tabs are more annoying than helpful splatted on the borders of my macbookthe tabs are meant for use with a laptop screen that has a bezel of some sort around it
the unibody macbook pro has no such thing being completely flat with its border so the tabs dont work
the privacy offered by the screen is adequate but im holding it on my macbook pro with m scotch tapedid not like this at all
it was not able to fit
it was the wrong size and it was latepros does effectively block sight lines from about  degrees glossy and matte sides to the filter to suit your tastes comes with two attachment methodscons when applied the screen has barelyvisible lines caused by the polarizing
nature of the beast but it definitely makes eye strain worse
if you just plan to use it during a flight though cant get much better than this of the two attachment methods one the clear doublesided adhesive is definitely worse
even when applied without air bubbles you can still see the strips and it gets annoying very fast
the other method adhesive tabs on the side is much less intrusive and allows the screen to be removed very easily none of the images show iteven on the packaging and directions but my filter had a inch semicircular notch taken out of the top
im not sure if this is a defect or if its intended to make it easier to remove the screen but its really annoying to have a little bright spot on the screen midway to the side of the screenthis does not fit the  macbook pro
you will need to purchase a larger size and trim it down with scissors
which will make it nonreturnable
so you better make sure you like iti wanted a screen that would provide glare reduction and thought that added privacy would be nice to have as well
however this filter is a big and expensive disappointmentfirst the one positive note  the privacy filter works fairly well as people seated to the side of the screen will not be able to see what is on your screen
however the filter does not sit flush against the screen so the image the user sees is a bit warped
its also going to add a lot of glare  reflection to your screensecond the glare reduction  this is a joke
there is noticeably more glare on the screen when this filter is attached
i see my own reflection about as well as looking in a mirror except worse because of the nonflat fit the image is warpedadditionally the screen is quite a bit darker when the filter is attachedoverall the screen may provide some privacy protection so if that is all you need this could work however you will have to learn to deal with increased glare a darker screen and the warped distracting glare  reflectionyes it holds my cf cards ok but batteries
maybe aa or aaa but not digicam batteries
my canon bps wont fit  period
i doubt my girlfriends nikon batteries will fit either
so i have a huge cf case
i guess its ok  hard to misplace and the size does cause me to remember to bring it
that said if im using my holster bag it wont fit insideah the search continuesthis is a well constructed pack with nice belt and shoulder strap but it didnt work for me
i bought it to carry my fz with lens hood attached
there are two velcro straps along the length of the internal walls of the pack to fasten the dividers
the lens hood caught on these straps when i would try to insert the camera in the bag making it a  handed and slow operation so i returned the bagi found this bag too clumsy to get in and out of quickly
it needs a zipper along the outside edge to give more unfettered access to the storage compartment
i kept it but really am not using it
i have been looking for another solution and havent found one i like yetmy daughter bought me the xs based upon the comments that they were great for football
perhaps the xs are
however i found the xs totally unacceptable for watching a game
the depth of focus is incredibly small meaning that items in front may be infocus but things a few yards back are out of focus
trying to follow a play was also impossiblemine were terrible
focus is impossible
focus adjustment is rough and sticks
if you try to fine focus you go right past where you want to bei thought these would be good binocs from the other reviews
the body is metal but the eyepiece assemblies are completely plastic
they warp and they are not quality
even the eyepiece lenses are plastic not glass
the main objectives are glass but the eyepiece lenses are plastic
thats not quality in my book
i wanted to send them for repair but pentax wants me to pay  and shipping to repair them
thats not a warranty its highway robberynever again pentaxi have tried both a dscp and dscp and have had the same problem with both cameras
i have owned a canon s for a few years now so that is my basis for comparisonif you own a dscpx you can try this test for yourself
try taking a picture of a friend indoors with low light
have the friend stay about ft away from you
when you view the picture on the computer youll notice that your friends skintone is very pixelated
this does not happen with other digital cameras
it definitely doesnt happen w the canon
i thought i had a defective camera but not anymore as ive had this happen with two sony dscpx cameras nowsomeone who has never owned a nonsony digital camera probably wont notice the problemi do admit that the sony is a great looking digital camera and it seems to be the only camera which allows for nealy unlimited full motion video
i really wish this camera didnt have the problem i just described because it would be my ideal camera otherwise
however the problem is bad enough for me to stick with my canon sthis cable was great while it workedi bought it about a year ago and it sat in one location between my computer and speakers
after about a year it developed a short near the  connection im surprised by the quality or lack there of being that its only been unpluggedreconnected maybe a dozen timesoh well  isnt much for a years worth of usei ordered this one which was suppose to be a  foot model
mine was over  feet so instead of returning it i just tossed it and bought a  foot mediabridge piece
the mediabridge model was so much thicker and stronger than this one which was really thin light and flimsyunfortunately too short but works 
its a cord 
the one you put in the phone
remember phones on walls doesnt work all the time
usually only one set of headphones works when using thisitem did come in as scheduled
i waited close to a month to receive my item
item came in a small package and was curved to fit in the package
once i connected  outputs i would get severe cracking and one channel would go off return then sound weak
i was disappointed and actually threw the item awayits good for the price but sometimes the ports dont work very well
sound comes out good on both headsets but occasionally have to replug as the sound washes in and outit works but headphones need to be seated exactly right in the jack for the sound to come through correctly
i end up needing to jiggle it quite a bit for it to work right and it gets disconnected very easilyi switched to the monoprice version which work a lot betterthere is disagreement about whether this splitter preserves stereo separation
in my case it does not
i wish id been one of the luckier ones but do you want a splitter that requires luck to work properlywell the item does what it says it would do it splits one audio jack into two but when doing this it also cuts the volume down  and i havent figured out how to fix it
if someone can tell me how i will change my reviewi bought these because i wanted to be able to have  headphones hooked up in the same jackit does work and yes it does put out in stereo but there is one thing everyone needs to knowthis jack drains the sound you receive in your headphones by atleast  percenti didnt know that before purchaseso i just wanted everyone to know
they are still very usefuljust dont expect full sound output
thats why i had to give it a  star ratingthe package it was in was well made and the actual jack is pretty well madei will prob need to find a jack that doesnt drain any of the powerbut for the moment these willdo and they were pretty cheap
so there ya go
i hope this review it helpful to someonewindows  does not recognize this as an audio device there for it will not put out audio threw iti bought this to be able to use my desktop speakers as well as my monitor build in speakers on my pcdoes not work
not worth sending it back for worked perfectly for the first week after i bought it
then i put it in a drawer for  months until i needed it again
the next time i went to use it i found that the sound would cut out unless regularly to wiggled my headphone cord in the jack
cant recommend it for longevitydoesnt work very well
could use some specific improvements like clearer sound no clicking noise having sometimes only one side working and not as bad of a plugin jack for the earphoneslet me start by saying that it does preserve the stereo at least for me
my big problem with it is on first use one of the female ports was already defective
gotta holdtwist it in stupid way so it stays stable
so im very disappointed
whether it keeps the stereo or not if one of the splitting ports is simply defective the item is uselessi love the idea of the splitter but this brand is terrible
unless i got a knockoff
it broke within three days of usei see that this has a good rating overall  but the one i got was bad
you need to keep the cord stable to get good sound
the headphone cord fits perfectly but still if you move it effects the soundfirst of all id like to start by saying that this product does in fact work however it does not work wellwhen connecting earbuds or headphones to this splitter you have to wiggle it a quite a bit until it gets in the correct orientation
the sound quality will be poor if you have it rotated the wrong wayi expect devices like this to be plug and play i do not want to sit there and play with it for a minute before i can use itthe audio works but if u turn the  mm jack the sound cuts off
kinda annoying
i ordered from bastexwireless
very timely for shipping but bewarei did not much care for this product
it seemed much too short for  feet
i guess if you stretch it full out it might measure the  ft  so i gave it awaytelephone cord is shorter than that stated on the label
i measured the cord be  ft only and not  ft as stated on label of package
i needed a  ft cord
the telephone cord however does workthis product probably works fine with a sidewinder joystick
however it does not work at all with the ch products virtual pilot pro yoke and pedals which is why i bought it
there is also no support or documentation for the productthe cable looks fine but when i print photos they come across a little jumbled on it because of the length  i expected better out of a gold usb cable  i used to test printers at lexmark and we had many cables that worked fine for printing at this lengthlasted about a week before the connection within the male end failed
sound wavers between the left and right channels
pretty much apiece of junk
back to radio shacki mistakenly read a review here stating that it fit mophie products
well i guess i found out the hard way that it does not fit all mophie products especially themophie juice pack air case and rechargeable battery for iphone  red fits att iphonejust so you knownow if anyone knows of a foot replacement usb that does fit the mophie juice pack air for the iphone  reply here pleasethe photo is misleading making it look like the product i wanted
in the end exchanging would have been too much of a hassle
so it lives in my junk drawercheap
you get what you pay for
lasted for about a year and then the plug came loose from the cable
if youre never moving the cable then sure its fine
but if youre plugging it into a laptop then it isnt going to hold up for very long as you plug it in and outthe picture of the blue cat cable is not the same as what was received
i specifically ordered this new cable due to the fact that i prefer the snagless protector
the items ordered is depicted as having this snagless protector yet arrived with the older less user friendly style protector
this may seem trivial if all youre looking for is a cat patch cable
it works fine like that
i specifically color code my network and want it to look and function in a certain way in addition to performing wellhad i been sent what i thought i was ordering i would be thoroughly satisfiedlooks like citi isnt the only seller pulling a bait and switch
i just received my cable from marginmart fulfilled by amazon
its an atlona cable with a new upc sticker slapped over the old one
the sticker says cables to go   the cable i received has a standard snagless boot  not the nice ctg snagless boot in the picture
really disappointing when you cant trust the brandpicturedescription
amazon should dump marginmart as a seller
no mistake here
they are intentionally sending the wrong cable evidenced by the new upc sticker with cables to go printed on itthis cable did not work when the cable was run in a bundle containing  cat cables to my gigabit switch
when run in the bundle with the cat cables this cable would only connect to the switch at mbps
if i took the cable out of the bundle and ran it across the foor where there were no other cables nearby then the cable would connect at mbpsthis cable even though the manufacturer says it is cat really only works for mbps ethernet catas ive noticed others saying the cables i received are not the cables shown or described in the title
they are just generic cables
bewarei bought   feet cables back in april
they appeared to work fine fine until this past weekend
i disconnected them to install a new desktop monitor mounts and clean up the cables to my computers
when i reconnected them after about  or  hours neither worked
thought it was a fluke
impossible that both should die at the very same time and for no reason
tried different ports on the router
different computers
nada
both of themi got three different colors from citi  ft modelthey were not as picturedinstead of a very flexible snagfree tab they had a tiny hard nob in its placemuch harder to release  it did release thoughno markings of any sort stating that they were cables to goi have others that are cables to go and they were as pictured with a flexible snagfree tab that worked greatbottom line is that citi sent a different item the cables to go as pictured are greati have an unreliable connection with this cable
it drops my connection from time to time
so its just sitting in a box unused
eventually i will probably cut the cable ends off and put new connectors on
no i would not intentionally buy this againif you are specifically looking for cables to go brand cat  cables look elsewhere
the cables i received from marginmart are definitely not cg but  they are cat   therefore although disappointed with amazon especially for letting this happen repeatedly i wont be sending them back because after all they are just cables and they are getting the job done
plus they were only like  dollars a piece which is why i give them  starsi ordered  cables and one was defective
it wasnt obvious and took me a little while to figure out as the problem was intermittent
i didnt bother to send it back or get a replacement since it was so cheap in the first placei was replacing a my old radio shack usb to serial because i cant get them to work on windows   i admit i didnt examine the picture in detail before ordering because in  years i cant remember having issues with serial cables
two serious flaws before i even plug it it it has a normal db end but it has these two big nuts which are unremovable
most serial ports are going to expect the cable to have male threads because these female nuts are on the device itself
i ripped them off but that takes off the whole end of the db which basically leaves a bunch of bare pins sticking with no way to secure the cable to the device this one is obvious
this thing is short
the cable is like maybe  which means its very likely you will need a usb extension to use it
i had to dust one off my old usb extension that hadnt been used in yearsthe good news is that when i finally got it connected windows  actually recognized it
problem is that i now have hacked it so much its not really a good long term solutiongoing to consider this a mistake and look for alternativespros drivers work windows recognizes device as a com port which was more than i expectedcons have to manually install drivers they say the cd will autorun  that is not the case it is not even set up to autorun  you have to guess the directory and installation file i was using this to program a pic microcontroller never had trouble via regular serial connection switched to this and it burned out my picconclusion for more standard applications this might work but since it burned out my ic there is clearly something that is not quite right with it
if you intend on doing anything that might not be mainstream with this id look elsewherequite simply this device will not function with any device that must see a true serial port chip standard  compatible uart
because the equipment i work with requires a true serial port chip my usb  db adapter is just an extra wire i carry with me for no particular reasonjust had for two day and then they stop working please buy an original one and do a favor to u and save money and timei got a usb cable but it wasnt one with the minib cable both side were regular sizes
the cable ireceived wasstill useable so i gave it two stars instead of onei received this product and sent it back because it was damaged in shipping
amazon gave me credit as soon as they got it back
i will try to order this againcame half the tabs on the covers broken not worth the effect to replace never againwhen i first got it
 of the cases where broken
the ups guy at work
but when i started to use it they are a bit frail and some of them easily brokemissing a ferrite on both sides as pictured
while it does show pin  missing in the picture i wish i had also seen that
 stars is for receiving an item falsely advertisedplus you might as well get the cheaper standard vga cable
i didnt see anything special about this one that deserves a higher pricei have worked in it for many years and have had good experiences with tripplite products
i dont think these are actually made by tripplite
the bag just said ebay on them and the tips do not say tripplite anywherei know thats not definitive but the poor quality is the other thing that makes me think they are not
most of what the other reviewers are saying is true
these do not click properly and have to be crimped a couple times to get really good connections
i will say that i have not had any issues with them not fitting in ports but i wouldnt be surprised
the only reason im giving these  stars is because they will make a connectionbottom line if these are tripplite they arent living up to the name and this is a classic case of you get what you pay for
spend the extra money and go buy some belkin tipsi used this cable for about  months every week or so
after only a month the clip broke off one end
i use cables to connect my laptop up to networking equipment and plug and unplug it very often so i was hoping that this cable would hold up but it did not
if you were using it as a static patch cable that got unplugged every few years it would be great but for my purpose it failed
i now use a monoprice cat  cable thats clip is guaranteed not to break

the signal was weak and made both desktop monitor  lcd tv jump blur etc i ended up buying an electronic splitter which works great
see my other reviewswhen attaching my laptop to my lcd monitor this cable gave an image shadow where all images and text had a phaseshifted shadow to the right of it
changing to a different and frankly cheaper looking cable fixed this issuei also originally bought this cable based on the good reviewsfor me the quality of the picture was not the issue initially but how long the cable works correctlythe first few months the cable worked fine and i was able to use my lcd tv as another monitor for my laptophowever over time something had gotten loose and now the picture is green
so i am guesing one of the color cablesmind you i am not hard on the cable and i actually never moved it after it was hooked upso you get what you pay for i supposedecent but probably will not last you very longthe cable i got was not like the one that is pictured on the amazoncom web page
the one that i got from the seller is of light gray color instead of black and looked to be of a lower quality model
since it worked well enough for my purpose and is relatively cheap i did not ask for a return but i was disappointed
it feels like being cheated on a cheap basis
i would not recommend this seller
unfortunately this was the only seller abacus listed by amazoncom for a  ft cable so even i had suspicions about it i had no choice but to risk iti bought these cables to hook up a computer to a projector
i knew i needed a high quality cable and hoped that these cables would work
i experienced serious ghosting on my display so i guess i need a better cable
the seller did allow me to send them back but by the time i pay shipping costs it comes out to be about the sameok so i first left a message in here explaining that the product is good for image but it doesnt reproduce sound i also said that the company was good very nice and fast shipment  no problem i was just trying to help others that were seeking the same as methe company contact me and asked me to erase my comment trying to fix my problem after i erased it they ignored me so i m leaving my comment againi wanted  pin cables
this was advertised as  but had only  pins
my system needs a  pin cablethey feel good the cable itself feels heavy duty and of good quality
unfortunately when plugged from my laptop to my  tv there are visible flickering lines
i thought it might be my tv or laptop but tried another vga cable my friend lent me and the lines were no longer there hence bad cable
i guess its hit or miss whether or not you get a good or bad cablewe got startech vga cable to watch hulu and amazon prime videos on tv and after about a year the cable just stopped workingthis item was purchased because it was advertised to be a startech  speecific application of a specific startech usb to db serial function was neededthe device that i received was an offbrand clone with a different chipset
the drivers included did not work i had to download several different versions from other sources before finding one that actually worked
had the vendor actually shipped a startech as was advertised this driver chase wouldnt have happenedbeware of cheap chinese clones masquerading as the real thingim running this on windows  x and arch x arch drivers were no problem however the windows drivers would not run files on cd and newer drivers from their website
i ended up finding drivers from china for these it ended up being for a hl all of these issues could have been avoided if prolific would publish inf files for drivers instead of executable that extract inf fileswhen i purchased this i was planning to use a vga monitor with a rather new pc that doesnt have a vga port
its something i didnt realize but the newer computer uses dvid as opposed to dvi and there is a difference
be sure to check before purchasing this
it should also be noted that this wont be used how one would expect
because vga uses analog signals and dvi uses digital signals simply plugging a vga monitor into this wont make it work with a newer computer if the newer computer doesnt support the old vga analog signalsi had purchased this to run from the ide optical drives at the top of my case to the add on pci ide card which sat in the bottom of the case
but it didnt reach for some oddball reason the drives plugs are very far apart and the extension isnt
so you can have your ide drives about a  inches apart but the end of the cord wont reach the bottom of the case
might be useful some day so ill keep it but if youre buying it to connect two optical drives in drive bays next to each other youre going to have a long length of this between those two drivestheyre okay but a lot of them are not perfectly even when you put the cd in
there is no way you can put cds on each side because the plastic would go updown
next time ill try another brandseriously of the  were ok to usethrew  of them away
almost every single one of these were bustedvery flimsy and totally unusable
it was like i threw money out the window
not pleased how i was misled by these favorable reviews for this productplease take into consideration this phone is  years old
but the buttons have stopped working no speaker no caller id nothing in the buttons work
also if you only have one line the line  light will always stay lit as if the line is dead and you always have a displya saying check line  there is no way to remedy this
i never was too happy with this so im now looking for another speaker phone and it wont be meridianaastrai am replenishing a bundle of memorex cd  dvd sleeves that i bought a few years back
the sku is the same    but the country of origin has changed as well as the quality
the original box of memorex cd  dvd sleeves was manufactured in taiwan
the original memorex sleeves are slightly larger as another reviewer has noted but more importantly in my opinion they are a heavier duty stock as well as a bright white in color vs a greywhite in color and flimsy sleeve on the current product that is manufactured in china
i am very disappointed in the current product and will be looking for a new manufacturei use these cases for pc backups
i do a lot of wedding photography and backup my raw format sessions on bdrs
needless to say they do not work very well for this purpose
the major problem is that they do not hold discs well
something as small as setting the case down on hard surface can dislodge the disc so it falls out when opened
never had this problem with slim cases until i bought theseive bought this item before with no problems
this time though about one in  have broken hinge pins and also some dont snap securely shut
ill try a different brand next timethe cd covers we purchased are poorly constructed and will break with the first use
there were at least a half a dozen of the fifty we purchased that were broken when we took them out of the box
recommend you spend a little more for a quality product rather than purchasing a cheaply made disk cover like this onethese are pretty much commodity items but the ones ive ordered before looked like the picture with a memorex box and branding
the ones i received were not packaged at all and had no branding
the cases themselves look the same but they may not be memorexthe gpu i bought doesnt work properly with my omnibook  the data in the external usb disk got lost
from the previous reviews its performance seems to be a random thing depending on the machine you havei was dumb and assumed i could use this to expand the imac desktop to a two monitor system
my fault for not decoding the word mirroring
anyway i plug it into the mac and connect a crt vga monitor that is capable of x and then turn on the mac
the mac now dumbs down its own display to x along with setting the vga monitor to that setting
for some reason the mac cant set the vga or its own monitors to good resolutions
i realize that what a cable looks like is more important to some people but how it and its computer operate is more important to meyes i know about going into the menus and changing the resolution settings yes i know i was expecting more of this cable than its designed for and yes im unable to find cables sexy so im not a true machead
but im writing this in hopes of making it clear what this cable does specifically with an imac and a crt vga display
pass the koolaideive had this camera for a month
i selected it for two reasons  the mm lens thread is the same as my nikon coolpix so i can share lenses
this works great
 the compact size  i mount it on the same rig as my still camera for dual shootsgood points compact light variable zoom works nice cool looking uses any mm threaded lens like the coolpix  can capture video directly to the mmc cardnegatives battery life
 minutes with the viewfinder  with the lcd screen lcd screen not as maneuverable as others itty bitty buttons
i have to use my nails or a pen
my finger tips are too big no accessory shoe to mount light or micreally bad negatives video noise
i was in medium light  not low light
a room with three skylights and four windows but no lights
grain grainy and more grain
looks like im shooting through a dirty window records tape motor as a constant highpitch background wine
this makes the audio unusable unless you recorded in a loud environment  loud enough to overwhelm the whine
nature shots quiet scenes etc
 unless you like a sound like an overloaded hearing aid in your audio youll want an external mic
since theres no place to mount it youll need the canon mounting bracket a separate mic stand or construct something yourself multi media video card
the manual states it works with any mmc card
the camera comes with an mb card  the capacity was too small
i purchased a meg card
it will not work
there is no help in the manual or site concerning mmc card capacity
i can only assume that higher capacity cards wont work
why did i want this capacity
because you can capture video directly to the mmc card
pop it in a card reader and you have web quality instantlyam i happy with it
well it was considerably lower in cost than the comparable sony and i can use my  nikon lenses with it
its small and compact
if i had to buy it again i would probably go for the sony if there was a  price differencei have a custom camera bracket so i can mount a light and mic
but adding these items totally defeats the advantage of having an ultracompact video camera  now its bigger than an old vhs camera
heres this little ultramodern video camera with two arms one with a mic the other with a lighti can live with the low light problem
but the audio quality is totally unacceptablefollowup i returned this camera
several sites that gave it rave reviews have yanked the reviews
dont but this camera
the oh look how small it is  cool toy wears off fast  especially if you want good video
i purchased a new sony insteadthey foam on the earpieces fell apart within a couple months
mediocere noise cancelling
id spend  for a good pair of noise canceling headphones instead of buying theseim not an audiophile and have no complaints about the audio quality
however i found the active noise cancellation to be less effective than i hoped
these headphones knock out perhaps half the engine noise
that still leaves a lot of noise
without these the engine noise was quite fatiguing and left me with a headdache with the headphones the noise is merely unpleasant and i can still function
there is a noticeable difference in engine noise level with the active cancellation on and off
other higher frequency noises voices etc are not quieted by the active cancellation
for these noises the jensens are no better than reqular passive headphonesi agree with other reviewers that the retracting switch is poor quality
requires a lot of fiddling  to push just right so the cord retracts
battery life is no problemive had these for a few years
i didnt want to spend the money for bose
they dont come close to the sound and noise canceling quality of the bose so know that going in
but worse the ear cushions disintegrated in a few years and thats with very little use and having them stored away from heat and sun all the rest of the time
thats unacceptable in my opinion
jensen should provide replacements for nothing
this is a case where you definitely get what you pay for
when i switch from nonnoise canceling to noise canceling the difference is barely perceptiblei was taking my old altec acs speakers home so these new ones were to replace them on the office machine
you would think that the same money amountcanadian  years later would get you something better not worse
the bass is farty and there wasnt any amount of mp player eq tweaking i could do to get it to sound even remotely as warm as the older acss did
very dissapointingmore memory is not better
this card does not work in most of our computers
its too big
didnt work in some celeron and athlon computers
try the k insteadthese speakers on definitely on the low end of sound quality
at a power rating of  watt per speaker they sound much smaller than they look
the sound is a harsh mix of the midtohighend range
there is no hint of bassbattery life four aa batteries will give you between  hours of play
while this isnt bad it also means that if you accidentally leave the power switch on youll be on your way to the store for more batteries
good thing there is an ac plug but no cableson the lighter side the packaging mine came with said that these could be used with a walkman cd walkman md walkman or pc
it then stated that walkman and pc is not supplied
rats i thought i was going to get a pc for twenty bucksand sometimes you dont
nothing wrong with the mouse on arrival
cheap and cheerful
several months on its tracking poorly and the cursor skipping
very fussy about what surface its used on mousepad is best and too much or too little pressure causes it to simply stop tracking
its either got gunkdust in the lens or a loose wire
whatever it is its not happy
at the price of a new one its not worth shipping back for repairreplacement
standard disposable itemtrouble is the two kensington basic usb mice i ordered at the same time are working perfectly still we bought  different mice to compare them in the office cost about  less and have vastly superior software particularly on the macs
id vote against this oneliked the mouse for about a month then the cheap quality material started to decaythe main problem is with the battery compartment the spring connection for the battery circuit will twist and become unusablewas constantly having to adjust the batteries to get it to workso i took a hammer to it and bought a logitech mx  which is fantasticmade with very good quality material and also operates with a rechargeable battery
microsoft needs to stick to memory hogging operating systems with tons of security flaws and leave the pc accessories to other companiestheres not a whole lot to say
at first it worked fine
but then and for no apparent reason the mouse wheels scrolling function stopped
i opened it up and nothing is broken it just doesnt work
i value above all reliability in hardware
a mouse isnt something i should have to buy every yearsome minor problems screeching sound developed on the left button after a day of useage
fixed by taking apart the mouse and put some lube on where the button contactsrubs the chassie
mouse wont power up unless i put a set of fully charged battery
my guess is that it has a higher oprating voltage requirement
fix charge battery before use or use alkaline
battery is hard to remove the door opening is just too small
you can easilly slide it in with an angle but very hard to do it in reverse
i ended up with my rechargeable batteries scratchednot that i care really skin on my hand some times got cought up between the mouse and the table surface
this sounds weird i know but if you take a look at some other logitech mouse youd noticed that the shape contours sharply inward the mouse body near bottom and that prevents this from happening
i dont know if this make any sense but compare those mice yourself and youll see what i mean
lots of user reports reliability problem
microsoft issued a recall on some of their ealier intellimouse so i dont really trust their stuff
a bit on the heavy side
i do get used to it overtime howeversome good things unlike some logitch optical mice this thing dont light up the whole room like a chrismas tree when you use it
the light output from the led is well covered by the nontransparent mouse body
i hate a growing mouse in dark environments
a very logitechlike buttonwheel feel and sound gives clear feedback
good long range
looks good
cheapbottom linetoo much hassle over a simple device
go with a logitech insted of this onethe device was used which i know is already stated
i liked the shipment time but wondered exactly why i purchased this item
i suppose the price shouldve been a little low for the quality
keep in mind though this product is rather obsoletepackage arrived broken
cables are not headphone size  these are large audio jacks
returned them will purchase smaller size elsewherecompared to mogami and monster these cables are a steal
in fact the only issue with them is that they dont last
the sealed ends mask the absence of quality in the connectorsthe most critical aspect of any cableand unfortunately within a few months of inputting removing inputting etc those ends begin to fail thus compromising the integrity and utility of the entire lengthfor approximately  cents  foot this is probably a decent purchase to consider versus the   ft prices for monster and mogamiprovided you are willing to consider these cables disposable and potentially a disruption at an unannounced timeyou get what you pay forthis cable was used to connect  my traktor s controller to my mackie mixer after a couple uses the cable started cutting out sound
i would have to bend the cable to make the sound work
i do not recommend this cheap cable long
overly long but i should have known
very weak cable it broke after a couple of uses with my silent violini bought these in a bind to do some audio recording for a postproduction project i was working on
it was barely usable
this cord has terrible static and nothing i could do fixed it
if youre using it for fun at home take your chances
if youre making money aka getting paid for a project use something much more reliable
overall could find betterive bought  of these and had issues with both
after cutting off the  mm stereo plug from one and replacing it it now works well
seems rather fragilei got these for some wicked new speakers for my video editing workstation
unfortunately the cables suffer from interference while using some software combinations
going to have to look into eliminating more linebuzz somehowquality is soso but it does the job
the connectors are all a bit lose and when the mm trs jack is plugged to cell phone or a laptop it is very lose and can be easily unplugged without using much force
accidental bump is a no gothe male end fits loosely into some inputs while barely fitting tight in others
when it works it works
however getting it to do so is sometimes difficult as it takes some jiggling aroundid say find another onecable worked fine for a while but then it got so the connector wouldnt make a tight fit and the right channel would go in and out
faili have had these adapters for a few weeks now and i cant say much good from them
the  mm headphone plug will not remain in place
simply holding the jack upside down will result in the plug falling out
fyi this issue occurred within the first few days of use with both adaporssound is decent but the connection is so flimsy that one cant even move while listening to musici guess you get what you pay fori bought a cable made from the same manufacturer and ended up having the same problems with it as i did this adapter
after a while the connector became loose and my right channel would drop if i didnt get it seated just right
faili ended up just buying another one of these plugs the adapter fit pretty loose and i heard a little noise when the cord shifted on my headphones i reccomend buying an adapter that costs a little more and save the hasslei have ordered these things from all over the world
this is the only one that cuts in and out and makes screeching noises
maybe i got a defective onedid not really perform as expected but i was cheap and bought a cheap adapter
for commercial use it is finei ordered  of these and both of the  ends feel a little loose
one is loose enough that the connection cuts in and out sometimes
the other one seems to be fine but considering how loose it is i never really trust it
maybe i just got a bad one but i would recommend staying away from thesei dont like them
i extended my wii video yellow cable using this and the picture doesnt show up some time
i have to fiddle with the connector to get the signal back and leave it at that position being careful not to disturb it
irritating indeed
my av cables are very good quality ones with gold plated connectors
without this bridge they work fine
i wouldnt recommend buying themi plugged this into my galaxy note ii and the fit wasnt snug enough
the sound kept crackling in and out
i have since switched to all bluetooth all the timeas with anything you should immediately test when receivedwhen i plugged this into a male jack then removed it i found that one of the two genderbenders id ordered had a female pin that would not stay in the connector shellbeing an old electronics tech i noted that the locking tab was deformed  poor quality componentsdue to the low cost i decided to send it back using amazons automated system and im waiting for a replacement nowits not that great
i thought it would be more heavyduty but the connections werent that tight
plus its heavyvery heavy which i should have guessed since its all metal
i would look for something with tighter connectionsthe female  connectors too loose cannot hold male jacks properly which create noise
anybody found better alternatives
thanks mine came with a broken right channel so i had to return and got the grado one
much better build quality with that one
i just wish it had the angled connectionget the grados they are better
i have both in a ab test you can tell the grado is a better soundthis is nothing more than vinyl hose that might be used on newer washing machines split down the middle
buy yourself some hose at lowes along with five zip ties and oila
save some moneyit is painful on the hands to insert the cables into the contraption and once you bind it all together its not much more compact than at the start
i would have done beter using zip ties alonei bought this instead of the ipod because it was so much cheaper
unfortunately i wonder if i got what i paid for
the user interface is clumsy especially while driving which is my primary use
the unit occasionally locks up and must be reset even though i stay current with firmware and driver upgrades
the size and shape is awkward and i dont care for the design
however it does work and i have packed it full of about  cds recorded at k
with my  ears compressed audio is fine for the car but it still doesnt cut it for home listeningit is nice to have  gb of music and  hours of battery life with an optional nd battery
but i couldnt get the jukebox to work with musicmatch jukebox and therefore was forced to used creatives extremely painful software
more painful was losing the ac adaptor
it is a v adaptor with a nonstandard connector
so you cant go into radio shack and get a replacementgot this the other day because of all the hype i read online about how great and loud it was
your better off with a logitech  or anything but this 
not magnetically sheilded so you cannot put it next to a tv without it feeding back 
bass is horrible  and distorted 
not very impressed at all 
would not recommend to anyone 
spend another  dollars and get something better fortunately i used this on my  samsung pc monitor before trying it on a samsung lcd tv screenthis leaves a lot of streaks you can see when the monitor is offfrom just about any angle
it does get rid of fingerprints if you are persistent with rubbing gently but then the streaks and ghostly splotches just spread all around the screennote that my monitor is matte screen
i have no idea how this might affect a glossy screen like the ultra clear used on the samsung ai still dont know what the answer is for cleaning lcd screens properly especially if they have gotten a light film of oil from normal cooking
most people have kitchens that open into the living room right
my tv is in the living room so over time  months or more it will pick up some of the oil that comes from light stirfrying and occasional broilingbottom line even though samsungs faq specifically recommends this product screenclean does a very poor job of cleaning
it leaves too many streaks and blotches
and what do we clean those off withif this is the best of the bestwell then theres a problem
i own a  inch plasma as well as a few lcds
this product failed terribly on them all
cleaning a screen becomes a major process with this product and you better bring your patience with ya 
basically this is not a cleaner it is a polishing cleaner
as many other reviewers have stated you have to polish a section over and overand over to get get rid of the streaks of doom 
hahaha
unless your screen is extremely dirty dont even bother with this
you will get frustrated and its not worth it
on the positive side though if you have a really dirty screen this product will work
you just better be ready for the job its going to take to get therei bought this so i could take the glass cover of my imac lcd and clean underneath because some tap water got under there and left some residue
so after cleaning with the solution and provided cloth i saw how many hundreds of tiny fibers it left behind
so after cleaning with the solution and the cloth i used the nonfibrous rag provided from apple
it was able to get rid of  off the fibers and clean the mineral depositsi would recommend that you use the solution with the provided rag then clean it off with a better quality ragthe product is fine works on all my lcd sony and ledsamsung screens
whats not so good is when you order this product it shows  oz
and what you get is  oz
amazon gave me a hard way to go to get this problem fixed
not the regular customer sevice i have come to expectthe monster screen cleaner works great on my pc monitors but on my new samsung led lcd it leaves horrible streaks
it must be because of the gloss finish to the screen but after spraying it down and wiping the screen ive noticed rainbow colored streaks all over
it easily take x the amount of wiping down to get rid of the streaks compared to quick wipedown of my pc monitorsi mean sure the screens look nice and sparkly now but heres what i didnt like  see the picture there
two towels are in the photo
it only ships with one
whatever  see that fancy lid on the spray bottle that extends the width of the bottle
that was not in my package for some reason  while it does clean it does not remove ink
the main reason i bought the best is because i thought it would remove the ink pen marks that my loving and sweet daughter so graciously put on my new  lcd
it doesntwhile i really didnt like those things it did make my ibm and my wifes mac laptop displays look supa cleansony warns that this player may have difficulty with some cdr and cdrw disks as well as with some cd writers
i happen to have burned quite a few disks with a qps disk burner on  different brands of cdr and none of them will work in this player without skipping a lot mp disks and standard cd format
the funny thing is that the same burned disks that have standard cd tracks play perfectly well on the the sony df and de portable players
go figure
anyways try to demo one of these with the media that you use or buy from a place that is easy to return things without a restocking fee
also sound level is a little low probably because sony doesnt include their usual selectable volume limiter on this modelit wont play cdrrws anymore
i dont know why
it just keeps spinning the disc really fast and doesnt do anything
i got frustrated and pounded it it broke
no cd player ive had has ever broken because of a simple hit
not even my ancient sony discman
i broke it
boo hoo
a waste  after  months use ive gotten more use out of my  year old discman
this thing really ruined my impression on sony
one time it spun a cdr for so long before i stopped it that it ripped the film off the top of the cd therefore making it useless
so disappointing
i hope not everyone has this problemif i were using a desktop computer that had a permanent home this would be a wise investment
but since i use a laptop and move it around with my wireless network its never practical to leave this sitting out set up all the time
and that more or less defeats the purposemost of the time its easier to circumvent this and go straight to the camera particularly since the dock wont work even just to transfer pictures unless it also has the recharging power supply connected toofor nonmobile users this is convenient but i dont think its worth quite what it costs
but if that convenience is worth the cost to you you cant ask for it to be better done
the dock is stylish and functional easy to use and gets the job done
all it really needs is to be priced a little more realisticallyive had one of these for a little under two years and when i had it i rarely used it
it holds so little music per minicd that i just kept burning the much cheaper full sized cds
now i have a flash based playerif youre really considering this
dont
look at one of the cheaper flash players
the minicds only hold  if i remember correctly and you can get a sandisk dap  for around  now sept however for a collector of odd gadgets and obsolete tech sure this is an interesting anomolypros  plays music in a standard format on standard discs no mtp or other proprietary systems to deal with
cheapcons  too cheap
old and outdated
limited format support no wma for example
oh wow
these things are still being sold
i bought one years ago when it was a brand new thing
back then it was good because flashbased mp players used the mtpstyle proprietary method of transfering files so they were a pain to work with not to mention that back then mb of flash was high end and extremely expensive
today you can do a lot better and frankly i recommend against buying this
ill write from memory what i remember i gave it away a long time ago
first it doesnt remember any settings
i cant remember where it left off and it doesnt remember settings like shuffle
that means that every time you start it unless you go through the  or so button presses it required to enable the correct shuffle mode it would play your music in the same orderto make things worse the displays do seem to be made more cheaply or something
i too had one where the display simply stopped working after about a month or so
while with most mp players a broken display is hardly fatal you need to hear a lot more than you need to see the fact that it couldnt remember any settings or where you left off and that it required you to go through several button presses to enable basic options such as shuffle made it become all but completely unusable since i wasnt aware i needed to memorize the exact key presses to do such things
if you want to play something in order this is fine but unless you rotate your discs very often going in order will get old very fastalso i recently tried to help the person transfer an audiobook to the player
in an effort to make the files fit on a single disc i elected to decrease quality somewhat
i used low bitrates mono and khz audio
all i got out was silence though
officially it supports sample rates from khz to khz so i guess it just wont allow monofinally if i remember correctly i would occasionally actually get skipping despite the skip protection
if i recall correctly it was certain vbr files it would skip on
i think i had the impression that it was primarily caused by files that could hit numbers like kbps bitrate and the maximum the player was perhaps made for was kbps
i may be mistaken about that but unmistakably whatever the cause was it had troubles with some vbr
either way my current modern mp player has no such troublesso i give it two stars
it is functional and will still work today  and its actually small enough to fit within a large pocket so even still has some convenience factor compared to a fullsized mp cd player
unfortunately it lacks a lot of modern features and the main advantages  the large amount of storage for such a small size at its price range  no longer apply today with flash based players hitting gb of storage and micromini harddrive players in the area of gb and costing less for the same amount of storagewhat good is this without wma capability
dont buy it
wait for one with wmaive not been terribly impressed with this box
dhcp has been flakey at best about half the machine in the house have required manual ip selectionat the least and the range of the router is ridiculously poor
at my fiancees old apartment my tibook could connect to the wireless networks of two of her neighbors at my bands rehearsal space i can get to the next apartment no problem ive been able to war drive
with this base station im  feet away from the base station and cant get a stable connectiontech support at least is reasonably helpful but i would definitely consider a different wifi router if i were doing it all over againi really wanted to like this router
its packed with features looks cool and was cheap after rebates
the setup was painless and i was working fine after only a few minutes
all was great until the wireless connection started dropping at regular intervalsi work about  feet from the router  walls and maintain a  signal
at least once an hour or so the signal quickly falls to zero for a few seconds then returns to normal
unfortunately i use a vpn link to my office and a signal drop of even a second kills my link
i then have to close my applications and log back on to the office
thats very annoying
i could accept some interference causing a drop once in a while but at least once per hour or more is unacceptabletoo bad i liked this router otherwise but i sent it back and will try netgeari had this setup for a total of  days before i was ready to throw it out the window fortunately i was able to send it back to amazoncom
setup is the pits range is terrible since you have to be right next to it for the card to have a connection and there are better more affordable productions on the market netgear
good luck to you if you are brave enough to try thisi bought this router and the dlink card
the set up was easy and it worked fine for a while
but after every couple of days i had to reboot it
i found later that a firm ware upgrade would obviate the problem
but why should i need to upgrade firmware for the basic functionalitymy recommendation would be to go for a tested  mbps
most people do not get internet connection over  mbps anyhow so there is no bandwidth you are losingalthough this device worked out of the box with my laptop it didnt take long to run into issues with other machines
the desktop machine i was trying to get it working with was running win and wasnt getting an ip address from the router
after an hour or two on the phone with a somewhat rude techsupport person he didnt know how to solve the problem and decided it was quota microsoft issuequot and gave me an  number for themeventually we decided just to reformat the machine and throw xp on which was good for other reasons and got the router working
at that point we learned that the router wasnt compatible with novell vpn software even though they claim they support it
after a  hour conference call with both dlink and novell and the novell guy knew more about the router than the dlink guy we still had no solutionthe final solution  i went out and picked up a netgear wireless router
everything worked great including vpn on all boxes in  minutesthis uses a ti chipset which ti refuses to release any information about to the linux driver writers
thus it is unlikely to ever be  linux compatible
it seems to work okay under windows xp but i try not to support jerks and you can get a much faster wirelessg card for not much more nowdays so its definitely not recommendedi have made  separate attempts of trying dlinks wireless cards and both times they failed miserably
this setup isnt worth the hassle
the connection is terrible setup is a nightmare and there are better products on the market good luck to you with this piece o messtech support could not help switching laptops did nothing
a replacement dwl showed the same symptoms
i then decided to buy a cheap wireless vcnet mbps card  and it has never ever lost the connection to the router the signal is consistently stronger now i can use it in the back yard where as the dlink would drop to a red connection and within seconds lose the connect entirelyjust a waste of money go with a no name brand they work fine
the dlink router di or better does perform brilliantly thoughafter reading all of the reviews i had high expectations for this camerawhile the menus are very complicated and seemingly needlessly so they can be mastered
but the camera  doesnt seem to  be able to easily retain settings despite following the manual as closely as possible
battery life is quite short despite not using the lcd screen or flash and i couldnt find anyone that has additional batteries in stockother issues involved the cameras failure to connect to my computer an imac although nikon help desk couldnt figure out why
my previous digicam a canon a has performed flawlessly and in fact took pictures as goodif not often better at the same outdoor event as this nikon
i am not a highend professional nor do i think you should have to be one to produce superior results with this camera
i bought it specifically to be able to control the exposure more ie
shutter speed along with a reduced shutter lag
so far im disappointed on all counts even allowing for my lack of sophistication when it comes to highend digital photography
the lcd screen is almost unconscionably small which is housed in a much larger flipout panel that could easily accomodate a larger one
to me this is an indication of the haphazard approach nikon has made with this particular camera having had no other experience with nikon previously
i strongly recommend you try this out in person and then make sure everything works before any time elapsesive owned this camera since it first came out in  and since im not a qualified camera expert i want to give you my thoughts on this camera
im giving this review as someone who is relatively new to digital pointandshoot photographyfirst and foremost study the nikon manual
then study it some more
the controls are overwhelming at times provided you are a neophyte like myselfsecond for exterior photography on the normal setting this camera cannot be beat
it is exceptional
the images are clear clean and colors are spectacular
ive photographed nascar at the california speedway and other events like the coronado speed festival etc and the outdoor shots look great
now for the indoorshootingthis is where the camera gets its two star rating from me
i do not know how to select the manual control onthefly
ive tried to set up controls to shoot indoor photography but i dont have weeks and weeks to learn the settings
ive photographed people who are standing completely still slightly moving my kids low lighting conditions fair lighting conditions and still cannot get proper images to come outthe indoor photography is pitiful as the colors are yellowish muted and nearly  of the time the images are all blurred
the popup light is only good for  feet at best
i took some special shots of people who were stationary and it appeared that the photo looked good when zooming in and out with the control
when i downloaded the cf card to my pc the images were always blurred and the colors were way offmind you im not a camera professional like many of the reviewers here but rather im just an average joe who would like to have decent indoor pictures that looked natural and were not blurredi would sell this thing on ebay if i could get more than a few hundred dollars for it but ive already invested over  for the snapon lens adaptors and protective lens cover which keeps the retractable lens from getting damaged
i bought this from a company in canada back in all in all im happy with the exterior photos but am very very disappointed with indoor pictures
i guess this thing requires a lot of tweaking and many many hours of studying the little manual that nikon has providedi would stay away from this and save your money for the newer digital slrs
ive had this for over four years now and just wanted to write a review based on my experiences with this camerajust a thoughtim bringing this camera back in exchange for a coolpix  tomorrow
the camera is well built does produce high quality sharp pictures and has a boatload of features however the autofocus is horrid
the autofocus doesnt work correctly in anything but bright sunlight
if youre shooting inside under slightly darker than normal conditions the autofocus just hunts
its very frustrating when you miss shot after shot because the camera is struggling to autofocus
if you want to stay with the nikon name check out the   its a far better performerthis antenna does pick up tv signals but the additional features do not workthe cable  antenna video selector switch does not work
i was able to use this unit with an antenna signal only
i could not switch back and forth between cable and antennathe onoff power amplification switch also does not work
it did not have any effect on signal strengththe coax cable attached to the antenna is hardwired and cannot be replaced it is  inches long
the f connector on the cable just pushes on instead of securely screwing onmaybe its sedona az but this antenna drew in only  channels and those gave very poor receptionthis antenna did not work for me
granted i live in an urban area
but i did not pick up one consistent channel
its also very directional so even if you live in the country you have to continually change the direction based on what channel youd like to watch
pay a little extra for a higher quality more powerful antennawithout any antenna i got most of the broadcast channels most of them are very grainy and sometimes very ghosty
the tv even with its builtin amplifier did not improve reception much one channel became very clear the others actually developed more ghost images and an extra wb was pulled in  also quite grainy
overall the pluses and minuses cancelled each other outi live in downtown seattle surrounded by buildings on all sides but id hoped for more improvement
the performance of this antenna was no better than a cheaper one like the jensen  that one also had exactly the same effectsi had this camera although is adorable and it felt as if i was a james bond movie person it took horrible pictures
the inside pictures if it didnt have the right amount of light the camera would not take pictures at all and when i took pictures outdoors it woould have a blue outline around the imagesthe saying you get what you pay for is very truepeople who rave about this thing either work for the company or are vision impaired
i bought one on a whim so i could take it with me on vacation
i can honestly say that of the s of pictures i took with it not one was a keeper
the shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless your pictures are blurred
i found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures
the camera quotcrashedquot often and i needed to take out the battery to quotrebootquot it
this happened a lot
the camera worked in sunlight but pics taken indoors were way too dark
this thing is not ready for prime time
not even at these pricesvery short range reception
tried this out on the interstate and could only receive when other radios were within  mile maxrange is too short to really be effective
wouldnt purchase againi tested the cobra hand held cb on california rt
 today
not so good
tuned into truckers channel  for northsouth traffic and heard mostly noise
there was very little discernible language so i squelched out the noise and waitedand waited
i called out for a radio check and got a comebackloud but not clear
the speaker in that hand held cb is awful
its abrasive to listen toit is my opinion that the short  inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speakerthis cb radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road
perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying
i was looking for a portable system for temporary use but the cobra hh road trip cb is pretty poor
personally i wouldnt buy it againthis unit worked well for what it is a handheld cb
i was able to transmit and receive greater distances than i expected over a mile and the sound quality is okay
after  months however the buttons on the side of the unit for changing channels no longer work at all
i can get to ch and ch with the instant ch button on the front of the unit but the only way to get so a different channel is to scan and hope it stops when someone is talking
i am very disappointed with cobra customer service as i was told i am basically sol since the limited warranty is rather limitedin sum i am now debating between getting another hhroadtrip like this radio and hoping the buttons remain functions or trying a midland radiobose seem to elicit a passsionate response whenever their name is mentioned and i will try to elaborate on my experiences and let the reader decide if these speakers are right for themi currently own a set of bose acoustimass speakers that i purchased from a friend
the speakers were in excellent shape and i felt lucky to be able to afford bose a few years ago on my meager salary at the timethe speakers are definitely room friendly they blend in easily as their size is unobtrusive
that said after investigating speakers recently for a planned theater upgrade i now feel that they are lackingwhen i first got my speakers i compared them to a pair i had purchased back when i was in highschool
i didnt know anything about those speakers at the time but was happy with their sound as wellar holographic ms
the results of the comparison left me thinking my ears were deceiving me my old speakers sound better
anyway i put those thoughts away thinking that i must not understand because obviously bose were the best
fast forward a couple years all the while the bose were up front in my surround system with the old speakers in the rear
that whole time i had no issue with the bose they performed well enough
after buying a new tv i thought it might be nice to upgrade the speakers so i would have the same brand in the front and back
and so began the researchi spent time listening to number of speakers including high end and mid level brands at custom shops as well as entry level speakers at best buy and circuit city
i have now come to desparately desire replacing my bose speakersthey just sound thin which oddly enough was my initial impression the one i thought i must not understand
that is the best i can describe it music on the other speakers just sounded fuller like it had more bodyi will freely admit i did not know what i was missing until i sought it out but now that i do i feel that my bose are no longer good enough
i will also say that this is not based on cost i listened to a number of speakers that sounded much better at the same price although they are not the same sizein conclusion i was looking for that fuller sound willing to devote the floor space to much bigger speakers in order to get it
some people might not be willing to make the trade of size for sound but for me it was worth iti have a mcintosh amfm tuner with a ferrite loopstick for an am antenna
i get a few stations fairly well but my favorite station comes in with a background hum
i tried the terk advantage in hopes of improving my reception
but whether i just placed it next to the tuner or attached it by the wires it did not make any evident difference
i really wanted to like it but it just did not work for me so i returned it
thanks to amazon for their return policy
it is a real confidence builderthe antenna is made pretty well but it does not make much difference in most cases ive found
you have tune it for every station which is very difficult because you have to not only position the antenna correctly but also manually turn a control
the difference is just not worth the effort and mine is collecting dust on the counter
walk away from this onei didnt have very good results with this antenna but i havent had better results than with the simple telescoping antenna that came with my seti expected a little better based on the strength of the reviews but not real surprised when it wasntback to my original antennai have tried this antenna many times camping
i have tried it in vermont the lake george area of new york and connecticut
it never pulled in more than  stations and they were always full of snow
none of the stations ever came in even decentthe only reason i give this antenna  stars is because without it reception was even worse
but it is still pretty worthless in my opinioni will try this antenna again once i get a digital converter
maybe that will make a differenceclever design for use with and without stand
that it connects to your television or converter box via old design ohm flat wire results in a weaker signal than should be expected from any modern indoor antenna
i loved the loop antenna for uhf
it made me think of the old days of blackandwhite tvshort cable to link to digital converter or tv
slighty flimsy aerials one of which broke within  daysdoes not perform very well in my city location even though there are plenty of freeview channels available sf cathe setup im using this with a tivo remote  the transmitter is on one side of a standard wall from the receiver ft away
the receiver is in a dark room with all the sensors arranged in front of the tivo the transmitter is also in a fairly dark roomusage ive found that the response is very sporadic
sometimes itd work perfectly sometimes id get doublekeypresses sometimes id get no response at all
i found with the noresponse instances waiting a minute or two seemed to reset synchronization between the sender and receiver and then itd work fine for a while again
im pretty sure its not an issue with the remote itself as i also use it to control the tv directly and have no problemscant recommend itpurchased this pda from amazon and they are fantastic with service
and was happy with it till i had to use it at my fatherinlaws home with very poor lighting
couldnt read the screen
im returning it and at this point am not at all sure what ill use to replace it
probably pen and paper for awhilei went from a handspring visor platinum to this clie and now almost regret itpros screen resolution is twice as sharp and gorgeous nice sleek metallic casing documents to go is already included allowing you to view and edit word  excel filescons screen is hard to read except under bright light so you have to use the backlight more often which burns batteries much faster the handspring had much more practical features for business use such as datebook plus and expense tracker documentation is incredibly useless so you have to dig around the online website which is only a little less useless so you have to use the  help number which is ok if you can stand the hold timesalso the clie is loaded with a lot of memoryhogging software that you cannot removefluffy flaky junk like photo viewers movie viewers memory stick drivers camera and mp apps
why anybody would want to view photos and movies on a monochrome screen escapes mei can understand that maybe some users will actually use these but why cant those of us who dont want to use them remove it
i guess thats wy they call this an entertainment organizerprobably fine for video games and other fluff but not really geared for the business usershould be called the bimbo pdalooks great but not much elseyou wont see the screen since it is not backlit
dare to light it up and you will change batteries every time you turn it on
as it is it already devours batteries like the devil
typical example of something cheap that ends up being costly
jsony had a good thing going with their cx megachanger
unfortunately they tinkered with it and the end result is a nightmare
gone are the eight music category buttons you could use to quickly categorize each music cd
gone is the speed of the earlier units  this unit takes almost  seconds to change from one cd to another and about that long to initialize after it is poweredup
gone is the ability to change from continuous to shuffle or one disc play to all disc play modes while the cd unit is playing you must now first stop the unit before changing modes
worst of all this unit scrambles the link between artist names and their associated cds
sony is aware of this problem but cannot fix it and officially denies it exists
we should know  weve been thru four of these units trying to find one that works as advertised
none of them doyes this unit will play mp encoded cds
big deal
mps on a cd player are prettymuch worthless since youve no way to control the music selection within a given disc no artist or album select options within the disc
also you cannot view the track title for the disc on this cd player until the track cuesupsave your money
reject the sony cxnothing amazing as far as a remote control
the macros are nice but can be lived without
it was a solid remote for  months or so then buttons started failing one by one until it was impossible to use and i had to buy a new one
buyer beware
oneforall only offers  days limited warrantyunfortunately they are no longer manufactured memorex
this was not compatible with several of my components and the learning memory was far too small
not recommendednice remote nice idea upgrade didnt work
tried cell phone  different phones in the house and a pay phone
they said the fact that i had digital phone made a difference so i went to the pay phone that didnt help either
i even tried a second remote from best buyno luck
check the web site first and make sure the equipment you want to use it with is already programmed into the remote
learning also not a great option because it cannot store very many learned functions
the component i was trying to get an upgrade for was a directv receiver dforget that one
spend a little extra money on a logitech harmony remotedont buy this one first and end up needing to upgrade a few months laterwell i wasnt as taken with this remote as some of the reviewers
maybe i just expected too much from a  dollar remote
its probably a case of getting what you pay formy problems this remote does not have any of special buttons found on almost every remote these days
cable remote features missing no a b c or d  the favorites button is tied to the remote and its ten channels
its not set when coded to the cable button to use the cable favorites
this is a serious design flaw
no page up or down button
other remote buttons missing no eject button
no audio settings for theatre systesm
ie
the auto detect button and the select buttons up and down
the coding on this remote really was lame
i had a previous version from oneforall and that remote had codes for my sony theatre system and my sony grand wega
the new remote listed those same codes but when picked the remote says not found and the codes for the tv only one code for sony tv the pip buttons dont work at all
the reciever code is the same as the old remote which worked fine but with the new remote every button works corretly except the one i need the most the one that turns the theatre to the dvd source
old remote  ok  new one equals no go
remote does not work my toshiba hd dvd player at all
no joy whatsoever
the learning memory is ridiculously limited
another fatal design flaw imopsummarythis remote would be very nice if the memory was larger
since many of the buttons for cable remotes was completely missing you have to use your limited learning slots for basic remote functioning
this coupled with the small memory is a fatal flaw
i have to go back to the point you get what you pay for
all in all its very easy to use this remote but severely lacking in basic function buttonsno remote should come these days without  a b c and d buttons programmed in the basic code of unit remotes as well as page up and page downoh yes there is no seperate battery for saving of memory so if you pull the batteries to change them you lose your memory and have to start over
with all the learning needed to get functionality another fatal flawspend more i guess i am still looking for a better remotei bought this unit a couple of years ago
it was great
i recently got new equipment and went to site to call to upgrade codes but the phone numbers given on the site and in the manual are not availabledisconnected or old and i used the one on their site
so what good is an upgradeable remote when you cant get customer servicethis goreous remote is likely to fill any need you might have for controlling your entertainment center replacing all the other remotes in your house
cd dvd tv and cable are handled here so theres no real problemno problem unless your device is older or special and requires special programming instructions
this learning remote fills the need at least theoretically but repeated calls to the maker yielded no results
moreover the instructions as stated had no effect on my gear making this purchase costly and annoying
this lack of support is at odds with the broad promises
its especially frustrating when you consider how wellbuilt and elegant this remote issome programmable remotes have an autoprogram feature that finds your devices for you without pressing a long series of codes for each device
i wish this remote had a feature somewhat like that or at least the sort of help that would make this usablei have a urcn device remote that i have been very happy with
its powerful emitter manages to outperform the oem remotes that came with my yamaha receiver and motorola digital cable box
however it doesnt have learning capability and i am wanting to put my equipment out of sight so based on my happy experience and the glowing reviews i decided to give all  ones  a try
after working with it for  weeks here are the negatives i have discovered
its ir emitter is not nearly as good as the n
i normally sit about  degrees off angle from my equipment at about  ft away
i have to lean forward to get the equipment to respond to the  i dont with the n
the rf commander is about ft directly in front of the equipment with an unobstructed line of sight
it sits to my right about  ft away from my chair
i have to press the same remote keys several times to get it to finally beam the command to the equipment
i suspect that either my x remote control system wifi wap or cf light bulbs are causing interference
which is disappointing
it means not a lot of effort has been put into the rf system in this remote to filter out interference from other common sources of rf
the last annoyance is the key layout
i didnt think it would be an issue until i started using the remote for a while
the n places directional pad and the transport controls the ones with the stop play pause ff rwetc
all at the top of the remote
the  separates these controls with the dpad at the top and the transport controls at the bottom
when using the guide on the cable box the chapter forward and back keys are used to page up and page down
i dont have to shift my grip on the n to go from the dpad to the pageuppagedown
the  i have to make a major adjustment and with the weight of the  its heavy in comparison its a trick to do with one hand without dropping the remote
learning limitations arent an issue for me so i didnt encounter it
i can see though that if you want to customize the remote you have to have some programming experience to do it using a jp cable and software
ultimately i will be retiring this remote for something more robust in the ir emitter area and more convenient in key layout
i wouldnt recommend this remote
its not worth the priceupon receiving this remote the first thing i thought i  would teach it to do is to operate my tv a sony hdtv
its a common tv so i should have no problemwrong
the remote wont even controlselect the video inputs you want to use on the tv such as video video etc
therefore using this remote to select different video sources such as dvd satellitecable etc was impossible and i had to go back to using my sony remote
next i have a bose lifestyle  system in which you can have differently coded remotes to control sound in different rooms of your home
even though they say it will control a bose system it wont or cant control a bose system which goes to different rooms of your home
when i ran in to the problems i opened the owners manual to see if there is a support number to call
there is no support number and no one to call
if you cant figure out the problem by using their web site youre out of luck
these remotes are cheap and you get what you pay for
unless you are trying to control any more than the most simple components my advice is that you definately avoid this and all allinone remotes
we may look in to the harmony remotes but for now and after this experience if we want to control the tv well use the tv remote
if we want to control the dvd we will either use the dvd remote or we may teach our tv remote to control the tv and dvd player
using this remote does not simply your life it only complicates and frustrates your life and once you buy this remote you still have to keep all the rest of the remotes on your table because this remote will not do all of the functions that your other remotes can do
also bewarewhile this remote is advertised as a wireless rf remote it does not control wireless rf devices such as a satellite or cable receiver as your rf remote does which came with the device
rather the universal remote sends a wireless signal to its own infrared transmitter and then your device which was previously controlled by its original rf remote now receives an infrared signal from the universal transmitter
got that
these remotes do not control your rf device with an rf signal
rather they control your rf device by sending an infrared signal to it
so just when you think you are simplifying things by getting this remote youre instead adding more things and plugging more things in just so that you can get this universal remote to operate your rf operated equipment
bottom line if you want to keep it simple use your tv remote to control your tv use your cable remote to control your cablesatellite receiver and use your original dvd remote to efficiently control your dvd player
instead of pushing buttons to select which remote you want the universal remote to be simply pick up the appropriate remote and use it
keep life simplepros nice loking soft red backlit light
may work well in some select situations
cons poor brand compatibility
inability to control two or more tvs
bulky heavy
contrary to their claim its not really a learning remotefirst its incompatible with our dish networks dish  receiver
second its incompatible with our apex tv
third the remote code for our signature tv didnt work
knowing that it was made by sharp ive entered the sharp tv code and it worked
isnt it their not my business to know thatits not really an device remote control
it might be if you have both satellite and cable tvs at home but not too many people have it
and neither satellite nor cable buttons can be used to control anything other than that
dont have both cable box and satellite receiver  its only device control
dont have a standalone cd player with remote capability  its only device remote control
etc
etcmost frustrating is that they chose to ignore so many millions of satellite tv customers
and im not going to struggle with their upgrades over their paid not toll number which some reviewers said is hard to get through doesnt work with dsl filters cordless and wireless phones all of which i use
instead i am voting against the manufacturers ignorance by returning their productoh almost forgot about the learning feature on this urc no you cant teach it to learn to become a remote control of a device for which theres no code available
there are only  four separate buttons on the remote which allegedly can learn only some select functions of some remote control units
about  years ago my mitsubishi remote control unit was able to learn almost any function of any remote control
is one for all regressing when everybody else is going ahead in the st centuryi bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be
no more equipment in the tv room
about two weeks ago though i noticed that the unit was slower and slower and i had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done
it has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all
at first i thought it was batteries in the remote so i replaced those a few times
then i thought the placement of the ir transmitter was off so i moved it closer to my av rack
that worked at first but the problem persisted so i reprogrammed but to no avail
eventually i narrowed it down to the remote unit
even with the remote right next to the ir transmitter it now does not work most of the time
of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room so standard ir remotes why do they even make those still
are out of the question
i will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossedalong the way i learned a few other thingsother reviewers are right in that the memory gets eaten up quickly when you have to program the unit which i do with a new lg dvd player
in theory this is a great unit and the remote is very good when it comes to commands
in practice however all it did was make me hungry for an rf system that will work more consistentlyive used this model router for many years and until recently ive been happy with it
it provides excellent protection from internet malware and hackers since it has network address  translation nat and stateful packet inspection spi
the problem is that the latest one that i bought tends to need rebooting totally cold start  power off to get it to connect to my computers
other than that i have no problems with it but that one problem causes me to lower the rating to twostars
if not for that id give it five starsits too bad that dlink discontinued this model rather than just fixing the reboot problemi dont like the fact that i was refused technical support because dlink considers this an obsolete product
i set up the product and could not get back on the interneti bought the dlink di just because it was lessthan a comparable linsys dsl router
i always knew that linksys is the better network equipment makerthe router was extremely easy to set up
it truely was
i have never set up a router in my life but these things usually come easy for methe thing about the router that i absolutely hate is where you plug in cables
the cables do not stay put
you constantly have to plug them back in
i have multiple brands of cables and none of them stay in
the router was not even moved
im wondering if the router just loses the link to the cable and not lose the cable physicallyand another thing the router constantly disconnects from the dsl modem and does not reconnect to it
i have to restart the router  times per day
sometimes it has nothing to do with the modem
it seems that the router is incompetentnot recommendedstevethis unit has the typical features found on other similar router nothing about it stands outthere are however quite a few flaws
in an effort to cut cost dlink made this unit very small and it is constructed out of the cheapest plastic you can find
its so light in terms of weight that when you plug in the power cord wan port cable and a couple of lan port cables the unit would not sit flat on the table
the cables would exert enough force to tilt the unit
the spray painted on silver color would peel and chip after only a few weeks
there are also quite a few firmware bugs but some of them did get fixed with newer revisions
update of firmware is however very tricky the file browseapply options dont always work as they are suppose to
furthermore resetting of the unit would reset the time to april  
april fools
the buildin ntp support wont sync up the new date and time automatically
in theory this unit might be more advanced than early dlink products but the build quality dont come closewatch out
i sent in my rebate information and creative only credited me for  not the  advertised above
needless to say i complained
i was eventually sent two rebate checks of  each a day apart
i have to wonder if i would have gotten the full amount without complainingsoftware is very poor
it locks up repeatedly on my windows xp machine
the usb driver does not mimic a drive so you cannot simply drag and drop files onto the player
includes a substandard mp player for your computer with no equalizer
cd ripper downloadable from creative will not do variable bitrate
nomad iic drivers for windows media player do not appear to be available on the web anymore
to top it off the uninstaller doesnt remove all of the registry entriesmost of us have good software to play and rip cds already
all i needed was something to transfer mps to the player
instead you get an integrated system of bad software that fills up your hard drive and doesnt work half the timei was able to load the player with music once and it seems to play quite well
unfortunately i have failed to duplicate the feat since
fortunately notmad red chair software recommended by another reviewer is fully functionali have used this card with an  mp dslr for the past five monthsit has been reliable but memory writes to the card are too slow for anything other than studio or landscape photographyactually bought four of these cards with the camera
am going on a trip to france this fall and will be replacing all four with faster cards before i goread the technical specs for this card
write speed is not even listed  that is a hint
tregraves lent trop lent aucun allez  very slow too slow no gosecuring the nikon binocular to the harness was complex and time consuming
one cannot just casually pass the binoculars to colleagues once you are wearing the arrangementive owned dozens of audiovisual products and remotes
this panasonic is incredibly frustrating to use because the remote and the front panel controls are the worst ive ever seen
nothing is intuitive and the playstoprewindforward buttons on the remote are about the size of grains of rice and are difficult to find among the sea of buttons on the remote
the playstoprewindforward buttons the ones used  of the time  make the bloody things larger than the others and easy to find
the remote isnt backlit either and to activate the buttons youve got to mash them all the way downchanging discs is a pain too
sometimes it just doesnt want to no matter what you do with the remote
changing dvds at the unit is maddening too
id go into it but id be writing all day
oh the manual is horrible toothat being said once you get the thing playing the disc you want it to the picture and sound quality is really goodi bought this to replace my old cd changer and thought id get dvd as a bonus
unfortunately its design as  a multifunction device makes it a poor choice for playing cds
a bad ui and frustrating useability finally caused me to return it
 too long to startup you must wait through a  second boot up cycle while it scans all discs ignoring the play button until a small cryptic indicator on the front panel indicates its ready
only then can you press play
 no autoplay unlike my old cd changer you cannot program it to start playing a cd at power up
you are forced to wait through the entire boot cycle in order to manually press the play button
 no automatic sequential disc play after the boot sequence you must press the dedicated sequential play button on the front panel  you cannot set sequential play from the remote
 no disc skip button on the remote you must know which disk is currently playing and specifically select the next one
 remote is too small too many buttons clearly dvdcentricon the plus side the cd audio quality was good and the picture out of the svideo port was great although on the  dvds i rented there were always some sections on the extra features tracks that glitched during playbackin short i could only recommend this product if you dont have enough room for  dedicated devices and need multifunctionality  otherwise take the same and buy advd and acd changeryes i recently got the h error code too after almost  years
i recently bought a sony and is much happier with it in term of remoteeasy of useable to read many dvd formatsive used a previous generation of the powershot and really liked it so we picked the a for an upgrade
what a waste
the interface is confusing but worse of all is getting it to actually take a picture
push down the button and itll make a noise like its working on the picture but watch out cause it didnt do it
what its doing i have no idea
autofocus
anyway it only took a real picture one in five times of trying
sometimes i had to hold down the button for  seconds to get it to shoot
extremely disappointing for canon i expected the next generation and got something worse than our  canon cameraafter putting lots of efforts to program it it worked fine though still not perfectly
at least partially work with all my devices
until one day i notice the lcd is not as stable as it was
it dimmed after i push any button
i immediately realized the battery is out of juice
i put a fresh pair there and then i found all the programming was lost
i need to reprogram it
i still remember all those programming pain and i gave up
i just fall back to use my  to  remoteswhat attracted me to this reader was the great price and its features
installation was straight forward
even before rebooting i could see the addition drives appearing on windows exploere
then i notice the intermittent floppy disk access
my floppy drive kept coming on every few seconds as if it was trying to read a disk
still the reader worked fine at the point
then i started getting the blue screen showing usbatasys being the culprit
now i leave it unplugged when turning on my pc and plug it in only if i need to use it
i am working with their tech support trying to resolve this
because their support is weekdays only no weekends or evenings i can only call them during the day at work then try something at home and call them back the next day
its very tedius process
if i dont get it resolved in a few days id probably return it
i am running windows  with sp on a dell xps t with  mb ramthis is an interesting device
i bought three of the original versions a year ago to hook my tivos up to the rest of my home network
in general theyve worked well
however when i tried to use one of them with an old win laptop ive got the software wouldnt install
it said something like the os wasnt adequate even though the machine and os both meet the requirements
emails and phone calls to linksys resulted in nothing
no response
that was ok since i was merely experimenting
but now a year after i bought them and conveniently just after the warranty expired they seem to be failing
two weeks ago one of the plebrs just died
no lights or anything
i replaced it with the new version which seems to be working fine
today another of the original boxes stopped connecting
all the lights on the box indicate that everything should work but no network traffic goes through
if i replace the box with the new version i bought two weeks ago everything works fine
so since i cant find an alternative means of connecting my tivos to the internet it looks like ill end up buying yet another plebr
hopefully these new versions will last longer than the old ones
this is getting expensivei bought this several months ago to use with my slate tablet when i wanted tohad to use a keyboard
for awhile it generally worked although the keys are very gummy and you need to press them very firmly when typing
but thats ok  whats not ok is that after very light use the keys for all numbers other than  and  have stopped responding along with all of the corresponding shiftkeysparenthesis the at sign for email etci cant type them because im using this piece of junk now
you cant appreciate how irritating it is to work without number and the other keys until you are forced to do it
stay away from this virtually useless producttried both android tablet and ios tablet with the wall adapter plugged in and my laptop plugged in no charging
kinda defeated the purpose of this product for mehave one of these hooked up to my airport extreme router so its single usb port can accomodate a printer and a hard drive
worked great until the other day when i realized only one of the little indicator lights was on  all the ports but one are now dead
tried disconnectingreconnecting and no dice
ive been using one of the larger dlink  port hubs separately and its always worked fine so i bought this one to supplement it
maybe i got a bad one but im still out  bucks for a dead hub i got to use for maybe a year and a halfid like to give this one  stars but ill round down due to how quickly this unit died on me and others i have read about on the interwebs
its nice and compact with a vertical stubby charger that is better than most of the powered hubs wish theyd learn to make the brick separate from the prongs but oh well
ports are tight together almost a little too tight but that is not uncommon for a port hub
the pricearound is reasonable for a name brand portthe problem i had with this unit is that several times in the past it became unrecognizable to windows  though it is fully compatible
however last month i had four devices that stopped working and refused to be recognized despite no trauma to the unit no voltage spikes or no kidinduced tampering
the unit which had been wonky a few times in the last year completely died
i tried a new ab usb  cable tried a different plug and heck even tried everything in another location on a different computer
still the same result
dlinks customer service on this unit is a joke so dont even bother
thank goodness i bought it with my amex blue cash card and got a yr rather than just yr warranty
buyer beware and it wasnt just mei bought the apc port usb  huba vertical one with  front ports and  rear onesand it works fabulously and is  cheaperi got this hub because my pc is  years old and has  usb ports total
this day and age thats not enough
and since my pc is kind of out of the way i thought this would come in handy when i want to charge or transfer data from my samsung epic
unfortunately it cant do that
i have my keyboard and wacom tablet running to this hub and they work fine but as far as transferring data im stuck
i can get as far as my dcim folder but once i try to open the camera folder it hangs
if it ever gives me a file listing it wont open the files
so i unplugged my phone from the hub after trying the other ports on it and plugged it into my computer directly and my phone worked fine
what gives
ive had dlink products before and theyve never let me down before
but this hub failed me on the one thing that i wanted it for
unfortunately i cant say that it doesnt work since my other devices can work with it
but if your planning on connecting a data device like a phone or ipod its buyer bewarei will never buy a dlink product againfyi im running win   bit premium edition  gb ramif all you want to do is to connect basic usb devices that dont need power then this works fine  ive had one for years and its worked without problems except read belowhowever if you have a device that needs power such as a usb hard drive then this will not do it for you the drive will likely squeak at you without connecting to your computer
since i am able to charge some devices with this my conclusion is that the power provided at the ports doesnt meet specs required for the higherpower devices such as disk drives
im not an expert on usb specs but you can do your research if this is important to you
im going to have to throw this one away and replace itnote  i have a similar device i bought from another online merchant monoprice which works perfectly for all the applications
and it was actually a bit cheaperso i recommend against buying this model
why not get an item that will do everything at no extra costwhat did i want
a usb port that the usb cables or its own power source would not pull off my deskwhat did i get
better but no cigarwhile not yanked off my desk like those ridiculous ovoid models that need to be adhered to your deskwhich i dont want to do to youstill not heavy enoughit looked substantial
it looked like it laughed at the cables so hungry to pull it to the floorits not
it barely sits therei dont need a bricklead gold or otherwise but i do need more than this thingplease someone for the love of all that is holy make a usb port that has some hefti have had this port hub for a couple of months now and am using it with an imac
its performance has been erratic
i had all my peripherals plugged to it  printer camera keyboardmouse and my ipod sync cableit worked fine for a couple of weeks
then the keyboardmouse started failing to detect on startup
unplugging and replugging would solve the problem but it was not worth the trouble for every time
then the ipod refused to sync through the hub
so now i am back to using the ports on my computerso im not happy with the product
either i got a bad piece or mac users should stay away from this usb hubim unhappy because i was a believer in dlink
i have a dlink wireless router that has been working flawlessly for over  years nowfollow up i contacted customer service and they sent me a replacement that has been working well since so i guess i just had a bad part nothing to do with computer compatibilitybulkyi utilized the dlink dubh usb port hub for a little over a year
previously i owned their combination usbfirewire workhorse hub for almost ten years without a single problem so i didnt hesitate to entrust dlink for a full usb hub
 months in one of the plastic widgets that held the usb plug in place fell out without it the plug hole is useless
a few weeks ago another plastic widget fell out
now i have only  usable holes outlets
note that it was not abused in any way it sat in back of my computer undisturbed
way too expensive to have something fall apart so quickly
looking for a new usb hub but sadly it wont be a dlink
really disappointing note
the new model shown is all plastic
guess they changed styles but amazon is displaying the later modelpurchased this to charge an ipad  while also using it as a usb hub for a computer running win  for some reason it will not charge ipad when the hub is connected to computer as intended
as soon as i unplug the usb cable going to computer it starts charging
dont know if others have same issue but i should have just bought an extra apple chargerthere needs to be a disclaimer in the sales information on this hub that owners only find out after reading the manual in the packagethe full power to charge an ipad and other high amp usb devices only works on the last two black plugs and only work when the computer is off or if you disconnect the entire hub from the computer
periodthey do not work for full power while it is plugged into a host computer
how does this make sense
perhaps it is a usb standard
but i bought this hub specifically because the sales info states that it provides power to charge an ipad there was no asterisk or disclaimer does not work while plugged into computer that would have swayed me from buying this model
other than that it is stylish  be sure to buy some velcro stripssquares or adhesives if you play on putting it anywhere
almost like a joke it has rubber feet on its bottom the power cord and usb cord to the pc that it comes with are so rigid they will knock it right off a desk because its so light weightdlink dubh high speed usb  port hubive had this hub for  months
hooked to an imac it started good
ive lost one port at a time and im currently at  functional port on this hub
it should have done better when the new hub arrives it is going straight into the trashi wanted to use this as a usb charging station
it has enough power but it only provides power to the output ports when it is connected to a pc but i only have laptops and dont keep the laptop near where we charge everything
this flaw makes it suck but aside from that it seems okit worked fine at the start but within a week individual ports ceased to function so far 
although i have populated all the ports most are not in constant use camera gps palm pda sdreader
seems like this should be able to handle all of this
amazon replaced it but im still worried that the new one wont be any betteri have had reliability issues with the product since its arrival
regardless of how many items i have plugged in  most times when i boot my computer either the mouse or the keyboard was not picked up
if i unplug that device and plug it back it it works fine
i called dlink and they said they would not replace it unless it had similar issues with another computer
it did
however considering the cost to me to send the item back this was not worth it given that they could not guarantee that the next one would work
i pushed dlink to reimburse me for the shipping if they found that my device was in fact defective but they refused
i will buy other brands in the futuremy biggest complaint is that the ports seemtoo small
its very difficult to plug in my usb chargers for the ipad and iphone   once you get them inits almost impossible to get them out
you have to wrap the cord around your hand and yank on the cord
im afraid that my iphone  cable will break  and you know how much apple charges for a new oneanyways other than that its not charging my wireless logitech headphones or my xbox  playncharge controller
why
just charge iti didnt test any of the data capabilities i pretty much got it as a usb power strip
and its failing
requested a replacement from amazon in case i got a bad unit
well seeupdate got a replacement from amazon
it has the exact same issues so its a design flaw
ports are too small and the only ports that really charge an iphone  and ipad are the fast charging ports so only two of them of the seven actually do any good for me
requesting a refund and sticking with my two star reviewits really annoying how it works
i have it pluged into my macbook pro retina and only have a keyboard and my iphone pluged into it
when i awake my macbook it takes a couple of seconds before i cant start typing and im usually in a hurrythe other thing is when i close my laptop to put it to sleep the phone stops charging and starts to charge again
sometimes other times it wont start charging and i do have the powered hub connected to a light outleti have to keep unplugging it and plug it back up to make it work
sometimes i have to do it several times just to get it to charge my iphone
i bought it for the main reasons to charge my iphone quick and have back up portssometimes when i have the computer on sleep and try to charge my phone it wont charge it unless i unplug the usb from the laptop connecting the hub and laptopi understand it has something inside to switch between the power of the laptop and outlet but it doesnt work right in my opinionthis hub worked fine and was easy to set up
some how after about a month it quit working at all
anything connected to it would not function
the only things i had attached to it was two printers and a gb thumb drive
i just installed the replacement hub different brand so we will see if this goes south after about a month note    the following is my review for the port usb  hub
i originally reviewed the port grey styled usb  hub which is discontinued and replaced with a black styled one with different features however they are listed under the same product code on amazon
to make it even more confusing amazon has combined the  port usb  hub into the same item so i can only write one review to cover all of these things
i will leave the original review lower down but if you are interested in the usb  hub then this review up top is what you wantthis hub has been really flaky for me
most of the time it doesnt recognize what i plug in
in order to get it to work i have to jiggle all the cables around
i dont know if its the cables that are loose or if theres something loose inside but its a real painthe hub has purple leds in it which only serve to annoy me
im not  years old i dont need my equipment to look like a circusalso the ports are upside down
seriously this is really silly
yes there is a top and a bottom on usb plugs but i guess dlink didnt get that memothis item gets two stars because it didnt catch fire and i can sometimes connect devices with it now here is my original  review for the port grey usb  hub which is discontinued  i gave it  stars back when i wrote that review  originally titled works well if you dont overload it i like the way this hub is styled i have to say that much
functionally it gets a passing grade and frankly if you grade it on a curve against other brands it does very well indeedit works quite well as long as you dont overload it
the supplied power adapter provides va which if you do the math is only enough to fully supply  ports with power
real world it supplies even fewer than that
so this will work well for you if only some of your devices require bus power but if a lot of them do then you will have problems
i have  ports loaded up with a mix of poweredunpowered devices and it works
but if i try to plug something into port  it rarely works just not enough juiceyou could probably fix this if you sourced yourself a different power adapter but lets face it that would probably cost more than buying another huball this being said im still going to buy a second one to supplement my first one because quite frankly it seems like most of the other brands of port hubs are worse
at least this one is perfectly reliable if you dont overload it no overheating problems no random droptousbspeed problems no disappearing device problems again as long as you dont overload it and it doesnt look terrible on my deski have terrible luck with usb devices and this is the first hub ive run into that comes halfway close to working properly so despite the flaws this one is worth consideringi love the look i love the little blue led and love that it is powered enough to support  large external drives thumb drives my mouse receiver and iphone by problem with is is that it wont charge my ipad i understand that not all usb hubs can charge an ipad but then it shouldnt be advertisedvery disappointed  i should have gone to the dlink site to get detailed information
i purchased the unit hoping to both power and expand a raspberry pi  turns out that the  charging ports only supply a when the hub function is not usedi bought one hub and it works great
i bought another hub had problems and exchanged it for another hub which had the same problem
i ended up returning the second hub and buying another brand
the hub has two modes one for fast charge green led when it is not connected to a usb port and standard blue led when it is connected to a usb port
the problem with both hubs i returned was that they would stay in fast charge mode when the external power adapter was plugged in whether it was connected to a usb port or not
in fast charge mode green led i would get random io errors over time  minutes when using these hubs
in standard mode blue led i did not have these problems
i tried swapping cables and power adapters with my good hub and the problem persisted therefore the problem was in the hubs themselvesthis is a nice small inexpensive hub with clear instructions
unfortunately it does not seem to work with macs as advertised
when i tried to use it with my imac g it would not work with powered usb devices hp laser printer powerwave and ipod
my cameras download cable worked ok but i didnt buy the hub just to plug one device in
i found a web page online that suggested other mac users have had this problem with the hub
but neither the dlink web site nor the apple web site included any information about the problem i hadmore expensive than other similar usb hubs
it looks better than some other ones but there are multiple compatible issues
many devices wont work with this hub
for example my webcam will constantly connect and disconnect with it and my mouse cannot be detected by windows this is the particular bluetooth adapter that apple recommends
and it works about just as well with macs as it does with pcs which in my case is not so well
i have motorola phones that work seamlessly with my minimacs with built in bluetooth but the same  phones using the same software do not work well at all using the external dbt adapter on a gthinkpadwhitebox pc in fact i returned it due to its poor performance
it may be the motorola phones are a bit tricky but there is no point in having an adapter that doesnt work for its intended purposei just purchased this and found that i had received the c version
this version will not wake your mac from sleep mode
im going to return itmodels with versions of b through b are not affected by this issueheres proof from applei bought this while back and just upgrade to vista recently
vista recognize the adapter but has no profile for it
went to dlink website and i didnt see a vista driver
email the customer service
they kindly responded me too look in to a page that has all the vista for dlink products see if its in there
noo
option  try xp drivertrying is not my job
i bought the product i expect it to work
oh well if you plan to upgrade to vista or already a vista owner
this adapter has no offical drivers for it as of feb i own this mouse first then just bought another one logitech wheel mouse optical
logitech is clearly the better choice at a comparable price
its logitech more responsive comfortable accurate better feel better look  unless this microsoft one is free go get the logitechthe pointer doesnt move smooth like regular mousei bought this mouse and used it for about  months before i started having problems
it would only work intermittently stopping for a few seconds and then re starting a few seconds later
this would repeat about  times a minute making any work impossibleafter consulting the microsoft help files refer to  microsoft knowledge base article   and trying some of their fixes it seems like quite a few other people have had this problem i still could not fix the problem
i ended up buying a logitech optical mouse and havent had a single problembefore buying a microsoft mouse ask yourself how often does my microsoft software crash
do you really want to buy their hardwarenote that im reviewing the value not necessarily the quality of the productthe powershot a that i used this with has excellent battery life with lithium or rechargeable nickels so while the power adapter works well its not worth it unless youre doing a lot of shots or are doing a lot of flashintensive work from a fixed location near an outletfor about half the price though this product would feel much more justifiable for a purchaseone of the ear cushions tore while i was putting it on my headset even though i was handling it carefully
the material is too thin so when i tried to stretch it a bit over the earpiece a goodsize chunk came off
ended up throwing them awayi ordered these to replace an ear cushion for a plantronics headset
ive had it for a couple months and have been steady trying to put this earpiece cusion on it
unfortunately i cant get it on
that really sucks
i really dont know if its the covers or the headset that somehow dont match up to the model i have but ill keep tryingthis quick disconnect cord was purchased to replace one that was misplaced
wed bought the first cord along with a plantronics headset and both had worked excellently for several months for my wife who uses the phone many hours daily in a sales situation
when the original quick disconnect cord was misplaced we purchased the exact same model as a replacement even paying nd day shipping to get back to full function quicklywhat a disappointment and waste of money
whereby the first cord and the headset mated perfectly and worked without flaw there have been consistent sound quality problems since starting to use this second cord
there are no visible problems with the cord and i eventually tried some spray contact cleaner as i connected and disconnected the quick disconnect plugs of the cord and headset to see if that would help to produce a robust connection
the issue with poor sound quality persistsfortunately we found the original misplaced version of this cord a couple of days ago and thankfully it still works flawlesslyso two versions of this same cord two distinctly different results in functionality andor quality
while the confort and sound quality of the plantronics headset has been a blessing for my wife im not sure wed order this combination again due to the variations in quality with this cordi purchased this for my mother in law who could not hear the phone ring
the ringer does have a volume control as well as a slider on the side to adjust the tone but it is just not that loud
about as  loud as a regular telephone
i was looking for loud and just did not get iti purchased this headset to replace a vxi passport headset that i have used and loved for years until the dog chewed it up
i work from home and its important to me to have a good analog headset while i am making calls and unlike the vxi headset this one just doesnt work well without purchasing an expensive amplifier even though its supposed tomy customers kept telling me they couldnt hear me well and after less than three hours use i put it back in the box and have not used it againi thought i could save a few dollars in purchasing this headset which is half the price of the vxi passport but basically it was a waste of money since it doesnt work welli bought  of these for my office workers and we were all getting complaints that people couldnt hear us and sometimes we couldnt hear them
most of us quit using the headset after a couple of weeks
i think one person is still using his
maybe if our office wasnt so noisy i would give a better review it just didnt work well for usto muffled people said i sounded like i was at a distance or in a tunnel
i will not be getting these for our officethis headset although is at a great price  did not work with the avaya  i think it might work with a cisco phone or a home office phonei purchased this product in  at our local costco store
at about the five year mark of ownership the modem needed occasional reboots due to dropping from the internet
i recently had to replace it with a linksys modem due to more consistent drop offs like weekly instead of every few months as prior
the installation is somewhat of a pain having to use an cd installi also have noticed over the time of ownership that this modem is always very warm to the touchno problems fast and cheap until exactly  year
then slowly kept dropping more and more until it never could establish the connection
not a great choicedespite what other reviewers have said this outlet covers both outlets unlike what many reviewers have said
i purchased mine in february  otherwise i guess its okay  well see with use if it does what it sayswe had a lot of fluctuating voltage a during the hot summer months
i used on on my refrigerator but my refrigerator circuit board  still got  destroyed
i used on my microwave
still had to buy a new microwave
used on on my stove
every morning i noticed that the clock on the stove blinking which tells me the current got knocked off and then came on again a few minutes later
used on my computer
the computer cable got knocked out  but the computer was ok  had to buy a new cable
so i am not sure that this thing really worksbought  of these
had to work very hard to get the buttons working
finally got it working but not sure for how longi bought this charger  months ago
it came with  kodak  ma nimh batteries
after a few months of light use the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as  ma batteries should
if i use the batteries immediately after charging them i can take about  pictures while my  ma nimh batteries can do 
if i charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves they wont be useful after only a weekthe charger is capable of charging both aa and aaa batteries
but a few months ago  spring for switching between aa and aaa stopped working properly
this was after very light use
i only charge aaa batteries once a monththe market for nimh batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago
i would not buy this kodak if i were to buy todayi have two of these chargers that i bought directly from kodak for about  each
each of them came with  aaa batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package
one of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use
battery charger technology is not all that complicated but kodak doesnt seem to have mastered it yet
no wonder they were practically giving these away
id avoid purchasing these now at any pricethis was the wrong cable for the right purposethis was not correct cable for what we neededcorrect one ordered from another source at a lower priceold rs cables use to have  conductors for all  pins of the db connector i guess new ones only have  which works fine for modems but does not work for electronics that require all  pins to communicatea bit of a let down how thin these guys are
the metal where the threading is on the case stands up slightly and the plates are thinner then this which leaves them jiggling around
i tried using two but found that these paper washers i had laying around from something else i bought worked better to secure them
startech please make them thicker even if it results in a  pack
id rather have the right productneeded a parallel port card for my computer to run my cnc router
the card needed to be able to support epp mode but this card offers no way to actually set the mode
unlike a motherboard equipped with a parallel port you can set the mode in the bios settings
this card is automatic detect only which means its worthless to me because it wont function with my breakout board unless it can be set manually to eppwaste of time and moneythis fan was exactly  x  x mm and fit perfectly into the slot that my previous fan used
the four corner holes also lined up perfectly
i didnt need the adapters since this plugged directly into the three pin post on my motherboard
it was whisper quiet on startup and remained so for a couple of monthshowever after  months it began making a buzzing sound that changes in volume
it hasnt died yet but its getting much louder
its time to shop for another onethis stuff is only  silver and while it does an ok job im getting nearly  degrees centigrade lower readings with arctic silver  on something as sensitive as your computer its more than worth the extra few dollars and lack of amazon prime for as i bought one of these from amazon and it worked well for a while
then when id switch back to the windows machine windows wouldnt recognize the usb ports on the switch
id have to unplug all the cables from the kvm and then replug them to get the switch to work again
tech support tried some fixes and when they didnt work arranged to have a replacement sent out under warranty
the replacement unit has problems losing keystrokes on the linux system
so im back to the original box while i wait for yet another replacement and also look for a more reliable kvm brandi bought this at the end of may so that i could use one set up with both my desktop running xp and my laptop running vista
connection was easy
everything was recognized on the first try
i had absolutely no problems with the desktop connection
it was the laptop that proved to be a problemon the laptop i was going from a in display to the display on a in monitor
the resolution on the laptop was x
on the monitor is was x
after a bit of tweaking i finally got the laptop connection to display on the monitor under the correct resolution
this worked for a couple of weeks with no problem
after that couple of weeks anytime i switched from the laptop to the desktop and stayed on the desktop from longer than mins the laptop connection lost the correct resolution setting
i reset them but again when i switched to the desktop they were once again lostafter going back and forth for a while and setting and resetting i found that if i made sure the laptop was the first to start up the settings would hold
that worked for a while
i even tried connecting the monitor directly to the laptop to make sure the settings were correct and then connected the kvm
again that held for a whileeventually it became so frustrating and time consuming i removed the monitor connection all together
sometimes the only resolution i could get on the monitor through the laptop connection was x
whats the point of a in monitor if the best resolution i could get is xanyway after a couple of months of sharing nothing but the keyboard and mouse even that began to fail
either one or the other failed to be recognized by the desktop upon switching over from the laptop
i often had to unplug and replug the usb connection to get them to worki had the same issues using two different laptops
at beginning of october i disconnected it completelywhat put me off on this item is the way the ports are configured
my keyboard video and mouse cables are preinstalled and not compatible with theirs
so this item is sitting in my spare parts bin along with its cablesso i loved these when they first came out and we used them in the d for several projects
during one of the events the drive developed a strange noise and shortly died midshoot
not a good time
the noise was rather like an old turboprop plane starting up speeding up and slowing down
we were unable to salvage any data off itwe got that one replaced under warranty and the new one arrived and worked fine for about  shoots before succombing to an early death just like the lastwe currenty have the third one in and it is working fine but we now have three  gig lexars in spare because we cant count on these on critical applicationsas random storage i suspect this is probably ok but if you need to not lose the data look elsewherei bought this product as a gift for my daughters and they now have them so i can not tell you how they are but from the looks of them when i was wrapping them they looked like they might help see the key board of laptop a lot better especially in low light as for the fan without trying it would be hard to be able to say how it worksthank yousandra ayotteso i needed some easyaccess usb ports for my desktop without having to go under my desk to plug something in every time i bought the port usb pauhu
one other reviewer claimed their cord was nearly  feet but mine measures  feet long which was barely enough to reach to the top of my desk
the cord to the computer has two usb plugs one of which is conveniently colored red and labeled power
the main shortcoming here is that this is a port usb hub so i expect to be able to use at least  ports right
but no i plugged into three ports and my ipod starting freaking out disconnectingconnecting back and forth until i just unplugged it
meanwhile my file transfer from a flash drive died halfway through and when i tried to recopy the files the thumb drive folders were all missing which reappeared after i removed it and plugged it in againalso even if it was the only thing plugged in out of  ports my western digital passport would not connect to the computer
yet it works fine when plugged straight into the computerso i guess if you are looking to connect flash drives only this might work okalso beware amazon seller adorama camera wont accept returns if you open the blisterpackaging that it comes inso slow to use
you get what you pay for
invest in something with more speed and youlll be happy
this product wasnt worth it
i dont use it and its in a junk drawer somewhere waiting the next purge to goodwillthis is a nice little hub but lacks usb and also its would have been nice to have a power adapterthese speakers continuously go down in price
i looked at the system and asked myself why would a  watt system with  thx certification continue to drop in price if its as great as everyone says it is
because it isnt as great
the satellites function as well as any other highpriced digital system clear highs solid mids no distortion
the bass however is another storysure its powerful  but too much bass comes through the satellites distorting any other sound youre trying to get
not to mention the frequency range on the sub is horriblemost systems in this category sport a bottom range of  hz while this one bottoms out at  which is embarassingeven worse these speakers will not do it for partiesof any size
pushing this system even remotely close to its max power will result in your sub dying instantly
even fiddling too much with equalization will kill your sub  i turned up the bottom frequencies with my ampless mixer and the sub had issues with lots of popping
the second day i owned this system the sub was dead  and i hadnt even pushed the limitsbutif youre a nonsavvy home user who just wants to be able to hear big booms from their movies have it it
just remember  you get what you pay for
everyone else kick in the extra cash and go for altec lansing swhich hold up admirably in every category these fail ini bought this because i wanted to have a wireless trackball for my laptop when im lounging in my recliner
there are really only two wireless trackballs available this one and a three button logitech model
i went with this one because i like having the additional buttonsthe device itself performed flawlessly but the effort to try to learn to use it was much too high for me
trying to use your pinky to do right clicks while manuevering the trackball with your ring and middle finger was next to impossible
also since i had the trackball on the arm of my recliner pressing the left button with my thumb tended push the unitsince it is on the side and when you push it you are applying horizontal force to the unit
as has been mentioned in other reviews the scroll buttons are in oddly uncomfortable locationsall this was enough to make me dislike this device but the pain i started to feel from the constant manuevering of my hand and fingers was just too much
i felt like i had to contort in unnatural positions to get the buttons to work
i simply gave up on the idea of rightclick and drag all togetherim returning the unit and getting the other logitech wireless trackball that is more of a standard thumbball device
id rather not have the added buttons and get a more normal deviceif you are truly interested in this unit i would suggest find a place where you can try it out before purchasing it
many people may like it but i found it completely annoying and i wish i had been able to try it before i bought itwow i have a logitech optical mouse and it works flawlessly
i bought this and quickly noticed that the scroll wheel doesnt always work
sometimes if you scroll down even at very close range nothing happens
then if you scroll back up itll go down or if you scroll down again itll go down twice as fari sent it back and amazons great service sent me a new one
it has the same problem
i count eight buttons on this thing the software is good but not great
one unreliable feature ruins it for me though
id keep it but the scroll wheel just keeps making me mad work darnit
no scrollwheel would be better than one that works sometimes or in the opposite direction that youre trying to scrolli bought this cordless trackman to put in my officei have two optical trackmans not cordless at homeive been using them for more than  years nowthe placement of the ball does feel awkward theball sits in the way of your middle finger
afterlittle use it started to give me wrist pain
thetrackman wheel has the ball under the thumb whichis far more comfortable
ill let you know if iget used to this new setupthe draglock button is stuck it does not clickafter a little bit of inspection i found out thatit has been pushed in by the transparent packagingill be returning this one for an exchange
i hopethis is not a common problemi really wanted to like this device but it makes it very hard to do so
it is well designed i like the size of the ball but the button placement leaves a lot to be desired especially the main button left
there are two things logitech must improve
first this thing is a battery drain which is expensive and environmentally unsound
second its interface to the computer mac os x is strange
many times the behavior is as if the left button is continuously pressed it would attempt to drag objects i have no interest in dragging and so on
this device will end in the trash and i will buy a new trackball from another manufacturer
other less important irritants are erratic pointer movement and the fact that it does not work well in direct sunlightfirst i am a huge fan of trackballs
i am still using a trackball logitech trackman marble mouse that i purchased in  after talking it to war in iraq in the desert
it still works like a champ
i bought this wireless one to use with my boxee box as mouse navigation is really slow on the device
the default tracking sensitivity is so low though that the ball was way to unresponsive
i believe you can fix this with windows settings of the software that comes with the mouse but that does not work for boxee
beyond that i am not sure why they changed the ergonomic design so much from the logitech trackman marble mouse
i found this design to be bulky the wireless receiver is large and the trackball did not feel comfortable
also i found the button placement to be awkward
for me i do not think my comfort would be improved with more use it just felt rather carpal tunnel inducingman i was so excited to order this thing to use as our media center input device because a mouse on the recliner arm sucks but the wireless range on this thing use just awful
as soon as the trackball was more than  feet from the receiver it would start skipping around everywhere and it was completely useless at  ft i was so impressed with thelogitech vx nano cordless laser mouse for notebooks  mouse  laser   buttons  wireless   ghz  usb wireless receiverthat i ordered a year ago it works flawlessly past ten ft that i thought this would definitely work since the transmitter was  times as large but no dice
im sure it works really well right next to the receiver but it does not work as a media centertv mouse replacementmicrosoft stopped making the trackball explorer mouse which in my opinion was the best trackball mouse ever made
they are still available on ebay but at  a pop
i went to xp  bit and the microsoft mouse drivers have a major bug which cause my computer to get the bsod so off to finally finding a replacement my old trackball explorers went to ebayfirst let me say that this in not even close to a replacement for the microsofts trackball explorer but it was probably never meant to me
i gave it a full weeks try but my brain had a hard time adjusting
the layout is not natural for me
i could not lay my hand on it natural and be productive
i had to move my hand up on the mouse and cramp my fingers to make it work but that was not comfortablei ended up with the logitech trackman wheel
it has taken me a while to retrain my brain but my hand lays natural on it and works fine plus it is about  the pricethis trackball is a big disappointment in many ways largely because the ball and the leftclick button functions work poorly and are very imprecise
overall the layout of the buttons are not conducive to real comfortable use if you use it heavilyall day
this product is definitely not worth the  fee for itlogitech is generally a good brand and most of their mice have proven sturdy and longlasting
this seems a bit flimsier than the old marble mouse i am used to but time will tell
i found in the past that logitech drivers and software were bloated and filled your computer with nuisance popups and bogged down the system with background tasks that are difficult to get rid of andor impossible to prevent
so far this mouse does not appear to have that problem
it added only  running processes in task manager after installation and they are necessaryi have to use an ergonomic mouse due to rsi
there are worse ones than this one logitech m for instance which has a difficult to use and learn trackball under your thumb but the trackball on this is about the only useful feature and the placement of that takes some getting used tostarting with the pluses the trackball is smooth and despite other reviewers complaints i dont find the leftclick button that inconvenient
in fact it is the only button that seems to be reasonably well located
like all mice of similar ilk you dont move the mouse it stays in place
this is useful on a bed or car seat for instance with the mouse just under your hand next to your legthe only other good feature is the programability of most of the buttonsmoving on to the minuses which are numerous and why i only give this model  starsfirst it is a wireless mouse yet it has a cumbersome usb antenna almost the size of a deck of cards dangling off the side of the laptop
you may as well use a corded mouse
wireless aspect is defeated by having a huge wired antenna to carry around and keep track of to say nothing of how much space it takes up in your way
that alone would be enough to drop it to  stars in my opinion but that is a minor annoyance compared with other negativesit is extremely sensitive to using batteries that are not the same strength and wont even install if one is on the low end of good
overall the driver installation is among the most difficult i have encountered for a mouse in yearsin windows  the antenna is recognized immediately but the mouse wont connect even after you push the two inconvenient connect buttons one underneath the mouse that needs to be pushed with a penpoint
get into the st century logitech
generic wireless mice costing  from hong kong connect automatically as soon as you plug in the tiny usb adapter
back to the real point
you have to go to the logitech website where there is no manual and no documentation of any use at all for this mouse and download the drivers and software which automatically installs but the mouse still wont connect until after you reboot the computer
nowhere does it say this in the near useless quick start sheet left on the website and packed with the mouse sometimes maybe
this is the only piece of hardware i have installed in windows  that does not automatically install itself and the only one that requires a restart before it works
again this is the st century
what is wrong with logitech that they cant accomplish what every other mouse keyboard external drive etc has managed to do so easily
it costs more to get less
this is an expensive mouse and for little apparent reasonnow to the buttons another feature that alone would drop this to  stars
there are  buttons most programmable
to use all the buttons without repositioning your fingers constantly requires you to use your middle finger on the trackball so the first finger is free to find the  tiny programmable buttons located on the top of the mouse which i find annoying
i am used to the logitech marble mouse
on that you can choose to use either your first finger or your middle finger for the ball
like this mouse though if you use your middle finger then the rightclick is the third finger which is not easy to learn
of course you can lift your desired finger off the ball with either mouse and then use it to also click the buttons left or right of the ball
sort of defeats most of the purpose of using a ball i thinkthe buttons are counterintuitive too tiny in most cases very inconveniently placed and difficult to discern their functions from either appearance or location
overall the mouse is designed very poorly and would only be relatively easy to learn and use if you had no prior experience with other ergonomic mice including those from logitech with the exception of the even worse aforementioned m which i cant tolerate long enough to review itthe scroll wheel is about the only button easy to tell what it is by its appearance but since it is tiny and the same color as the body of the mouse it is practically invisible along with the  buttons on each end of it
then there is another button below that set of  which is programmable but there is no practical way to remember what you have programmed any of these buttons to do
and they are difficult to find and tell from each other without looking at the mouse
who needs to look at a mouse to use it
despite how handy the  buttons could be once you get used to it there are tons of ergonomic mice and tons of trackballs that are better designed ergonomically and more user friendly
this is a very annoying mouse
i rarely give any wellbuilt product  stars but this mouse failsi bought this trackball mouse to
limit movement of wrist
limit rotation of forearm by holding trackball mouse in semihandshake position on my lap
the goal here being to limit use of the pronator teres muscle to avoid repetitive stress injurythis mouse fails with respect to 
holding the mouse in ones lap necessitates some sort of orientation calibration but this is not available in the mac os x drivers logitech providesadditionally the movement of the cursor is just not smooth enough for me sometimes too jittery especially in comparison to the ergonomic microsoft mouse i bought as a replacementalso no horizontal scrolling
lack of horizontal scrolling severely limits usefulness in photo editing video editing pdf file reading etc
in fact imho  degree scrolling should become a standard  this mouse is far from itfinally the feel  placement of the buttons is just not right
in fact i enjoyed using the good old corded button marble mouse trackball by logitech
it felt great and it was even smoother lack of scrolling though makes it a nonoption for mei was fairly disappointed
i would still like to find a good trackball mouse to limit my wrist movement but for now it will be the rather excellent ergonomic entire mouse is rotated a bit clockwise microsoft cordless laser mouse in conjunction with an extruding arm rest from my deskhowever i do think that if logitech wrote better drivers for this mouse it could be an excellent product
the jittery not smooth movement of the mouse though still puzzles me
the corded version is very smooth and my microsoft wireless mouse is also very smooth so id be surprised if it were just my setup i guess try before you buy this trackball is excellent and similar to my old one ms trackball explorer which has a layout i loveuntil you try playing games i mostly do mmos sitting for a min or two in evelotro ddo few other games will lock it up hitting the button on the bottom with a paperclip will fix it until you leave the cursor alone again
no problems doing anything else works fine for general use for days on endhad to go back and rebuild my old ms trackball explorer to use
set this one aside for when i am repairing machines at home nice that i do not need a lot of space for a mouse but disappointing overalli have  of these and the both have problems with the wireless reception
one is in my bedroom the receiver is aps  from mouse
sometimes it works and sometimes it dosent
iv tried hanging it placing on my bed  witch defeats the porpoise of wilrless on the dresser
no where does the seem to get proper reception
the other on is on my wifes laptop
i attached the receiver to the lid and still the mouse has to be in just the rite place to work
also the pointer is to slow if i play a game that i need to move quickly the pointer does not respond as fast as im trying to move
like playing pool it wont hit the ball as hard as im trying too
when it does work i love it but im tiered of replacing batteries and moving the receiver
went back to my wired mouse iv had for everthis solution did not work for me
i have a dell inspiron  which has  slots
one of the slots is being used for my wireless card
with both cards in my wireless card quits working
i cant really review the product since it is not a suitable solution for my usei tried placing this unit behind my microsoft mn wireless router which sits behind my cable modem
i have a single cat run to the far side of my house and i wanted to add this unit to that drop so i could have two devices connected in that end of the house
well unfortunately the unit seems to drop the connections every  minutes for abou  seconds
it will do this for hours and i have not been able to resolve the problem with new patch cables or rebooting pcs power cycling the unit etcvery frustratingworks sometimes for only an hour then have to reset by unpluging for  secondsyou get what you pay for did not pay much did not get muchthis router was a real hassle to install
if you know all about networking and isps and all the numbers associated with all your equipment then you can save  bucks and buy this box
i am no techie and found it impossible to install and when i was done hassling with the techsupport it turned out that the netgear router was not compatible with xbox live and the xbox  which is what i bought it for in the first place
instead i now have a linksys befsr etherfast cabledsl router with port  switch
it was a breeze to install virtually plugandplay and it works with the xbox
the linksys unit was well worth the extra  bucksi wanted to like this router but the high latency killed it for me
perhaps if i had not used a linksys wrtg and an apple timecapsule  on the same internet connection the problem would not have been so annoying but i did and it was
i really wanted a cheap simple vpn this worked with windows but i couldnt get it to work on a mac
either way it slowed down my internet response to time the point it didnt matter
if you have ever surfed on a satellite connection it created a similar delay
replacing it with the previous apple and then my retired linksys the problem went away immediatelypurchased this device with another netgear devicesame type just with wireless to perform a site to site vpn as well as manage my network
i had some stability issues with this device as well as the vpn would almost always drop
most of the time i had recycle the device to get it back
i eventually had to replace these devices as they where not meeting my needs
i had contacted netgear support there response was to reapply the same firmware and test again
eventually gave up and purchased zywalls to replace these and am extremely pleased with themi have used the fvs for about  years now
i was hit by lightening and blew out one router on my vpn
i bought a new one to replace it and found that the new v is not backward compatible with the older versions
i had to totally reconfigure the unit and purchase another one to replace the older unit that did work
netgear also has posted on their website that they will in no way pay or discount the purchase of a new router due to the lack of backward compatibility
i would suggest going away from this router and possibly going away from netgear
i have been a huge netgear fan in the past but i recently replaced my personal wireless router with a linksysim sure when this device was released it was a great product however homeoffice broadband has accelerated significantly and this device no longer meets modern standards
if you were still using old t circuits to connect perhaps this thing is fine as it wont be the bottleneckhowever with any modern dsl or cable modem this device is going to cause you paini have a cable modem and have been using apple routers for quite sometime with great performance mbps to the internet however i wanted something that would also give me the ability to vpn into my home network when i am on the road for business
i purchased this netgear device locally and rushed home to try it out
i connected it to my cable modem and my laptop to it
after running through the setup wizard i was connected to the internet that was simplei then proceeded to perform speed tests from various testing sites the results were consistently limited to mbpsthat is  megabits per second not bytes
i unplug the connect my laptop directly to the cable modem and run the same test now i get mbpsi swap back and forth and inspect the configuration of the netgear hoping to find some setting to help improve performance but i find nothingso this device ships with mbps ethernet ports however for insidetooutside performance it seems to max out at mpbs might as well have meg ethernet ports and stop deceiving us
i am returning this asapif you just need a slow vpn capable firewall this may work greatbut by todays standards it is not worth the price
when any off the shelf home wireless router with builtin firewall can match my cable modem in performance this dedicated device cant even come close
yes i realize it has a better firewallbut im not willing to suffer through  year old speed standardsbought  for the companythe st one works great w hp dj the nd one didntit sees the printer canon d but nothing was printednetgear said that it wasnt compatible w the printerthe rd one printed only once on hp color laserjet now the supplied admin program does not see both nd  rdoverall intallation should be simplerthe factory default static ip  is wrong choiceno reset buttonunplugging the cord will rest the unit to the factory defaultit means that you have to set it again on every power interruptiona neverheardconcept in it industry
i expect more professional solution from netgearthis unit is cute easy to install and easy to use
for a few minutes
weve gone through  units at a customer site at the office and at home
all were connected to a ups for power
all three units worked great at first then quit after a few hours
as long as the link light keeps blinking it is working
when the amber alert light comes on that means it detected a hardware problem and you have to repower it to reset
when the link light stops blinking and stays on solid it means the unit hung without detecting a hardware fault
when both lights go out it means the same thingthe upshot is that when you want to print you first have to get up check that the link light is blinking which it probably isnt and reset the unit
then you can go back and print
needless to say we dont use these any more
for customers we use hp jetdirect which is expensive but works reliably
for home i am still searching for an inexpensive parallel print server that works for more than a few minutes
there are a number of brands on amazon but trying them takes time and moneycaveat we bought all  units at once and the serial numbers are close together
it is possible we got a bad batch
however googling finds many other people having similar problems
the usual suggestion is light use
apparently the hardware in the unit is on the edge and sending too much data through it overheats it or tickles a timing bug  who knowsi got a ps after having very good luck with a similar dlink dpp pocket print server
we use macs which the setup software does not supportno problem with the dpp just used the web admin feature
the dlink had a default ip address and was easy to connect to with a web browser
onetime setup with a fixed ip address
my only complaint is that the dlink has no way to tell you what the new ip address is if you forget it
some print servers have a button which will print a settings page when the print server is connected to a printer
there is also no reset button to return to factory defaults
write the new ip address on the dpp itself so you have it handythe netgear ps is another story
as with the dpp there is no button to print out settings and no reset button
even though the manual refers to a diagnostic button print settingsreset button which some other netgear print servers have there is not one
the default ip address does not come with the manualthe manual does not mention a default ip address
instead it says the ps can come up with an ip address in a certain rangewhen netgear ps print server is without an ip address  and there is no dhcp server to automatically get an ip address it will selfassign a unique ip address
the address range is from  to however support says there is a default ip address of  but you can only use the default ip address if you are not connected to a router network which assigns an ip address
my web browser could not access the ps at the default ip address when connected directly to it computer to ps via ethernet cable although that might work for somethe networks i have used normally assign computers an ip address by dhcp
this is great for computers but does not work well for a print server
the ps comes setup to get an ip address by dhcp
so if you connect the ps to a network to use web admin you cannot connect until you figure out what ip address it got assigned
very unfriendly
changing settings via web admin would not worknetgear has some odd terminology
reset in the web admin means upload new setting that you have set and saved in the web admin screens
when i clicked on reset i lost my web connection to the ps so maybe it did reset
i have not been able to tell if this works because  if you unplug the ps it reverts to the factory default settings
so it loses the fixed ip address you just assigned
for my purposes this effectively means i cannot use it with a fixed ip address
as noted by h oh in another reviewunplugging the cord will rest the unit to the factory defaultit means that you have to set it again on every power interruptiona neverheardconcept in it industry
this is ridiculousthe workaround seems to be to set your networks router to always assign the same ip address to the ps via dhcp
this involves specifying the pss mac address in the router setup so the router knows when the ps turns up on the networknetgear support spent a lot of time with me but was not able to explain the above problems or help me get the setup done
the ps may work ok if you have a windows computer and can run the netgear setup wizard but even then the reset on losing power makes this a poor choicegood luck winstonthis thing failed a month after it went out of warranty
i bought two other dlink and theyre still working perfectthe firewallrouter portion of the frp is great and easy to set up but the print server is useless
i have a canon i on windows xp and it drags the print speed down so low that you want to cry
while printing graphics it literally pauses for a second or two after each pass of the print head
after installing via the recommended method netgears virtual firewall printer port i found a tidbit of two cryptic sentences on their website that suggested installing the printer via the windows ldplpr port as a remedy for slow printing
this made no difference
tech support then suggested turning off print buffering on the windows printer settings
this only made matters worse as it still printed slowy but now also ties up the computer until its donei returned the frp and will now try the dlink diup which has a usb print server
this things great if you dont mind paying an extra  for print server functionality that youll never want to usethe netgear fmp is easy to set up and administer via its builtin web interface
the rest is problematicwe have had intermittant lockups where the router simply stopped working and we had to reboot the router to continue connecting to the webwe have had nothing but grief from the builtin print server which likewise has sporadic failures requiring reboot
we are looking at buying a separate print server to solve this problem
the wireless works ok although the throughput seems quite variableoverall im unimpressed and will not likely buy any more netgear products
giving it a  may be a bit unfair a  would be about righti could link up via the wired portion to my dsl and it was fine
however the wifi was damaged
tech support from india was helpful and help diagnose the problem
it had to be returned for a new one
i just ended up sending it back for a refundill probably keep looking for something a little cheaperalthough a good steal at this price i would recommend against this card if you were in dire need of speed
this card scored very poorly in the ratings of other cards
i initially thought it would be good to get in on a cheap deal since this card is cheaper than the other ones
however since i got the item ive noticed that its slower than my other cards much slower
according to dpreviewcom this card only shows a x read  kbs and a measly x write  kbs
if you have one of the newer cameras like the canon powershot s id recommend against it
also if you had a dell axim or ipaq youll notice the speed difference immediately when you try to upload programs on to the cardok for people with like to wait and people who just want storage not speed but id pay the extra money just for the faster speeds offered by kingston simpletech or vikingif you like sandisk their ultra series are much betteri was very excited to get this card adapter so i could stop using my external usb device to down load photos
i popped it in and inserted my gb card which wasnt nearly full and it told me the estimated time to finish was  minutes
i couldnt ever remember it taking that long so i cancelled the transfer after watching it for about  minutes or so just to make sure it wasnt going to speed up or equalize or something
i put the same card in my usual usb card reader and it started the transfer of all photos not just the remaining ones and it took  minutes to complete
i dont think that usb  is slower than pcmcia bus because you can get a usb  pcmcia card adaptor
i cant figure out why a simple device would cause the transfer to take so long
it wasnt really worth the effort to return the opened  item and get charged a restocking fee so i still have it but i only use my usb card reader
maybe it would work better as a coaster for drinks or somethingi bought this reader for my laptop since it didnt have usb but to tell you the truth i think this device is a little slower than usb 
i am going to buy the lexar bit card and see if that improves the download speed because this reader is so slowit took me about min to download gb of photos from my extreme iii card
that is unacceptableseveral years back i was using these daily for music movies and all purpose use for my pcim really surprised how cheaply made these are considering there are available at big retailers like office depot
in any case sound is decent with a lack of bass
unfortunately when other signals like cell phone calls interupt there is a loud buzzing noise
you get used to it but its a nuance that can get very annoyingas for the power button and volume its cheaply made because they have jammed and gotten stuck several occasionsthis is product is extremely cheap and a bearable step up from laptop or monitor speakers but only slightly better
but for just a few bucks more there are several good models like thelogitech s  speaker system with subwoofergood luck and cheersordered these cyberacoustic cas based on reviews and previous experience with cyber acoustics
i have a cyber acoustics set with subwoofer i purchased at costco a decade ago that are absolutely amazing
while i didnt expect miracles for  i was hoping for a great bang for the buck from cyber acoustics in the cas
imhothese speakers deliver muddy sound throughout the entire frequency spectrum
note to cyber accoustics i would have gladly paid  times as much for a stereo pair wo sub that deliver cleanclear sound
on a positive note i also ordered a cyber acoustics ca ipodiphone speaker dock that does a great job
the ca delivers the exceptional bang for the buck that i have come to expect from cyber acousticsthese speakers have
couple of issues one they do not get nearly as loud as the pair that came with my desktop
and two the volume toggle has begun to get harder and harder to turnfor the money this is a nice inexpensive way to hook your computer to your stereo or play your mp or other portable music player through the car stereo when youre on the roadon the other hand if youre a stickler for sound quality like me youll mostlikely be disappointed
the signal is not consistent fading in and out with various hisses and pops
in addition the device picks up interference from just about everything including the device its plugged into so you really have to fiddle and adjust positions and frequencies to minimize the static
its not so bad if youre using it around the house but extremely annoying if youre on the road where the sound quality and interfering signals may change every couple of milesi am not telling that this product doesnt works but i bought  different fm modulators and neither of both works acceptable
as my factory radio doesnt accepts aux inputs i rather bought another stereo with an aux input and it is the best well spent money in sound quality for my ipod in my car
specially if you like to listen music better think in make a greater inversion and no to throw out your money with fm modulatorsi did a simple modification that increases its transmission range signifficantly
i took the unit appart and located where the antena from the pigtail cable attaches to the board
this is the fourth wire black notice that the pigtail carries two coaxial audio wires and one antenna wire
i replaced this with about  feet   inches of g wire
the length is important for optimum transmission since this is about a fourth of the wavelength
it also required drilling a small hole in the case to get my new quotantennaquot out
i used a drill bit just thick enough to allow the wire to pass
with this antenna fully extended straight and provided it is not laid flat on a piece of metal such as along the floor of a car i could overpower  around boston from my kitchen to my living room this is about  feet almost cleanly
within the livingroom itself signal was free from interference
that is a great improvement over original range
i suppose you could also use a dipole arrangement with two wires sticking out one from the units ground and another from the antena both at the same length
that would further extend the range
another configuration is a full wavelength antenna about  feet long
but its hard to lay it straight
many other configurations can extend range but also diminish practicality as its pretty hard enough to maintain  inches of wire straight inside a car
i suggest attaching one end to your windshield or dashboard with a suction cup or velcro etc
and letting the unit dangle from the antenna and audio out or somehow attach it to prevent strain
be careful as modifying your irock in any way voids your warranty and it also renders the device illegal to operate
so remember never to use it 
also use all common sense when locating this unit in your car so it does not interfere with safe drivingthe irocks sound quality is on par for most of these fm transmitters they all sound bad
i was aware of the sound limitations when i bought the irock my big issue is the design and placement of the power button
it is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box or just about anywhere you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries
very frustrating
the irock also limits you to only four station radio choices   etc
since i live in boston a fairly large city with many many colleges those frequency are being used
so the irock is useless for me when i am downtown
as soon as i get out of the city im fine
there has to be a better unit out therei wanted to play my ipod tunes in my car
i had a cassette adapter but the quality was not satisfactory
i bought the irock w thinking it would be better as there would not be the mechanical problem of cassette head alignment with the cassette adapterit works
the sound comes through the radio on the tuned channel
the quality is not very good
the signal drops occasionally
i found improvement by moving the unit around the vehicle but since my car antenna is in the rear that is where it worked best
it is a little difficult to control the ipod when it is several feet behind you
it is also not convenient to run a cable back there to have the irock closer to the antennai dont use it
i use the cassette adapter with its own poor sound quality problemsi purchased the irock to be able to listen to my ipod at work and in my car during the commute
although i did not have as many problems with reception as some other reviewers the sound quality is not great
and lets face it if you are buying this for something like an ipod you want to hear excellent sound quality
a major concern for those in large cities is that the irock only gives the option of operating on four stations    and   in the kansas city area there are stations broadcasting on all of those options
although the irock overrides the station with the music on your device it does tend to cut in and out with the actual broadcasting station in my area this is a christian radio station so its pretty annoying to have sermons cutting in and out of my beastie boys songssomeone wanting to listen to a device has two better options either get an fm transmitter that allows you to select any open radio signal or simply use a cassette adapter such as the ones that are used for cd car adapters
the sound quality with the cassette adapter is comparable to the sound of the device itself
and with that you dont have to use up batteries the irock uses aaa batteries and the power switch should be a slideswitch rather than a button because it is rather easy to inadvertently turn on the power and drain the batteriesi find the the unit works well at home with a sophisticated receiver but in the car it is very much affected by the environment
it works ok in some areas and terrible in other areas
i dont think this is a good solution
im buying a honda element which has an aux input jack
all cars should have thatpoor transmission quality and difficult to swap around to different channels while trying to drive at the same timewhere i live radio stations use every single available frequency
that means there is no spot on the radio dial that is free for a device such as this
it might work if you live in a rural area without a lot of radio coveragei want to use my ipod in the car but i dont have a cassette player in the car
when is someone going to come out with a cdadapterthe irock offers an easy to use sleek design as well as very good battery life
its one of the smallest versatile fm transmitters ive seenconversely its transmitting strength subtly decreases a while before the battery light goes out
it also has a very small range of fm stations making it difficult to get a clear channel
its signal range was also very short requiring very close placement to any radio device
i was a little skeptical of the molded wire when i first saw it that was until the minijack end started to slide out and finally rendered the device uselessinitially i purchased the irock to connect a cd player to my car stereo
sound quality is very good so long as you arent in an area where broadcast stations use all the limited frequencies of  to  offered on the irock
other products offer a wider choice
where i live college radio uses  and  and npr is on  with a strong signal classical station on  so none of the irocks channels provides real clear sound
the connector cord which fits into the headphone jack of the player is also too long
it worked okay when i had a cd player but now i have an ipod and the cord is just annoyingly too long causing the irocks main pod to slide off the car seat and dangle to toward the floor where gravity eventually causes it to detach from my ipod
what a painbought this for my old toshiba infinia machine
works but still have system board conflict
cant install linux since doesnt recognize drive
have  tickets into them first one for win problem was entered  days ago with no responserecommend trying different vendor that supports their productridiculously largeand designed so that it will block your second outlet no matter how you place it
pretty useless if you want to use your other outleti wouldnt purchase these again if i only needed one outlet space available they are a little bulky and then you cannot use the other jack and it covers up the entire outlet leaving you with only one jack all be it one surge protected jackthis looks nice and it is compact but it only works if you have only one or two larger chargers
the larger chargers can only go in one way so they block the plugs below them
i can only get two in bottom ends and then straight plugs into the other two outlets
two are wastedit seems to work ok but the peg in the back of the wallmount isnt far enough down
it makes the bottom of the plug stick out so it isnt flush with the wall
i will have to see if my husband can remove that when he gets home
otherwise it works just finethis was poor quality because it only has one plug instead of two
the second place for a plug was a piece of plasticsockets are too close
depending on the plug or adapter you must leave the center ones emptyits not a plug and play device you must install it on your current outlet because it has a fixed central pin blocking the back sidegot this to add a couple of outlets in the bedroom
firstly it only has prongs that plug into one outlet  not two like most you find elsewhere
secondly it does not replace the outlet cover  you remove the screw but leave the outlet cover in place and attach this over it
i dont think id plug anything into it that drew much powerlove the idea of this  and use the one i have
id like to purchase many more but wont
i use it for a number of devices some of which have those nasty  large adapterlike thingies
these casue the outlet to pull away from the wall  thus disconnecting everything plugged into it
its certainly easy enough to push it al back in but im busy working and dont need the hasslemissing the screw that holds it to the wall outletold version working with black serial port cable has program editor
writing programs with tiny screen and nonqwerty keyboard is extremely slow
with old cablesoftware it was possble to write and edit programs on pc and downlaod programs to the calculato
no morei am still keeping old machine with serial port and using black cable
new cablesoftware is few steps backwardi do not like these
they do not snap closed therefore they do not work well to hold the cd in
they are ok as long as you just want to put them on a cd rack or in the car but you must hold on to it when you pick it up or the cd will fall right out
i had some clamshell cases before that were great
dont know if i just got a bad batchthese are not very well made
the hinge will break with only a few bends
also the edge does not seal well so dust can get in
ive ordered a different product and im happy with the results therein general i like the keyboard layout and the mouse
the biggest problem i have with the keyboard is its battery consumption
i go through a pair of batteries pretty much every couple of weeks stars because the wireless and optical part works fine
loses stars for wacky keyboard layout and for stealing the function keysi have owned the logitech optical mousekeyboard combo for over a year and i much prefer the logitech
performance is very similar but the major problem with the microsoft keyboard is bizarre function key layout and mappings
the function keys ff are by default mapped for commands in the microsoft office suite
you cannot change the default permanenently you must remember to remap every time you boot or come back from standby
when you use any nonoffice programs that have useful function key mappings you are liable to mess yourself up and lose a lot of work
it is way beyond exasperating  just bad designadditionally the homeendinsertdelete key layout is nothing short of bizarre
homeend is arranged vertically on every keyboard ive ever met
with this keyboard if you are any kind of touch typist you will find yourself doing shiftdelete when you mean shiftselecttoend
this keyboard is a classic example of microsoft fixing what aint broke and coming up with a white elephant
avoid itthe concept of a cordless keyboard and mouse is nice but the application is less than perfect
the product is handsome and wellconstructed and seems durable enough to withstand heavy usage
it installed quickly and effortless into windows xp pro
the unit requires batteries to be installed into both the keyboard and the mouse which is a little inconvenient but an onscreen alert warns you to change the batteries when the power is low so you dont get surprised with a dead mouse or keyboard every few weekshowever from the beginning ive had trouble with the unit
although the mouse tracks fairly accurately without a cord every once in awhile the cursor flies widely across the screen for no discernable reason
this doesnt happen enough to make the unit unusable but it does happen enough to be annoyingalmost immediately i began experiencing periods where the mouse would stop working sometimes for long periods of time days although the keyboard would still work
i eventually discovered that a  gigahertz cordless phone near the mouse was the culprit
whenever the phone was out of the cradle the mouse would freeze
i solved the problem by getting a new phone although i now have a corded phone so that i can have a cordless mouse
this is selfdefeating for my objective of getting rid of cords running across my desk but at least everything was workinghowever after a few months of use the keyboard stopped working
the cordless phone was long gone and not to blame and multiple battery changes reinstalling the software and checking the hardware failed to correct the problemafter days of wrestling with the problem i finally ditched the offending keyboard and replaced it with a usb keyboard
although im back to having a cord its a small price to pay for a keyboard that works reliably and doesnt need constant troubleshootingi still have the cordless mouse which works adequately but every once in awhile the cursor flies widely across the screen to remind me of the folly of this purchase
corded keyboards and mice work well
although cordless would be nice it doesnt seem to me that the technology is adequate yet
bottomline i want my keyboard and mouse to work without any effort on my part
corded versions to do this well but the cordless equivalents offer less reliabilityi dont recommend this product although if you wanted to buy one slightly used we could probably work something outmy parents gave me this camera five years ago when my daughter was born
not having any real experience with cameras i am just now learning to use the manual settings on it
even so i have taken some studio quality images using just the auto settings but the images dont print well any larger than about a x
my two biggest complaints are the lag time between pressing the button and the shot actually being taken and the lens cover
i really liked the way my  mm had a lens cover that opened automatically when the camera was turned on since about half the time even after  years i forget to take it off
my parents specifically bought a camera that had a viewfinder but i must say i never use ithowever i have decided i need to upgrade for more pixels
i would not recommend this camera to anyone especially for the price i see here because the newer cameras are better and cheaperapple needs to understand that their ipods designs are flawed
if you want to spend this much money get a different brand altogether
bugs the windows version of musicmatch jukebox that comes with the ipod is loaded with bugs
in fact one in particular is really irritating the program will actually quotchop offquot a character from the tag of the mp name
in short your song by quotmadonnaquot will become quotmadonnquot on the ipod
it will cut off additional characters after you synchronize again so then it may become quotmadonquot then quotmadoquot etc
many people have this problem read the postings on various online sites if you dont believe me
plus it doesnt just send the new songs to the ipod when it synchronizes but it selectively deletes songs from the ipod and recopies them
what good is having an ultrafast firewire connection when it wants to copy  or  gigabytes to your ipod when all you have is one more song that you want to add to it
the bugs in musicmatch are intolerable but musicmatch has fixed them and posted a free upgrade to their website
but apple uses some kind of proprietary version of musicmatch so if you use the update to fix the bug then it will not work with your ipod and you have to reinstall all the software that came with the ipod again
poor display  the ipods illuminated display makes the text almost impossible to see if it comes on during the day
to turn the light off you have to go through a bunch of options on the ipod to turn it off and on each time
plus if its cold outside and you use this in your car then the display is especially difficult to see when the light is on even at night
battery life  apple claims  hours
if youre lucky youll get  or   and if you dont use the unit overnight ie
leave it in your car then it loses a lot of charge
i would typically get only  hours of use out of it only because i wasnt using it for  hours
ive read postings that it is because of apples new firmware upgrade that forces the battery to constantly drain even when not in use
oh and by the way you cannot change the battery so if the battery goes dead youll have to pay apple a bunch of money to replace it
to sum it all up the apple ipod has many design flaws simple as that
design flaws in their previous versions in an attempt to get people to waste their money on more of their products and hope that they dont wise up and take them back to the store
admittedly it would be a great device if the battery life was better and if apple actually bothered to test the software before selling it to the unsuspecting consumeralthough i only used this in the store i have something note worthy to consider before buying this aside from its lack of a versatile range of adjustments
it has to do with the fact that it only supports xd mem
as if there were not already enough memory formats yet another one
it seems to be about either desperate or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever
why cant we just have one or two formats of memory
this is as bad as it would be to have  formats of cdrom drives
and sony is even more guilty than fujiolympussmartmedia was developed by toshibafujiolympus and now fujiolympus couldnt get along with toshibapanasonic for the sd card
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices
we need to standardize the market
we cant afford to buy special memory for each and every device
if you buy fujilympus i sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xd
together the people can control the market for our own goodfirst i must thank the previous reviewer that had to go through the trials and tribulations of talking to the logitech help desk he got the unacceptable answers i need without my having to use their vru and wait forever
the logitech documentation now theres an oxymoron is virtually nonexistent and covers nothing
the software for this keyboard is not well written at all it wont function if you have norton installed and running
this is silly if you have your pc set up with the proper security and monitors then logitech should take that into account within their software or should state in their  documentation that it is not compatible with norton
the itouch software aborts everytime i boot the system
i even went out to the logitech website and downloaded and installed the latest driver without norton running and it still doesnt work correctly the f keys dont work and when i press the webcam button it launches outlook
im not even going to try any of the other keys im just going to remove the logitech software and run it as a normal keyboard
it does have a good feel and thats the only reason im giving it  stars
by the way this is all happening on a pc running xp it functions perfectly on another pc thats running windows  proi like everything else about this keyboard however after about  year of normal household use the keys have become sticky
i dont mean that they stick down but instead developed just enough resistance to be annoying
they work ok if you press exactly straight down but not if theres any sideload on them
i know it sounds picky but i have not had this issue with any other keyboard ive ever usedthis camera is spectacular
for about a year or twothen the system tape rejection errors start do your research
once this happens its to the canon repair shop you must go where they are currently charging  for the parts plus  for the labor plus taxes and shipping etc
i am now throwing my gl in the trash and saving up to buy a new one
canons repair costs are outrageous  especially when this problem has been complained about for years
a canon rep even told me to never use the camera to play or offload videos why advertise it as a feature if its such a bad idea
he advised that you should buy a cheaper video camera to do those types of tasks
good advise but even if you do remember to add that cost to the purchase price of the gl disgruntledi got it in the morning and have to return it in the evening
the reception is pretty good better than the two amplified things ive had and it seems to takes less spaceand a power outletbut it broke off when i tried to detatch and change the oriantation  the conecting part protecting the wires was so weak and untight that i think the designer must be joking by doing this
if you want to know how a poor build quality can ruin a excellent idea  buy itdecent reception most of the time but it looks very flimsly out of the box didnt have a very high waf and the solder joint connecting the coax to the antenna broke within a month of getting the thing
consider spending a bit more on a more substantial antennathis antenna is compact and works well
however beware the fragile connection to the coax cable connector at the back of the unitthe instructions say that you can orient the antenna from vertical to horizontal orientation
however they dont tell you that each time you do that you are stressing the very fragile and flimsy connection to the rear connector
i think the antenna should be redesigned so that you can safely orient the antennna from horizontal to vertical without breaking the wire connectionsi set up this antenna and the reception wasnt much better than the bowtie loop that came with the tv
i moved it to a new location and noticed that the nut holding the rf connector on was loose
i tightened it and the connector turned around in the plastic
since the plastic was also loose i looked under it and found the wires wernt attached to the connector
i also noticed the connections between the elements and the strip inside is just a press fit  not likely to last long in florida where the salt air and humidity tends to corrode electrical connections
a while later i had soldered a new connector on and set the antenna back up and got slightly better reception than the bowtie loop
poorly built and just barely worth the effort
dont buy it if you dont know how to repair things or solder wiresi was not at all happy with this item
take note that i live in an apartment in north dallas and do not have a window facing south direction in which the tv station broadcast
i am about  miles from broadcast centers
i still expected decent reception based on the reviews i read here
i used many different placements of the antenna and i received no digital channels and only a couple choppy analog signals
after calling out a service technician he removed the antenna and slipped in a plain old paper clip and got digital reception
having seen him do that i have to assume that this antenna is completely worthless when a  paper clip can get better reception
i also replaced it with an old set of rabbit ears i had and even they had better receptionsecondly the antenna is not very sturdy
while pulling the antenna out of its base to change from horizontal to vertical positioning which is listed in the instructions the wiring ripped off of the base and i have no way of reconnecting it
i am very disappointed in this product and am curious to see if all the positive reviews came from people living under broadcast towersthe unit worked well on uhf for the price but broke soon after i purchased it
the coax connector broke away when i turned from horizonal to vertical allignment
has to resolder the connection back on
if you purchase this item then handle with care because it is very fragilei bought the zenith hdtv digital indoor antenna expecting it to live up to the product description but my unit did not work as advertised
i live roughly  miles outside of washington dc where most of the hd overtheair channels are broadcast
i believe due to the distance i was not able to pick up any channels
my friend has the same model and he lives closer to dc and can pick up on all the available channels
if you live close to a major city then this antenna will work for you
if you dont then it will notthis antenna picks up the reception decently and it has a nice design
however the antenna is flimsy and it broke easily
i ended up purchasing the terk technology hdtvi vhfuhf hdtv indoor antenna and the terk lowprofile indoor antenna tv
those antennas have proven to be better antennas because they are sturdier and they pick up reception quite welli bought this antenna when i bought my samsung sirt hdtv receiver
so far i havent been able to get good performance from it
in fact ive been able to get better reception using an old fm dipole antenna like you use with a stereo receiveri live about  miles from boston and  miles from providence i bought this antenna to attempt to get a signal
i tested it and it does not compare to the cheap powered antenna i picked up
it was an rca dbi antenna for less than  and it out performs virtually every other antenna i have seen
on top of that its fm  am  scanner  cb reception is unbeatableaccording to antennaweb i live about  miles from the transmitters here ourside boston
i got the silver sensor antenna to go with the dvico goldt tuner card for my pc
of the  or  stations i ought to be able to pick up i could only get   i live in a twostory house and couldnt get consistent reception anywhere the signal strength would flake in and out
the i read about a cheap uhf antenna model  at radioshack and gave it a try
i can now get all  stations without fiddling with the direction and all that
it seems like you either love or hate this antenna
for the same  buy an antenna that will not disappointthree months after purchasing this router it just stopped working
i tried reinstalling the software and firmware upgrades but nothing worked
i was really disappointed because i like linksys and the router was easy to setup but im not sure if ill purchase another linksys as a replacementgot the befsx to replace a port router without firewall
the befsx initially seemed to work fine but then i updated the firmware as it had firmware over  months old new in the box
the new firmware completely changes the look of the interface which is fine but now the box stops functioning every once in awhile
i cant have the box that is the central point in the network do that so im reverting back to the plain router and will buy a more robust firewall box
i think they are pushing this box against its limit in order to keep the cost low but its just not worth the hassleshortly after purchasing and using the product i looked at its internal logs and noticed hundreds of lines indicating port scans mostly udp but some tcp
they were colored green
i couldnt find any information about this in the linksys manual so i called customer support
not only could i barely understand them they couldnt even answer my simple questions  are these port scans getting through
what does green indicate
frankly i dont even know if they understood my question
i have the feeling that this outsourced tech support has no expertise with this product
after several calls i reached a tech that sent me a firmware patch quotdowngradequot to install
it turned out that he sent me the wrong firmware patch as it was for a completely different linksys router
had i installed it if it would even install i might have lost access to the device altogether
beware  if you run into problems with this device youre on your owni purchased the befsx to replace another i had at a client remote office creating a vpn back to the home office with a befvpin my  years of using the befsx carefully deployed with surge protection and in climatecontrolled environments i have found that they are not reliable
the befsx often loses connectivity requiring a hardware reboot unplug  replug every few months
at least once a year a device needs complete replacement when it spontaneously gets brickedadditionally firmware upgrades often  fry it as well when linksys tech support is asked about this they throw up their hands saying there is nothing that they can doif you are looking for an inexpensive vpn endpoint with good vpn options this is ok  just expect to reboot regularly and have replacements on hand for the inevitable bricking of the deviceid agree with others that the router offers fast setup etc  but this is not exactly unique among soho routers these daysmy problems are with stability
on a regular basis the router loses its programming
web interface to the router becomes garbled and it appears that the machine is scrambling its memory ip addresses in date fields etc
within a few minutes  its out for the countfirmware flashes and all dont seem to solve it  and dont bother going to the website for support  its slim at best and youd think no one ever had an issueto sum it up its great while it works but it has some quirks that keep it from functioning properly at timesi am currently trying to get connected to the internet through this router after having a cheap dlink fail on me
i have had this router for a couple of years nowright now it is failing what i consider the cardinal test of a router
dsl modem ip address  router ip address  plug computer in can i access the dsl modem
currently no
test failed  the router should be a window to the modem not a brick wall precluding any chance of reaching the modemwhen i used it as my primary router i decided to upgrade the firmware which resulted in random reboots
rolling back the firmware fixed the problemsometimes i will be browsing the routers configuration and the router will not respond for a while sometimes resulting in a time out errorother times i will not be able to access the router at allone awkward situation i was stuck in was when i desired to reinstate this as my primary router
i had the dhcp host turned off as another router was handling that but now with no dhcp host enabled and computer directly connected to the router i cannot access the router
i guess thats what the reset button on the back is forafter some radom problems i thought i had the router functioning properly when in the middle of my web browsing the internet stopped workingwhen connected with the cheap dlink router as a slave dhcp turned off on the dlink my internet would randomly stop working
i would have to ipconfigrelease ipconfigrenew to get the internet back working
i wrote a script for it and the solution became part of my life something that never should have happened
one day i decided to break free from the routers bondage a little exaggerated language but still mess around with the settings mess something up and see if that made the problem go away
it didput it simply i cannot rely on this router to work at all times
its fabulous when it works but it has some minor issues that become extremely aggravating over time especially when they just keep happening and happening and happeningso my search for a router that will just work goes oni bought this product in  and it has work ok for the must
i have noticed that the internet speed slows down when connected via the router versus connecting directly via the cable modem
the vpn functionality is not so good and do not contact linksys customer support  you will waste your time and money
i will not get this product next timenot a great item  doesnt do much and definitely not worth the pricei bought this six months ago and finally gave up on it
it would work fine with an old corded phone but would never disconnect from the modem line although it would ring to let me know someone was calling when using three different cordless phones
all i would hear was the modem screeching then then call was disconnected along with me from my internet connection
total frustration
im going to try a controller based us robotics v modem which claims to do much the same thing only with calleridthe catchacall catchs my call but it does not let me see whos calling and according to this device it is caller id compatible
also my callers tell me my phone rings  times before i actually hear it ringing
also box says it can put your computer on hold for  seconds
im lucky if it does  seconds
and when i do get off the phone before it disconnects the computer will still disconnect  seconds after i hang upi never had a dvr aside from my computer before so when i finally managed to get my tivo all hooked up i was really impressed
i especially love the season pass feature which will pick out all the times your favorites program airs and let you schedule recording for all of them in a few clicksbut then the headaches began
first of all how many of us have the telephone line near our tvs
normally the tv and electronic gadgets are on one side of the room and the phone is on the other  right
tivo needs a phone line to get its program information  at least initially
so if your house is configured like mine be prepared to have phone line extensions strewn all across your living room while you spend up to a day downloading and installing all the program information by phoneso of course i almost began to drool when i read in the manual that you can actually connect the tivo to your local or wireless network
problem is you most likely will not be able to connect your tivo to your local or wireless network
i took tivos own approved list of hardware direct network adapters or wireless receivers to my local geek toy store and bought the top recommended networking connection on the list
that didnt work so i returned it and bought the next recommended item on tivos list
that didnt work either so over the course of the next two weeks i tried three yes  more
nothing
i finally gave up and had to buy a long extension cord for my phone line and install it more perminentlike
the main reason im here today is because i found this page while searching for an explanation to the weird high pitched whistle noise my tivo began making last night after only  months of ownership
turns out this is apparently an increasingly common problem  which i never heard of until today  and even more unfortunately seems to indicate that my tivo will be totally dead in the next few days
right now its literally delaying everything i do trying to view my cable boxs program guide etc by  seconds or more the normal lag time should be around  or  secondsso since ive already paid for the lifetime membership im now searching for a relatively cheap way i can fix the problem myself
do i need to replace the harddrive the case fans or what
by the way if tivo goes out of business how will i get my program guide
tivo doesnt grab the free tv guide data from your cable like the nosubscriptionrequired panasonics can
oh and also wanted to warn people about one more thing that only starts happening after youve had your tivo for a few weeks  which is actually intentional on the part of tivo  but which isnt mentioned anywhere in any of their manuals or documentation for obvious reasonsafter a few weeks if your tivo still works youll start to get little onscreen popup alerts right in the middle of your favorite program which stay there for atleast  seconds until you click it or patiently wait for it to go away
and what are these prompts
advertising which actually is made to look like a really important subscriber announcement from tivo
maybe its important to them but id rather not see it in the middle of my tv screen
actually thats yet another example of tivos dumb implimentation youll only see this advertising if youre watching live tv instead of the recorded programming and since most people with tivos are watching the recorded programs instead of live tv tivos sponsors are paying for ads that few people will ever see great business ideas  yes
in addition to these onscreen ads which interrupt your viewing when you go to your tivo menu youll find atleast two links to advertisements
the really bad thing about these links in particular is that they are positioned in the place where your other normal tivo menu options are listed
so instead of selecting your to do list or upcoming recordings you might accidently find yourself watching a series of advertisements  which you cannot delete or removeok so thats all i have to say at this point
seems to me that tivo had a great idea but terrible implimentation
i dont know about their customer service but i probably also wont even bother if its going to cost me  to  to ship them back their own defective product anywayif i cant fix the tivo and im not in the mood to pay doubleortriple in trying to get it fixed then its apparently just become one nice looking but useless paperweight to which i have a lifetime subscriptionfor its compact and convenience this usb hub worths  stars but in order to use usbpowered devices such as some mice keyboards or other peripheral devices you might need to buy a seperate power adapterone more thing that makes it loses  more star is it is very hard to plug or unplug the devices
for example i have a wireless optical mouse which has a small usb receiver
all  other extension ports are plugged in thus it is very hard sometimes tricky in a little dark room to plug in the usb receiver for the mouse
since the ports are so tightly packeda tablet type usb hub does not incur this problem
you can buy a  ports tablet usb hub for a little more and it works pretty well
i love usb devices and if you do you should consider the other  ports before deciding to buy this one
believe it or not once you have an usb hub the ports just run out faster than before
i have  palm  wireless mouse  card reader  digital camera   minidisc player the two works with ab cable
so now you see why it runs out pretty fastif you have some other devices such as usb drive my suggestion would be to grab a portthis keyboard has the tiniest letters  numbers on the keys that ive ever seen and this old guy has gone through dozens of keyboards dating back to the old clickity clack typewritersnot everybody is a professional typist  we need to see the letters to type
older  vision impared people will have a problem with this keyboard like putting on reading glasses to see the keyboard  then removing them or putting on another set of glasses to see the screennormally i like logtech products but what the heck where they thinking of by shrinking the letters  numbers so much
theres plenty of room on the keys
use iti had to switch back to my  dollar keyboard so i dont need any glasses at all to type or use the puteri bought the quickcam pro  so i could set up a web page camera that would upload hires  megapixel stills to my web server
upon installation of the software i discovered that the only way to use this camera for web video and still publishing is to sign up for a service called spotlife even though early versions of logitech software had automatic ftp upload capabilitiesthe spotlife service makes you fill out a bunch of personal information and agree to share that information with logitechs partners
the service only allows you to record lowres stills and video instead of the higher resolutions that the camera is perfectly capable of shooting
its plainly obvious that instead of providing software to benefit the user logitech has decided to force the user to use its servicealthough the software is pretty mickey mouse for a pro product shooting video and stills to your hard drive works well but most people buy these cameras for use as webcams
if you need a webcam do not buy this producti am happy with the picture quality of this web cam
however the mechanical leaves a lot to be desiredwith one day of using it the camera head started flopping around
looks like the spring this is supposed to be holding the head on to the base is very weak and after pointing the camera a few times it became very loose and there is no way to tighten it or adjust iti thought i just had a bad one so i exchanged it
when i got the new one home i was as careful as i can be
but within one week the same thing happened
it is obviously a mechanical design flaw
the worse part is that the usb cable attached to the camera head is long and thick relatively to the camera
with the camera head being loose the cable now controls which direction the carmea points tothis makes the camera almost unusableamazon says that this item has a video monitoring system
this is not true
i sepnt more money on this camera because the description led me to beleive that this camera had the software for video monitering
you have ot buy extra software to do thiswhat a monster to use the eye ball keeps falling off because the rotating support is so week
the power cable is so heavy that the eyeball keeps dropping when you move the eyeballquality is reasonable but such poor designi have to give this thing a somewhat poor rating because the documentation and web support are weak
i could not get this device to work with my windows xp pro system i am very computer literate and yahoo messenger  im not sure if its a windowsyahoologitech problem but after cleaning my computers registry searching for tech notes installingreinstallinguninstalling i could not get this thing to work i threw away many hours of my life trying
i gave up on my desktop computer win xp machine and installed on my windows  pro laptopbingo
it worked
for the price its not horrible but i dont love it
the software bundle is a bit cheesy
as far as being flimsy as others have writtenim not sure how rugged it needs to be sitting on your monitor
i have enjoyed making stupid faces at my brother inlaw who lives in san diegoour kids love it toothe mouse works adequately but only barely
it is not accurate when i click one line of text it often rolls to another and selects that insteadthe software that came with is useless for macintosh and this mouse will not wake a sleeping macit is comfortable in my small hand
unlike most mac mice it has right and left buttons that work as expectedthe scroll button is extremely grating rough and difficult to roll
and then only rolls verticallyfor  its only about  overpriced
i needed a mouse in a hurry after i poured milk all over my last one a kinsington they dont make anymore and when i took that one apart to dry it out small parts jumped out and escaped into the trash on my floor and this one arrived two days later
hooray amazon
boo macallyapples mickey mouse  er mighty mouse  is better but way overpriced
this will do till i find something bettermy friends and i purchased this wireless router for use in our dorm and we were sorely disappointed with the range
our dorm is x and we were not able to find a place anywhere in the dorm that allowed this router to reach the whole floor
we would get about  signal strength about ft from the router
from there it would drop to  only ft away
the software that came with it was very good and did not require you to install anything like the linksys routers do but limited range trumped out all of the positive features that it had
i have ownedpurchased for others multiple standard smc routers that were excellent but if you are going to be going wireless stay away from smci have now tried two smc wireless barricades this unit and its newer version and both have crapped out after a few monthsunfortunately i also had problems with their older wired router
although i have ensured that there is adequate air circulation and the ambient temperature never exceeds  degrees it appears that these units are prone to overheating
i found that my internet access was getting slower and slower and my ftps were aborting more and more frequentlyalso be aware that if you upgrade the firmware you will lose all your settings you cannot read the old bin file back in
be sure to write down all your current settings before doing an upgradeits too bad since i have been a proponent of smc ever since they marketed one of the first high speed uarts many years agowell at least the platter rotates and plays recordsthats about it
unless you are going to buy this for someone living in a dorm or for someone who does not have a huge record collection then this budget conscious table is suitable
otherwise skip it or youll be sorry you didnt hold out for that pricieraudiophile turntable technics music hallthorens denon etc
you will regret not getting that direct drive turntable with a high quality tonearm smooth running and accurate speed motor antiskate adjuster dial and counter weight balance for stylus pressureyou also have to have that nice pitch control for those records whose mastering speed might be a tad offbut for those on a tight budget and who dont really give a rip then knock yourself outjust dont place this table near the speakers as vibrations will affect playback in an audible annoying manner you see there was a reason why dads old technics or denon or pioneer weighed like a tank
since there is no weight adjustment for tonearm this player may not be able to track those less than perfect records that are slightly warped
alsoyou need to have an antiskating dial mechanism for the tonearmcartridge
as a tonearm gets close to the center of a record during playback any cartrdige needle will tend to pull more towards the center of the recordpressing more against the left or inner stereo channel than stay perfectly in the center of the groovethats the reason you want antiskating mechanism
without it the sound of the record as the tonearm moves inward to the last few tracks will have a sort of staticlike distortion when it comes to high frequencies or fast musical passages both loud and complexbasically if you are looking for a second household turntable to use since you already have the higher quality one or for the young ones to use then the audio technica atpl is the way to go
also remember that this is a belt driven turntable so depending on how heavily it will be used better inquire about getting that extra belt just in case as all belts on such a turntable will stretch within time develop smooth slipping spots or become dryi saw the reviews on here about erratic skipping with this turntable
i bought a refurb with the hope that any bugs wouldve been worked out
unfortunately i wasnt to be so lucky
i think tiny pieces of dust missed by my preplay cleaning must be large enough to knock the needle out of the groove because right as im beginning to enjoy a passage it grunpk skips ahead or behind a few secondswhen using the autoplay feature the needle drops anywhere from  seconds to a minute into the first track
thats no major problem because i just use the cue control to set it correctly but the arm drops way too quickly for my comfort
the chassis is very cheap feeling overall something i knew going in but its nonetheless important to knowso what does this table do well when its working properly
well it actually sounds a whole lot better than it has any right to for its price
additionally it tracks everything ive given it even some warped garage sale stuff
if my table is indeed an anomaly then this could be a great valuestill i cant help but feel ripped off
it played  sides correctly but now every other record i play will skip like mad
so either i got a lemon or all the star reviews are from people who dont use a turntable every dayin the end its about the same price to put together a vintage turntable rig that will far exceed this deck in both performance and reliability
i found a philips af on craigslist matched it with a new ate cartridge and an inexpensive phono preamp the at pl does have a perfectly acceptable preamp built in part of why i bought one all for approximately the same price as this table
at the risk of sounding like a bitter old man they dont make them like they used to
this combination sings beautifully
i tried to save money for my home theater setup i have a beautiful dual q in the stereo system and find myself listening to and buying more records these days than ever before
seriously consider spending  minutes to learn how to setup an old turntable youll thank meim very disappointed in bose
i bought these for a bose v that i was mounting on the wall
these worked but it wasnt as easy of an installation as it should have been
step one in the instructions is to drill a hole in the back of the speakers
there are pictures that show drill in a bit but not too far without much additional information
not classy
it feels like a crime to drill holes into a brand new speakerthey come with screws for mounting directly into studs through drywall and into masonry
they link up pretty well and feel secure
be advised that if you are installing into drywall the anchors that they provide require a  holethey are pretty well sizedi purchased this thing so i could watch the mlb allstar game from within the stadium
let me tell you the reception is so mediocre  im not even going to bother lugging this mini monster to the game with mei tested out reception from  different places
inside my home along the open waterfront area of new york bay and within the city amongst the skyscrapers
all were equally poor in qualityin the days when you convert video to an ipod format yes i know its not live tv that is crystal clear and awesomely bright this thing seems as quaint as a spinning wheel
granted it might be ok in a hurricane or emergency situation but if the signal really will drop all together in a year or two when they switch over to full hidef this is no more than a paper weight waiting to happen
save your money and wait until something like satellite for portable tvs comes outin general the picture works but requires the long telescoping antenna and the signal varies while your watching iti bought this filter and it was fine for three months but then while out shooting it came apart in my hand meaning the half of the filter that you rotate separated from the half that screws to your lens
the cclip that holds the two halves together went flying but i managed to find it
unfortunately it ended my shooting day because the cclip is coated with a thin oil that splattered all over my lens and was impossible to remove without a strong cleanerwhen i got home i managed to snap the two halves back together and managed to clean my lens but the actual filter is almost impossible to clean because when you wipe it your cloth will touch the edge of the filter and pick up more oil so you end up fouling the glass againive contacted the seller to see about a replacement
the filter works well but could use a bit better qcdid i have a polarizer filter on
i know i didp because i put it myself but my pictures didnt display the change
also for the first time user the purchase didnt come with any instructions
i learbpned from a friend about the little arrow and turning of the filterthese would best be described as slight noise reduction not canceling
i tried it at home where my pc fan is quite loud and i could barely tell the different
at work it barely effected the drone of the leave blowers that run for  minutes
it effects voices not at all
the headphone have little base with reduction on
these headphones provide practically no isolation from your environment
im returning them and looking for something that is effective
i rated  stars becasue they are not complete junki was unfamiliar with sangeans products until i started searching amazon for a compact radio last spring
none of the handful of models made the cut simply because i didnt desire the expense or additional shortwave bands of the sangean models under consideration
instead i chose the very cheap but surprisingly good ge  amfm portable amazon sells it a very rugged very basic radio
ive used it constantly for months without any complaints save one which is that it is not a pocket model and therefore is less convenient for someone who is moving around a lot
this little sangean is the answer combining a very good digital tuner with up to  total presets in three bands am fm and tv channels   presets are handy but sangean made a big mistake when they decided to do them with only a single button that forces you to flip through all the presets in order to reach the previous one in the sequencea better way would be to use a rocker switch that goes backward or forward hope the manufacturer will read this and take note
reception is outstanding for a pocket radio
sound from the included earbuds is decent especially for talk shows though they are obviously something of an afterthought from the manufacturers standpoint
i tossed them in favor of my bettersounding old panasonics which dont hurt to use and reveal the fine sound this radio produces
there is a  speaker that serves wellenough for am talk radio and just barely for fm music programs if its held near the earthink of it as a backup to the headphones
thats it for the electronicsand thats where the trouble begins as i see it that being the case construction which is pretty shoddy and illfitting
there are gaps that should not exist on a  pocket radio which is why it is imperative that the unit is kept out of the elements one errant raindrop could ruin ittotally inexcusable
a gasket should be between the two halves of the plastic case both as weatherization and as a shock absorber
those buttons should be rubberized or at least somewhat less permeable to dust and liquids
i can see one of the batteries behind the poorlyfitting compartment lid
i can also see the day when the lid breaks and i will need to secure it with rubber bands
and the detachable belt clip doesnt look that durable eithernevertheless it is the electronic component namely the excellent digital tuner that make this a worthwhile acquisition
this radio has been manufactured basically unchanged according to one source since  which means sangean considers it a proven design
for an update i hope they tighten up the case in order to make it a classic
for now it is merely very good
edit  failed after a year and a half out of warranty naturallythe problem with small radios is their size restrictions
only when you accept the fact that a good small radio will not perform like a good bigger radio
if you really want a small pocket radio for portability and pocketability  then you can make an objective review of this radio
most small radios sell for  to 
here i am reviewing a  small radio  therefore it must be considered both for its premiun price and as pocket radiowith that said there are two major problems with this radio as compared to the very best digital small radios
the speaker often produces mediocre to poor am sound
this speakers sound at normal listening levels is somewhat distorted by interference on am stations that have all but the strongest signal
also the ability to pick up am stations is just fair within my home
of course the tiny antenna effects a small radio  but this is a premium small radio and we should expect the best performance for its sizeas this radio is digital i made comparison with three small digital radios
my conclusion is that the radio shack digital pocket radio that lists for  is the better radio
no small radio is perfect but wihin its category i believe the radio shack is the best value
its sound and reception is as good as i have experienced for this type of radioi bought this to take fishing in the snake river canyon in idaho
i have a cheap radio that doesnt get too good of reception down there so i got this one to improve the receiption and sound quality
well its not as good as the old cheap one the only reason i give it two stars is that it is cutei bought this based on glowing reviews on amazon and other sites dedicated to the am dxing hobby
im well aware this is a pocket radio and all have their limitations and being that ive been an amateur radio operator the past  years ive owned literally hundreds of radios both good and bad
i feel the biggest shortcoming of the dtxs mediocre am performance is the agc automatic gain control circuit it is molasses slow
its a shame because otherwise sensitivity and selectivity is above average for a radio in this class
i counted up to  seconds before the agc recovered to normal volume during quick station fading this can also be heard by stepping updown the band station to station
why is this big deal
for the average listener they may not even notice if the only stations they listen to are big kilowatt local broadcasters during the day
on the other hand for someone trying to pull a signal out just above the noise floor the slow agc makes it a tedious process if not impossible
additionally stations coming in strongly at night that take a sudden deep fade the agc is so pronounced and slow i thought the batteries had died until the signal faded back in
even worse the agc in this radio also induces some audio clipping and distortion on marginal signals or those that arrive via multipaththis is not to say the dtx is a bad radio
most of those who would consider purchasing it for mostly fm listening and casual am listening will be fairly pleased
im impressed with how uniform sensitivity is on am
selectivity is good without being too narrow to spoil audio quality and nulling of adjacent interference is fairly sharp when turning the radio
audio is ok when using decent ear buds and leans towards the vocal range on am which is a plus
however even though the internal speaker is primarily a utility feature it is one of the worst ive ever heard  even more so than my tecsun pl which has about the same speaker sizewithin the first hour of using the dtx i seriously considered returning it which wouldve been a first out of many amazon purchases
i have since had a change of heart and will live with its quirks on am and add it to the collection
it certainly wont be used nearly as much as my sangean prd sony srf and srfmw
its really too bad sangean is so close to an excellent ultralight performer with the dtx but it misses the mark with the wonky agc and clipping in my opinion
its possible the dtw and newer ccrane amfm pocket portable are better choices for what im looking for
maybe i got a dudi do know im not willing to spend another  on a pocket radio to find outas the title says im trying to like the dtx
i had the dt for a couple years and it worked great until i dropped it into a mud puddle
electronics do not like mud puddles
after deciding i did not need the weather radio function i decided to try the dtfirst try out of the package put batteries in the radio and a static noise came from the speaker whether the radio was on or off
returned it
tried the dt for a while and i decided i did not like it for various reasonsordered the dtx a second time
out of the package put batteries in turned on the radio and tuned it to a station no sound
i made sure the speaker switch was in the correct position
returning this one and requesting a direct replacement of the dtxi like the functions and buttonvolume control positions of the dt and will give the dtx a last try
im hoping it will not disappointmy sangean dtv pocket radio failed after  years of infrequent use
i kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes
it worked perfectly on the few occasions when i used it over the  year period until yesterday
the buttons switches and display still work perfectly but only very faint white noise can be heard whether via speaker or via earphone
the volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control
the batteries are new and there is no corrosion from the previous batteriesi bought this for a product video i was doing for myself and wanted to do some slow pans with minimal jerkiness
for the price i didnt expect a topnotch professional panning head but i did expect there would be some fluid dampening when panning
however it is strictly a frictional head
no matter what i tried with this tripod i could not find that sweet spot between not enough friction and too much
too much and the head binds and too little and it flops around aimlessly
this tripod is excellently priced for something that doesnt work well
on the good side the return policy for tie photo  electronics inc was good and i was able to return the tripod and buy the ephoto professional video camera fluid drag tripod head by ephoto inc ah from amazon instead
i paid only  for the head and attached it to an old tripod quality i had although i did have to buy this adapter to make that work manfrotto lbp adapter inch  to inch with flange
if youre looking for a cheap tripod for home use and dont care about panning then this might be a good choice
it does come with a builtin level but dont be mislead by the way fluideffect head
theres nothing fluid about itthis adapter was noisy on am stations when used with the sony radiofound a generic at radio shack  however that worked just fine  and was quiet for about the same pricesummary adaptor could create interference if used with am radios acceptable for cd mp or other nonradio applications
the star rating applies to use with radios only not recommendedevaluationthe ac adaptor is typically presented as a better together purchase recommendation for sonys icfmv portable fmamtvweather radio
however information on the adaptors package specifically states that the adaptor is not recommended for use with radios due to potential interference
the unstated reason for this is that the power supply in the adaptor is a switching supply which creates interference particularly for am signalsthe adaptor should work with cd or mp players without any problems as this is the intended applicationnote i am basing this recommendation on the information sony provides on the package
i have not tried it i returned the adaptor unopened to amazon for refundwe live in a major hurricane area so one of the main reasons i bought this radio was for the weather function
because of our location we have two us weather bureau stations we can receive the weather warnings on
when i first got the radio i didnt think it could pick up the weather band at all
a while later when i happened to be standing in a specific location in the house and held it at jusssst the right height and angle i could here faint mostly unintelligible sounds come from it when on that bandits useless as a weather radio unless you are on top of the broadcast stationit works ok for amfm but nothing to write to friends aboutwrote the below review a couple of years ago before the change over to digital
this little radio was great when i was able to hear the audio from tv shows but cant anymore
still get am and fm but purchased this specifically for tv
soneeded to change my reviewhi to anyone interested
i purchased one of these for myself and then another for my husband to use at work
i have a little radio shack amfmtv radio
ive really enjoyed it have had it for years and in fact is still working well
however when i wanted to switch back and forth between two stations i had to dial to one or the other which wasnt horrible but
i dont have to dial back and forth with this sony since its so easy to program five stationsactually  when you consider the different bandsand have them ready to go with a touch of the button
also we lose electricity often enough so its nice to have the tv portion when the electricity goes out
i do recommend this highly and without reservation
oh
the sound is great toothis is a typical lowend fan
it will be noticeable if there are no other fans near it though it wont stand out above the fans of a typical computer
my unit began making a scraping noise within less than  week of installationi bought this to eliminate a buzzing sound from my guitar amplifier that i believed was caused by the electrical supply in my home
sadly it had no effect on the buzzing sound
i play an lp through a marshall tube amp and i can hear a buzzing sound when tvs and other electronics are turned on in my house
there was no noticeable reduction in the buzzing sound
i think the problem is emi which is through the air not the power circuit so no amount of power supply isolation will helpim torn on what kind of rating to give this since my problem is apparently not what this is designed to fix
i dont want to trash it because it might work for others just not for my problem
im giving it  stars so people with a buzzing sound from their guitar amps when other electronics are active in their home will see that it doesnt clean up your power supply for things like that
the buzzing in my case is emi and no amount of power isolation will fix iti dont expect superior quality in these lowpriced tool kits but i was definitely disappointed in this productthe screwdriver is essentially useless
it is a clever design with a swivel head but poorly designed
it is a challenge to keep the head straight and sturdy when used as an ordinary screwdriver
i cant imagine one would fare any better with the head set at a  degree anglei broke down and bought a klein multitip screwdriver as a replacementthat improved the utility of the kit immenselythe flashlight is useless
in this day and age a cheapy incandesent flashlight is little more than a toy
a compact led flashlight would have been a better choiceoverall if you replace the screwdriver the kit is serviceable
otherwise look elsewherei bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography
i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion
if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take themused it some on my original canon but it does not fit my newer onei purchased this mouse because my wrist sometimes bothers me
its a great concept
unfortunately poor build quality and unprogrammable buttons earned this device a spot in my junk drawerthis is a great product for my laptop and i use one all the time
the reason i rated it a  is because the average lifespan on one is about a monthsome will last  or  and  quit in one day
i have a box of about  that either the ball quit or the clicker broke
i may package them someday and send back to fellows
however when they work they are really good to do graphics and easy to get details with the pointer
my recommendation is that if you can afford these they are great or if you have the patience to send back to fellowes they will replace free
overall  shop around for good value expect detailed use for short time save package and if we all send them backmaybe they could be made to last a little more than a monthi got this to try hook computer up to my tv with a dvihdmi cable it does not work i realize that right after i bought it and tried to cancel the item but seller refused and now wants me to pay to ship it back to get a refund
ask questions before you buyi didnt need item as some acquaintance had an item similar and gave it to me
originally considered sending it back but changed my mind after attempted getting contact with dealer via amazonthis didnt do what i expected respect the other readers and note that this doesnt convert the signal from analog to digitalcool
makes sense
doesnt work
well it worked when i bought it then it stopped working
obviously cheaply made
not recommendedi ordered two of these cables and found them to be wellconstructed and fully functional as would be expected for something so simple
however the plastic housing around the male connector is thicker than on a standard usb extension cable making it very difficult to plug this in right next to another device if you have sidebyside usb ports
in fact trying to plug both of these extensions into such sidebyside ports starting to put so much side pressure on them that i feared i would damage the ports
keep that in mind if you are thinking of using this cablei have a  port powered usb hub below my desk
i bought this as an extension for it so it could reach my computer
even though the hub is powered devices would drop connection to my computer constantly or not ever connect  like my iphone
i ended up getting a different cable and it works greati purchased this to use with my iphone gs gb
after numerous tries it kept telling me that the phone did not support charging through that device
i tried it on my ipod touch th gen gb and it worked for about  minutes then stopped
tried again and same thing kept happening
i considered returning the product until i found out that it could charge my ps controller
i guess ill keep it but it certainly did not work with my iphone and ipod touch like it was supposed todoes not hold the wire in very well and can fall out easier
makes it a night mare when your ethernet is out and you do not know whether it is the service wire or adaptorthe picture should be changed to reflect the actual product received
i received an ivory color not white the packaging was terrible and it is not similar shape or size compared to the picutre
it looked like someone grabbed the coupler from someones desk threw it in a box and shipped it
i have no idea if it is new or used
not very pleased with the price or the shipping fee which is my fault for ordering too quickly
dont waste your time with this particular product or shipperyes it does workthese particular memorex cd labels are a much lower quality then what is advertised here
the memorex product number on the bottom of the sheet is different than the one shown in the picture
i dont think the seller has any control over this
it appears that memorex decided to use lower quality materials and sell them as the same thing to save a little on the bottom line
however the difference in quality is very obvious to anyone who uses photos on thier cd coversi really like the material and shape of this concealer however the fault lies with the way it is shippedit comes rolled up the kind of rolled up where you need a machine to roll it perfectly for youi read some suggestions on how to get rid of the shape it was stuck in
i put it under my bed right where i would sleep for about  hoursit was no longer stuck in the rolled shape but the end that was in the center of the roll still had frills under it those would not come out and i had to cut that end offafter cutting it off my  foot cord concealer had become  and a half feetit doesnt hold many cords and getting it to straighten out was a pain
it really wasnt worth the hassle or effort
knowing what i know now i would have just taped the cables to the floor and called it a daythis was very difficult to use
the channel for the cord was not really large enough and i was using a belkin surge protector bought at the same time
the strip was so curled that it took a long time to get it to lay flat enough to apply the double stick tape
you might consider laying it out flat for a couple of days before you try to use ittypically i like belkin products
im disappointed in this one
i started by unrolling the cord concealer and rolling it up in the opposite direction to get the kinks out from shipping
i dropped it into a sink of hot water for an hour then laid it on the floor to flatten which it did beautifully
however it does not work well
the cord does not want to say in the channel even with double faced tape
and the concealer does not lay flat on the floor
the top side of the concealer is flat while the bottom groove that holds the cord is rounded down
the sides stick up from the floor a good  inch
it is a tripping hazard
i with i hadnt bought  of these
i do not recommend this productmine was  long but only about  feet are useful
the inner  feet are wound so tightly they are permanently distorted
about  feet of the outer end are distortedmine arrived without the tape but the problem was quickly corrected when i reported it
instructions said to drop the return package into any ups drop box but if you use the original package it is too big for a drop box
you have to find a service centera decent deal if you are going to need only  feetthe last cord concealer i had bought was from wiremold and i expected the belkin brand to be of the same quality
however the wiremold concealer is better in every way
its sturdier made from better material and sits flat without any problems
even after flattening out the belkin concealer for a month with weights they will wont sit flat
they are made from a much crappier material it doesnt look as nice and does not seem to be as strong as the wiremold brand material
im actually considering throwing this belkin one out and buying another wiremold because even after a month of being weighted down they wont sit flat on their own
i live in an apartment with carpet so the sticky tape is not an option for me i need a concealer than can stay down without adhesives
this product is useless for meso i bought this product today and started to put it in place only to figure out that the included doublesided tape is about  feet shorter than the concealer
so ill have to go out and buy some more double sided tape to cover the third of the concealer that is currently sticking into the air
i find it totally puzzling how something so incredibly simple could be overlooked  especially from a brand like belkin which usually does a great jobif it werent for this issue i couldve easily given this product  starsthis cord concealer is only mediocre  it would not flatten out and one end was gnarled up and required duct tape to hold it down
however it is well constructed and does the job for high traffic areaswho ever designs the packaging on these types of thingscomes in a tight roll so it will never lay flat and the tape that comes with it is totally useless
its soft and flexible but will not stay flat even after holding it down with weights
the opening running down the center of it where the put the cables to conceal ends up wavy and uneven from being rolled so tightly so even if you can get it taped down it will not lay flat because the edges are jaggedits really hard to screw up a product like this
but belkin found a waywhen i first saw the pictures of this sort of wrapped in a coil i though hmm that could potentially cause problems getting it to sit down well i was incredibly right
this stuff will not sit down on its own in fact it will be a bigger tripping risk than the wires you are trying to conceal
you could try using the double sided tape which wasnt even in my box but i doubt it would have the stick to keep this on the ground cleanly and plus i dont want adhesive residue on my hardwood floorsin fact belkin coils this stuff so tight to fit it in its packaging that it actually breaks down the form of the cord concealer
so instead of being an arc its flattened out the wrong way which means the flaps along the bottom dont meet correctly and the youll have a  of a time getting the wires to stay in the concealer while you try to get it to stay down on the floorafter a while of fighting with it i threw a rug over the concealer to get it to stay down and not trip me all the damn time
which really defeats the purpose of the product in the end
maybe in a few months of being laid flat the concealer will have straightened out enough to be useful on its own
but i kinda doubt itit you can id recommend getting a concealer from an actual physical store where they might not have coiled the productthese things have one job and thats to lay flat
and belkin screwed it upso the reason i bought this was to have something soft heavy and flat to cover and contain loose wiring
these would be perfect if only they were not shipped rolled up like snails
after i unrolled them and set them up on the floor they gradually curled up again
this led to people especially younger type people kicking them knocking them around and eventually even knocking down some expensive speakers to which the wires were attachedi know some people have actually resorted to boiling  these items and reforming them while hot
in the end i just dont have the time to deal with that
in this case i was suitably warned
i read the reviews and figured it couldnt be that big of a deal
but alas it isevery once in awhile you get a bad one
i put it in the computer and it crashed it
after testing it was the memory had to send back and get creditpurchased this svideo cable to replace an old frayed composide video cable in an attempt to get a better picture quality
unfortunatly the picture quality achieved using this svideo cable is noticeably worse than the old composite cable
 would not recommend this productjust putting it out there i am very computer and network savvy so i have confidence that there wasnt usererror involvedthe product came in on time all the lights flickered but the ethernet port didnt worki did not investigate further because whateveri would not recommend this card for use as your primary tv andor even for recording video
even with my intel core extreme and gb of mhz ram this card produces choppy video
it may not be annoying to some but it is to me
i would recommend getting an external usb device for a tv tunerif you search around on the web eg brighthand pocketpc thoughts youll see that quite a number of users have problems with sandisk memory cards
they used to be the cheapest but not any more
for the same price or even lower you can get muchbetterquality memory cards from lexar
i highly recommend lexar for reliability speed and lower power consumptioni own a canon d with a sandisk ultra  and a lexar  xthe lexar is just slow basicly i would say go for the fast ultra but the lexar works fine only it takes timethe clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell
i bought two boxes both boxes stank
maybe if you pay a little more you get the nonstinky kindyou get red orange yellow green and blue sleeves  of eachi bought this camera bag because it was on sale but when i got it i discovered that it is a bit on the bulky side
its a little larger than what i was expecting
if you dont mind toting a larger bag for you little camera than i would say buy it but if you bought your camera because its easier to carry than i would avoid purchasing ithad this mp player two weeks and the volume up botton stopped working i took the player apart and resoldered the micro switchand that solved the problemas im electronic technician this wasent much of a problem for me but to all others consideringthis product beware the construction of this thing is hardlyrugged
on the plus side it has great sound and the battery life is pretty good it also supports low bitrate files which is why i bought ithope my little review helps with your buying decisioni bought mine at costco on impulse and then i read the reviews here to see why this sucks
i agree with the bad reviews
the fm stinks lots of static the holder doesnt align with the buttons and the songs are played in the wrong order
i have a nomad ii but didnt want to spend the money on a smartcard to get more songs on it and an arm band and so i bought the ss when i saw it starts with  had the arm band and was half the size
i kinda liked the headphones they hold on to me nicely
the only reason i gave it  starsoh well back to the drawing board
its going back
save your money im still reading maybe i can find a better choice this timethis router has some problems
the dhcp implementation does not follow standards as a result some compactflash wifi adapter cards will not work with this router
the keyword blocking feature does not work in the firmware upgrades  and higher
after firmware upgrade the router stops generating access logs the empty logs are not emailed as per schedule and the router stops showing the attached devices
technical support is extremely poor with no solutions to the problem and long hold times
aside from these problems it is really a great producti bought this router it must be at least two years ago
i used linksys in the past with no problems
however their customer service is sooooo bad which in the end is the same thing for netgear that i decided to switch for my first wireless router to netgearthe product worked great
at the time i had windows and linux boxes connected
no problem for about a year and a half
so i recommended another netgear router to my motherinlaw when she needed one
we live in the suburbs and sometimes get power loss
im guessing that this is also associated with a power surge
anyway although my motherinlaws router was plugged into a power surge protector when she lost power the wireless part got messed up
one of the computers connecting wirelessly would continually drop packets
i did all of that power cycle nonsense to no availthen i lost power in my house as well
again its connected to a surge protector but when the router came back on every computer wired and wireless was fine except for one mac os x powerbook connecting wirelessly
so again the issue was wireless
and the problem was the same
if you ping the router it typically drops over half the packets
this had nothing to do with signal strength as it would happen even if i was right next to the router and had an excellent signal
even grabbing text web pages was next to impossibleid struggle to work like this
vpn access to my job was a joke
connecting wired worked but my desk is set up with no ports near by and its impractical for me to connect wired without doing major work
kinda why i got the wireless in the first place
then all of a sudden one day everything was fine
about another six months of no problems
i completely forgot about the issue
then one day packets were being dropped again on the same powerbook
i have two windows machines connecting wirelessly no problem and a wired windows machine no problem
i dont currently have any linux boxes connected
and my mac connects fine anywhere else
did all the typical stuff
firmware upgrades power cycles yada yada yada
even if i used a battery backup they generally make the software to shut down the operating system gracefully not things like routers and monitors
the thinking is that it should be fine as long as its protected from surges
needless to say technical support is a joke
they were so happy to find out the problem was with a powerbook
oh yeah
must be their problem
and would often hang up before you could even reply hey the wireless protocol has nothing to do with which operating system youre running
whats most annoying about all of these routers is the fact that i havent found one thats consistent and has good customer support just going by the reviews that is
no matter what the vendor some report great success while others report nothing but problems
makes it really hard to say ah ha thats the one to buy
anyway i just bought a linksys wireless g hopefully this will work outwith my ssh connections into my home system and chess club connections im timed out after some period of time around  minutes
i did not have this issue when my pc was connected directly to the highspeed cable bridge
i liked netgear products in the past but this issue is a little more than annoyingi thought this would be a quality router given the netgear name but i was wrong
setup seemed easy but functionality was a different story
at first it seemed fine
however it made my dsl connection seem slower than  sometimes it worked
but most of the time it didnt even work at all
the signal strength showed quotexcellentquot on my pcs so i thought my dsl was the problem
vigilantly i got rid of my dsl and got cable thinking that it would solve the problem
how wrong i was
i got the same old crap i did with the dslit seems as though the netgear mr was not all that it was cracked up to be
the problem persisted
i used the process of elimation along with the knowledge that it couldnt be interference because the same problem occured when wiring a computer to its port switchso i decided to fold with the mr and purchase a linksys befws which i had had good experiences with at a different location
the problem was solved giving me flawless internet on all pcs on the network
so that was my problem
the netgear mr had been the sabteur of my networkthe only reason i have the mr the extra star  more than minimally required was that i chose to give it the benefit of the doubt that my specific router was defectivei was very disappointed with this router
i had just installed an old linksys wireless router for a friend but decided to get a netgear router since it was on sale
the old linksys router had a lot more configuration options than this router
out of the box it doesnt offer the ability to switch off broadcasting the ssid
you have to upgrade the firmware to be able to do that
even then you cant turn the wireless radio off like you can with the linksys
for securityconscious folks turning off wireless when youre not using it is like locking your door when you leave homeso compared to the linksys router the netgear is definitely lacking
the range on this router also does not seem as good as i what i had with the older linksys routeri bought this mrv because it was cheap
the features and html interface turned out to be decent
it worked decently for a little while a week or two
edit i just got a defective producta replacement product works well
see the end of the review
then it started having intermittent problems of dropping the connection until a power cycle all of this is wired not wireless
i upgraded the firmware but the issues persisted
then the dhcp server portion of it died and will not come back to life
it is also not directly ip addressable
so it is dead
it even gave me the bizarre situation of simply acting like a passthrough to my cable modem dhcp server ipconfig returned the cable modem ip and the network worked exactly like the computer was plugged directly into the cable modemyeah that was a new one to me too
hardresetting actually broke it more now the power light does not operatemy recommendation is to buy anything but netgear
i had good experiences with netgear cards in the past but apparently things have gotten much cheaper since those days
i had a belkin router before this
it had fewer features but was extremely reliable
too bad i gave it awayi will see how their rma process works
i just hope they give me a different modelupdatemy new one came fairly quickly and it is perfect
it never drops or gives me any trouble
i restart it every few weeks and there are never any problems
it works with two dlink cards and my sony clie thi now can recommend to get thisbut be aware that you stand a chance of getting an defectso dont be afraid to rma
inexpensive networking equipment is made cheaply so defects happen
but working ones happen too
i had far more problems with a dlink router than i have ever had with this working netgear router ie
i had quite a few with a comparable dlink and none with my working netgearthis product would have received  stars except for port forwarding does not work
that means you cant optimally use your favorite file sharing software eg kazaa with this router
 star when your connections exceed  connections very common when file sharing the router dies loses its connection to your broadband isp and requires a power cycle in order to get it working again
 star on the feature list it says it has network printer sharing capabilities but its actually done thru setting up a dedicated pc attached to the printer so you have to turn that pc on and wait for it to boot in order to print
no dedicated print server
 starit does get  star for style and design and another  star for having good range and a removable antenna for mounting in a more optimal location however i havent been able to find a place where you can purchase the ext
cablemy other choices are microsoft linksys and smcalthough the smc is the only one that comes with a dedicated print serverthis is my nd wireless router i am not counting my access points
im a tester in a network company so ive done sone detailed observationprosnetgear did an awesome job by making this slick looking router with nice lights
theres even a sticker which explains what each lights are for
setup is straight forward
for most people they will only need to stick with first  pages and subpages of those to get everything donethe uglyfirstyoull start to get into some hairy stuff with the wifi page
when you set the country and channel you will notice that after refresh it disappears
sometimes it sticks but most of the time you have to do this several times
not only that the help tab does not show up until youve made a change
obviously a bugsecondthe port forwarding on the older firmware is flaky
you will need to upgrade your firmware to the latest released which was in maythe really ugly stuffmy smc router was working fine in an urban environment
if i sniff the air i see  other routers
so i plug this thing in put it on the same channel as smc and it just flaked out
this router can not be trusted to be up x yet
occasionally it will just die and require a hard boot
after the firmware upgrade router seems to have stabilized but prior to this it would die every other day from whoknowswhatin short this router is pretty nice looking and seems to have stabilized with  firmware revision
the new firmware has only been out for couple of weeks and ive only had to reboot once
after you upgrade the firmware i recommend that you hard reset it via the button on the unitfor now i can not recommend this productive tested it with iso downloads with the new firmware redhat   isos each with megs and the thing stayed up
prior to that this thing would hang
if you are going to power this thing on and off every day then its a good deal  but if you want something you want to configure once and deal with it maybe x a year this unit has not proven itself to me
the new firmware seems to be great but its only been  weeks since its release installed the day after it was released and it took them  months to release it
then again i can not recommend smc either
if you have the money and are willing to pay for stability linksys seems to be the choicebtw theres a nd version of this router and its supposidly smaller and no longer has the detachable antennai use this router as wireless access pointbut when i tried to configure i got stuck on smart wizrad and i dont have to login at allafter i referred the manual found i can bypass the stupid wizard but i still can jump in without loginthis is a severe security issue
other than that it works ok as access point no disconnect with pdaswarning if you use this router as ap you must disable ssid broadcast and enable mac filtering at leasti purchased this router to set up a wireless network for my pocketpc with builtin wifi
i have not used it with another quotcomputerquot in my house strictly my pocketpc  it was pretty easy to set up
took me like  minutes so thats a plus decent range
for the price it has decent range
i can sit outside with it but not in my living room where the cordless phone can interfere with it even when its not in use slow signal
if im sitting within  feet of the router my internet goes at a fairly fast pace comparable to dialup
unfortunately im running a dsl line so the slow speed can get very irritating
my signal drops a lot at home whether from neighborhood cordless phones or just the unsteadiness from the router
ive pretty much given up talking on aim with it because of dropped connections weak signal
my neighbors wireless network router will actually overpower mine even when im sitting right next to my routerif i were you reading this review id want to spend a little more money and get a highquality router
its great to save a few dollars but not at the sake of dropped connectionsall i can say about this router its not build to last more than  or  months and then the wireless feature died all the sudden
i will not recommend this router to anyoneuse it at a vacation home doesnt pick up a good as i had wanted wouldnt purchase again if i had the choiceas a wired router it is beautiful and great
works superbi tried everything possible distances from  feet to  feet the connection drops all the time in winxp and winki was able to remove the annoying messages that the connection was dropped but nevertheless connection drops very often and internet is getting slow very slow at momentsdont buy netgear router for wireless it sucksdont buy belkin router wired or wireless its a tragedyive used a few of these with friends and determinedthe range is poor i cant even get from one sideof the house to the otheri swapped insmc units and they were finei suspect the radio is lower power than othersthe netgear g unit does much better in terms of rangeeven running at b speedsthis product worked well for about  year then it crapped out
tried calling customer service on several occasions with no luck the service line hangs up on me each time
stay away from this company unless you want to take your chancesit was good while it lasted but it didnt last that long unfortunately
the connection is ok starting out and then it fades and i had to reboot it many times
i finally switched over to cisco and its been great
but i know other netgear products have been good but not this onethe netgear mr b wireless port cabledsl router is very easy to set up and required no software
i like the firewalls and parental control options that this router provides
internet accessible from anywhere at home
and it is compatible with both windows and mac
the antenna for this model is db
though the router was easy to set up i had some difficulties in configuring it to my settings
there have been numerous instances when the connection dropped and i had to reset the router for it to function properly
this frequency of loss of connectivity is an unhealthy signgot the mr from amazon which shipped it in record time tnx amazon
i got the white unit which is ver and comes with the latest firmware from netgearvery easy to setup and install stylish and compact
however the biggest problem with this thing is it drops the internet conncetion every about tenminutes 
a search on the net has revealed this to be a common problem and is very annoying
tryed several suggestions found on the net but none did the tricki think you cud do better elsewhere especially that this issue has been found since earlier versions and continues on in the latest versions as welli regret buying this unit the mrv
i run a web server on my network and i immediately noticed a huge performance problem when accessing the pages from inside the network accessing them from outside seems fine thank goodness but i cant even upload photos to my own web site thats running on a server  feet away
id have to go to work to upload them
when i reported the problem to netgear support they first had me fiddle with the mtu setting to no avail and then finally told me since you have assigned a private ip address to the webserver i would request you to access the webserver using that ip address and check the status
which is no solution at all
youd have to access the site from the ip address inside the house and from the domain name everywhere else
and that wouldnt really even work for me because my site is comprised of dynamic php pages wordpress that refer to one another based on the domain namein short do not buy this unit if you are running a web server
there are other units out there that handle this situation the correct wayi bought the unit to replace my apple airport base station because of the extra ethernet connections
the unit is very easy to set up and has good singal strength stronger than the airport station probably due to its external and modifiable antennathe unit is of decent quality and a very sleek design
it is a little larger than i thought being very thin at the expense of width and length
good thing that it comes with a vertical stand or else it will take quite a bit of desktop space
setup was quite easy and it starts working without much effort for both my pc and macs on the networkthe unit worked well until i noticed that the port forwarding feature did not seem work reliably
it only provides for tcp connection forwarding and thre are no forwarding provided for udp connections
there are quite a few applicartions i use that seem to use udp ports and those will never work
even the tcp port forwarding sometimes failed to enable applications to work through its quotfirewallquot
applications that are widely available that had not worked well yahoo messenger with video resetting once in a while and msn messengersnetmeeting conferencing features all but ceased to function
even setting the computer to a default dmz did not solve the problem
the unreliable and sometimes apparent nonexistant port forwarding forced me to remove the router in the chain of connection
this has been nothing but headache and i am typing this sans the routeri hate to bash on a product and i am trying hard not to
however i am just an average consumer without professional demands and the router comes short even for my needs
i do not know what else is missing but the lack of udp forwarding feature and the sometimes unreliable tcp forwarding seems like a grave issue as it effectively eroded my computing experience
i dont think it would cost much more to implement such features and it would have been a real winner with such a low price and pleasing design
as of now im looking for something that has more network settings
mrs controls are pretty bare and while it may have been good at stifling confusion it also meant trouble with connections for mei have a   and have tried the  and the  leaves a great deal to be desired
it does not handle files well can read only a limited number of files does not have resume and is difficult to navigate
the older models have superior firmware
perhaps sonicblue will fix these problems with new firmware
it should have been done before release to the publicthis is an overpriced cd player
it is ultra thin yes but if you want something small you really want an ipod
using a cd player in the car is not about getting the cd player to be as small as possible  its about making it as easy to use in the car
that said here are the positivesthis cd player is cheaper than the ipodoverall dont waste your time with this productthis player is similar to the iriver imp mpcd player but a better display  lines instead of  and better accessories make the iriver unit a clear winneralso my experience with sonicblues customer service has been less than favorable and this is being kind
it has now been almost a year since i sent a broken player in for warranty repair or replacement
after half a year 
they replaced my original player with a different lower quality model sp with sp
but it has now been a year  and they still not have sent me accessories for the sp which is incompatible with the old accessoriesthis mp player is no where as good as others on market
rio took too long to get a decent product out and that too is overpriced
it skips and the sound quality isnt that great either with better sony headphoneshave you seen a uglier design than this 
probably notthere are also some nice flash based mp player from iriverthis product is not worth your time or moneyunfortunately this keyboard did not work with the g powerpc os x  i even went to macally site and downloaded the drivers for it
initially the sounds and eject dvd did not work until i installed the driver
after installing the driver the number lock never worked before or after the driver was installed
along with the fact that when i typed it started added numbers in between the letters odd glitch
so back it goesthere is a blank key to the lower right of the letter keyboard next to the arrow keys that doesnt serve any purpose except to get in the way
i havent been able to map it to any functionswhat can i say its a keyboard
the only major problem is the  keys stick
until i finally set my default to show on my screen which keys were pressed i didnt even know what was going on exactly  is the shift key stuck
maybe the command key
the shift command and option keys all stick whether or not i use them whats with thatapparently i didnt read the specs carefully enough before i ordered this keyboard for my new mac mini running snow leopard
it doesnt have all the keys or functions of an apple keyboard
for instance there is no f key on the macally
also the usb ports on the keyboard dont seem to function with many devicesin short this product may work well with older systems but i wouldnt recommend it for a new mac system
i would write a more detailed review but im so unhappy with this product that it isnt worth my time
if i had it to do over gain i would spend a few more bucks and buy the apple product in the first placethough i could almost live iwth the laptopstyle design of this attractive keyboard i could not live with the extrafriction surface the keys were given which i understand was not part of the keyboard as originally made
i ended up going back to the applesupplied keyboard and the search continuesok bare with me herei got a set of these with a purchase of a dell computer in the fall of 
the sub went bad in a matter of less than  months
the internal amp just died
just all of a sudden up and died one daycontacted logitech and they sent me a whole new set without requiring me to send them back anything
probably would have cost more in the shipping than it was worth the effort to
starting about november or december of  i noticed a rattling noise coming out of the sub
sounded like the speaker had come loose from its mount
disconnected the sub and attempted to take the grill off and see for sure
no success
couldnt get the grill off
unscrewed the back panel to have a look inside
again no success
some wiring holds the panel close to the caseanyway a little while later i started noticing crackling sounds coming from my whole speaker system
finally discovered that it was due to the sub
because the sub started to cut out on me again and when it did the crackling would stop but of course i had no bass
leaving me to believe that the internal amp was causing the cracklingthe sub continued to cut out from time to time and i could get it to kick back in by pounding on the side of the case with my closed fist
talk about getting this old bucket of bolts going again
ironically the thing has been working somewhat well for the past week or so but as of today  it looks like its finally cut out on me this time for good
so here i am looking for a replacement setbtw i will now have two complete sets of satellite speakers
if anybody needs a replacement
let me know
we can work something outedit  forgot to explain the title of my reviewi said that its a terrible design for one main reason
there is no ventilation
its an enclosed box
it also gets extremely hot which leaves me to believe that the heat is what burns out the amp
therefore im leaning towards to the ze system which includes a sub that has a blow hole for just over i bought this item back to complement my new laptop that gets pretty hot when running high end applications and computer games
it worked great but after about  weeks the plug that connects to the cooling pad became loose and the fan would only come on if i moved the cord just right
a couple weeks later it stopped working for good
i would recommend buying another cooling pad and maybe spending a little extra for a higher quality product
this cooling pad is cheap for a reason  and it makes no sense to have to buy the same thing twice
i am now looking at replacing this chillpad seeing as how it doesnt work at all anymorethe picture of this unit appears to be an older model
i had the silver version and it worked well for more than two years
it had a vent in the back to channel air out
the model i replaced it with is black but still has the same pau model number on back and is much more dependent on airflow from underneath
this means that as soon as you place it on an sofa arm or pillow or something it will immediately start to audibly strain
however it does provide a lot of airflow when unconstrained on a table or deskbut the final straw came when one of the fan blades started making a scraping noise
i lifted my computer up to see what was happening and  i kid you not  one of the fan blades came shooting out of the unit and landed two feet to my left
this thing was pointy and sharp and could have taken an eye out  if youre lucky enough to have it come out the topi want my old silver one back this one is being returnedthis is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler while it lasts
im on my third and last one its the only one i could find in my area
none of them have made it past the  month marklet me state upfront that i have no problems with the product doing what it claims to do
the product worked really well for me and i was very happy with itfor a couple weeks
the switch that turns the fans on and off is very fragile and even though i never really used the switch i generally left it on after awhile of moving the unit the cords going into and out of the switch loosened and the fans quit working
for awhile i was able to push the wires in to get the fans to run but eventually even that failed
 the company does have a warranty but they didnt seem to enthused about replacing my unit
i wanted my money back not another poorly made unit
save  your money and buy a better made unitthe good  it does the job provides cooling as expected for this price range productthe bad   exceptionally noisy
i just installed cooler master  and i thought it was broken because i could not hear it
targus was running like a motorcycleinferior quality
the left fan is malfunctioning smell of burning pvc
unfortunately out of warranty
if you can afford an expensive laptop worth cooling you can afford a better cooling padlet me put this piece of junk into the garbage bagthis notebook chill pad is a great productuntil it broke about a few months later
its not like i manhandled it either
its was quiet and it did cool the notebook off very well but since it did stop working i have to rate this lowexcellent product except that the targus chill mat has the following warning a warning that is starting to show up on far too many frequently used high contact electronic devices this product contains chemicals including lead known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm
wash hands after handling
first rationally except for the lead reference which is concerning in itself the warning is far to vague to be useful
what chemicals are we talking about
at what levels
where are the chemicals
inside out of reach in the casing or in the cord
is this a real concern or a california over reaction
none of this information is available so we get to guess at our risk
thats a game im not willing to playsecond outrage this is a product designed and marketed for lap use which means constant handling
to knowingly produce a product from a material that should require such a warning label is irresponsible  especial for a high contact item
it is also ridiculous to expect consumers to a see the fine print on the packaging it should be bold and an eyecatching b remember the warning for the life of the product there is no warning label on the chill mat only on the packaging and c be able to washing their hands after handling if you are using it on your lap its impractical to impossible to wash your hands after handling
i read the fine print to late the package is open so now im looking for a replacement that isnt knowingly toxic to the user  and for those who like made in the usa labels this is made in china
if not for the disregard for human health the warning implies i would rate this product as five stars no other problems after a few weeks of use and buy others but not now
it does what it was designed to do very well and my other half and i are vary please with its performance
ours is made of thick sturdy plastic is feather light and has quiet fans  no louder than the laptops  that saves our legs from the dell m slow broil bottom intake left vent perfect size and even help keep the laptop including the bottom cool to the touch its not unusual for me to sit with it in my lap for  hours at a time
and so far it works well with our new dell e back intake left vent inch or less overhang all sides
the only thing id like to see is one usb pass through so you dont lose a usb slot
to bad it needs a hazard warningi bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when its on my lap sitting in a chair
im very satisfied with its being able to accomplish that
however the cord ended up breaking after a few months
targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle
now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on
after a bit it settles down but very noisy at firstthe design of the targus product is fine but cheap electrical connections and cheap fans limit the life of this product to a few months if used regularly
it does keep the laptop sufficiently cool to alleviate overheating
the antec mat is better for about the same pricethis fan was easy to setup and use
it did a great job cooling off my thinkpad tp
but after only a few months of fairly normal usage no dropsexcessive wearetc the power cord connection went bad  i even tried taping it into place to hold it in better but it didnt work for longalso the plastic fins on the fan can get bent  not sure how but they do
and then they catch making that fan not work there are 
ive gone in and fixed it  mostly by removing the bent fini purchased this from staples a few months back
it worked okay but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound
it just stoppd working tonighti have owned many a laptop and several notebook cooling pads
cooling can potentially improve a computers performance and useful lifethis pad has decent performance
but it is made from cheap plastic and has design shortcomings
the product pictures and price make you think it is made from high grade plastic or metal
i feel for anybody who ever paid the list price of  for this productreading the reviews for this product i realized that several key elements of this products construction were not being mentionedpros  the fans do seem to push a decent amount of air more than other pads  the rubber risers allow for better airflow under your laptopcons  this product is made from low grade plastic
it is flimsy under the weight of any standard laptop  the rubber risers which seperate this product from your laptop will come out  they are not glued in  the rubber feet on this pad will also come out  the fans inside can be very loud  the  fan heads are poorly positioned in the center of the pad  the usb cable is too longfor the price there are simply better alternatives
the antec notebook cooler has a more durable aluminum top ergonomic shape and more quiet design
the usb connector also has an extra portantec usbpowered notebook cooleras long as you dont mind the defects this can be a handy unit for a spare or travel needs
this cooler is still worth owning if you can buy it on sale for  or less
dont pay morehappy shoppingi used this product to cool my laptop which is a server
therefore i ran this notebook cooler for  hours a day
after running it for  months i realized that one of the fan slowed down
a month later the fan stopped runningoverall i dont recommend this product
the cooling power is not strong enough especially yours is a heavy duty laptop
i recommend the one from antecantec usbpowered notebook cooler
ive run mine for  years nonstop
so far it still works greati had a problem with my laptop overheating so i picked this up
for the three weeks it worked it worked well no problems with heat whatsoever laptop was completely cool even after many hours of continuous use and the internal fans rarely had to runhowever after about three weeks it just stopped
the problem seems to be the onoff switch or connections to the switch
i would look for a different product with a sturdier constructionupdate i got a replacement for the one that stopped in the review above and even while being extremely careful with it particularly the power cord it still died after just five months
fans would either run slowly or not at all
again while the fans actually ran it did a great job of reducing heat but these dont seem to be built to lastfirst some of the description and reviews led me to believe that the fans direct hot air out of the back andor sides of the chill pad
this is not the case
the fans only blow straight through topbottom
second if the chill pad is sitting on anything  even though the legs provide a small gap the air flow is reduced to practically nothingi bought this to put on top of my directv dvr to help pull hot air away from the dvr
it actually raised the internal temperature by  degrees probably because the air flow it created was very minimal and it blocked some of the vented area on the top of the dvrgood idea but the implementation leaves it pretty worthless in my opinionwhen i first bought this product it was great
it kept my laptop cool its light weight and its very quiet
but it fell apart quickly
the onoff switch broke off and i ended up just securing the wires by hand and lots of duct tape
then the little plastic pieces over the fans broke off
granted i used this daily for two years and took it around the world a few times so i got a lot of use out of it
i suppose if you just keep it at home most of the time it would last a lot longerbtw i recently bought the newer version of this dark gray and thicker and it sucks its much louder than the older modelhave had several of these and eventually elevated a new laptop using blocksthese units bunt out quicklyfor the  they should work bettermine did help keep my dell inspiron  from getting too hot but the usb cable leaves a lot to be desired
about a month after getting mine the fans stopped working
i found the problem to be in the silly onoff switch they stuck in the middle of the cable
i removed the switch and spliced the cable
however now approximately six months after i bought the unit it appears that a wire has broken near the usb plug and as far as i know replacement usb plugs arent available
i guess now its buy a v ac adaptor and wire into the thing
needless to say im not impressedit does a good job cooling down the laptop but i use it sparingly because its so noisy
i dont know what its db rating is but its certainly not like a typical pc fan
its like five times louder than a typical pc fan
if theres a different chill pad thats quieter id get onedefective when it got here
the fan on only one side turns and it doesnt cool very well at thatthe ups unit itself works just fine
it kicks in properly when power fails allowing me to save my work and safely shut down my computer
it even automatitcally shuts down the computer when im not available to do so myselfhaving said that apcs customer support is downright horrible
i contacted them concerning an issue with a recent software upgrade explaining the situation in some detail two paragraphs and asking for a possible resolution
i received a poorly written canned response in return which did not relate at all to anything i had said
this happened again following two more followup messages
either they were not reading or could not understand what i was writingangry at this point i sent another message including all the previous messages and replies bluntly asking for this message to be delivered to someone who spoke english and could actually read what was sent
to my surprise i received a response saying it was being sent to the software developers who would respond in detail
however a few days later i received a message stating that since i had not contacted the company in some time my problem had apparently been resolved
of course it had not been resolved  i was still waiting for the promised responsei gave up at this point
i never did receive a response from the software people nor has the issue been resolved to this day
this company has apparently outsourced their customer support to a thirdworld country using employees whose command of the english language is questionable at best
this was insufficient to handle even a relatively minor issue like mine
further im not exactly thrilled about the loss of american jobs as a result of overseas outsourcing obviously american is only good enough to use in a company name
therefore since im buying a new computer this week ill look for another company who takes customer support and american workers more seriously
i urge others to consider the same optionit did its job for a bit over a year but then the battery died and needs to be replaced
the replacement battery is  plus shipping so you are better off just buying a new oneonly three out of the six plugs are actually back up supported plugs and the other three are only surge protected no battery back up at all
so if you need more than three you need a larger more expensive unitthe software is easy to use and connects to the pc via usb connectionfirst let me say i dont often write reviews for amazon
but this item was so disappointing i felt the need to do so
this product has several small problems that add up  the battery died after less than  months
i have several other units that have been in use much longer and are still running fine the on battery power alarm cannot be shut off
you must put up with the annoyance until you power down your equipment and turn the unit off
unless you are connected to a pc wasting a usb port
its not
it was connected to a mac
 the replace battery alarm cannot be shut off
you must put up with the annoyance until you replace the battery or turn the unit off  turning off your equipment i hate it when moron designers think they know better than i do on how i will place my equipment
this unit comes with the power plug angled to the right which typically is the wrong direction for my placementthe previous model beu did not last long did not know if it was the battery or the electronics
but the price of the new units when on sale did not make purchasing a battery see worthwhileif you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device
lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried
the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps
they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage even though the modem wasnt hurti would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime
under a w load it only lasted  minutes while the backups es  lasted almost  minutes
the es  is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime
in my opinion this ups is only good for very small loads less than the average computershort review
they arent durable at all
click off for no reason while other things in the house still have  power then come back on just as unexpectedly
i wont bother with anotheri received this mp player as a freebie throwin with my dell computer
if i had actually paid any money for it let alone the actual sales price i would have returned this zerostar performer in a flashthe only upside to it is its design simplicity  part of the unit detaches plugs into any usb port and is then recognized as a portable drive
from there you just move files intoout of the player just like any other drive
no additional software installs setup etc
 true plug and playunfortunately the cons are much more numerous
the most disappointing aspect is the sound from the illfitting earbuds that deliver the thinnest of tones to the playback unit that chops off the first millisecond of every track
that latter fact really makes this unit completely unacceptable
also the lack of any lcd display coupled with buttons that are small and difficult to use make control a constant problem as well
capacity is soso  ive had to lop tracks off of many albums that ive attempted to load
lastly the packaged unit doesnt come with any armband  its available as a separate accessory which seems excessive for the pricethis player is fine only if you can find one for dirt cheap and are looking for an option to use when youre mowing the lawn or any other dirty activity where youd be reluctant to bring your quotrealquot mpthis is a great product while it works
it is compact reliable and easy to use just drag your music files to the player as if it were a removable disk drivebut beware it will fail
i had three and all failed completely within a year  one within two months
once your player fails you are pretty much out of luck
creative support is almost nonexistent but if you can track it down you will have to pay  to have them quotlook at itquot and ultimately nearly  to replace it
in this products defense it could be pointed out that many mp players have a limited lifetime eg
even the ipods batteries run down within a couple years and are costly or impossible to replace so it could be argued that product failure is not in itself a reason to avoid this product thats why it doesnt get just one star
but the muvo just doesnt last long enough to be worth the price two months of  mb of music for  or  mb for  just doesnt compare with a year or more of many gigabytes for a couple hundred even the overpriced porsche of players the ipod mini can he had for a friend gave me this as a gift which im glad she did because im not sure if id want to pay for itthe good things about the player is that its very simplistic
it only has two pieces to it so you dont have to worry abot a bunch of cables or anything
you slide out the flash drive plug it into your usb port and start copying files to it directly from windows explorer which recognizes it as an additional hard drive
the player will hold around  mp songs encoded at kbps
this is plenty for someone like me who only runs for  minutes
its also nice to have a flash drive that i can easily transfer files with
i have not experienced any effect of the player cutting off the first second of each song like another reviewer said
every song starts right up at the beginningthe cons at first i couldnt do anything with this device until i formatted it
windows would recognize it but not let me remove or copy any files to it
i tried it on several computers and could only listen to the songs already on it until i found the format software but it works great now
the player doesnt have an lcd screen so you cant see what song is playing although this isnt really a problem with only mb of storage space
another problem is that it didnt come with the armband
you have to order it seperately from creative
for a portable mp player designed to be used with exercise this is ridiculous
for the price they should have thrown it in or at least put a belt clip on it
i have to wear shorts with pockets in them to carry it with me when i run
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around
the armband would have prevented all this
the player does come with some earphones that suck and a neck loop that is great if you run in the woods or at night where no one can see what an idiot you look likethe player also features a loop button that allows you to start recording a point in one of your songs press a button and it will loop the section you recorded over and over
i have no idea what the point of this was or why they wasted time with it
as far as i can tell it is completely uselessmy biggest complaint is the battery life
it holds one aaa battery
this is nice for the compact size but i would have rather it been slightly larger and held tow batteries
i like my music up pretty loud and my battery is dead after  minutes
that is unacceptable
ive seen reviews that say the battery life lasts  hours at  volume
i have never seen that
i have to buy batteries in bulk just to be able to use it
whats more the muvo will actually drain amps from your battery when its turned off
for the life of me i cant figure out why
its a flash drive so there should be zero reason it needs to keep power up
it is not very significant but if you put a brand new battery in and dont turn it on at all in about two months the battery will be dead from the drain
wma files also consume more battery usage than mp filesthe player also has a skip button that lets you skip tracks and fast forward but it can act flaky on wma files and instead of seeking through a song just skip right to the beginning
there is also no repeat feature
after the last song you have to hit play again to restart it
no random song feature eitheralthough this player is pretty much outdated now it would be a decent player
i like the basic design and the controls are easy to use
its just not worth the current price and it has too many flaws to use for serious athletesafter reading the glowing reviews i ordered the mx eagerly anticipating a performance jump from my year old microsoft blue optical mouse
the mouse is attractive and well built
i rather like the quotheftquot some people complain of and the design is comfortable
the problem is performance
the pointer is erractic quivering shaking pointer with quotghostquot images flashing behind it and the software is extremely buggy either from the cd or logitechs site numerous crashes that ended when i uninstalled the mouseware drivers
plus the cd installed backweb lite to faciltate online registration and updates
little did i know that that particular program is considered spyware by many spyware removal programs
thats really a shock from a company like logitech
all in all i was very dissapointed with the mx
i went back to my old ms blue optical downloaded the lastest drivers from microsoft and it runs rings around the logitech and is much more stablethe mouse works great
installation was a breeze the mouse functions exactly as i hoped it would
it looks great on my deskbutthe included driver disk tries to install all sorts of garbage along with the mouseware software
included on the disk are quotebay shortcutquot presumably a browser helper object but im not going to install it to find out logitech resource center yay more stuff in my system tray
slow computers are fun
 musicmatch barf and wildtangent gamechannel
wildtangent is known spyware
it gets better thoughif you opt to install the quotlogitech messenging centerquot which purports to keep you notified about driver and software updates it installes backweban even more insidious piece of spyware than wildtangent
this is completely unacceptable
if im going to pay this much for a mouse i should not be expected to then give up even more in the form of my privacyshame on you logitech
id give this mouse  stars if it werent for all the sneaky stuff on your driver diski have windows xp but the installation program for the mx froze my computer
after hours on the phone with techs they told me the only way this mouse would work on my computer would be if i didnt install the features the extra buttons provide
it would be tempting to just return it to the store but i do like the fact that its cordless and has a rechargeable base
thats why im giving it two stars instead of oneive owned and used this mouse for about  weeks and heres my experiencefirst the plusesgreat sleek lookscharger built into the receiver unitworks great on flat surfaces onlylow battery led indicatorthe minusestracking is terrible on all other surfaces ie  carpet blanket couch fabric matress etclogitech drivers will disable certain built in features of windows xp many incompatibility issues wother softwarerange is worse than the ms intellimouse explorer wirelessif your mouse sits on a desk all day i honestly dont think you need a wireless mouse
however if you need the range versatility and freedom because you have a living roombedroomfamilyroom pc setup where you may want to use the mouse on some surface other than a desktop wireless is the way to gobut logitech is definitely not the way to goi couldnt believe how horrible this product performed after reading so many rave reviews about it so i returned my first mx for another brand new one but that one still had the same problems
i guess none of the reviews tested this unit on other surfaces besides a desktopfeel free to buy the mx and test it out on your own but if you plant to use this mouse on anything but a flat surface make sure you save your receipt and box because youll most likely want to return it later
i gave my mx away to my little brother who will use it at his desk exclusively and i went out and bought the ms intellimouse explorer wireless and to my surprise ive never had a single tracking problem using it on textured and nonflat surfaces
weve even wrinkled up a blanket and tested both mice  the msiew worked flawlessly the mx was a joke
even my little brother wants to ebay his mx now and get the msiewsome ppl complain about the msiews lag time due to its sleep mode and its only about sec all i do is nudge the mouse as i place my hand on it to wake it up before i use it and that works fine
trust me its alot less inconvenient than you think and a whole heck of alot less frustrating than watching your cursor jitter and dance all over your screen because of tracking problemsbottom line is if youre only going to use your mouse on a desk get this onebut if you need your mouse to work on a wide range of surfaces get the msiew
personally i think the whole point of wireless is that you dont plan to use your mouse on a desk because if its less wires on your desk that youre after remember that every wireless device needs to have a receiver on the desk and that my friend still has wires
until they come up with a wireless receiver for the wireless receiver phopefully someday either logitech or microsoft will combine the best features of these two mice into one productand it lasted only for a yr and half before the laser started jumping around the charge would not hold and the tracking became sloppy
not really worth the money you spend on a mouse you want to keep for at least  yrsi regret the money i spent in this mouse
yes it does have some nice features but the performance is poor moreover in high memoryconsuming applications like games
the performance is jerky and the worst is the scrolling wheel that is simply uncontrollable
i am replacing a microsoft intellimouse explorer corded and there is simply no comparisonthelogitech usb optical mouse with wire tracks hand movement so much better than this mx wireless that i retired the wireless mx
the mxs software doesnt allow enough slow speed selections but gives many fast motion speeds that are impractical to use
ive run the mx on a mac under os  and on windows xp with the same poor results
had the same problem with microsoft wireless mouse even though tried every driver configuration possible for all mice
the bywire optical is the most accurate mouse ive used so i bought one for my mac and windows machines
when using the usb port on my sonnetech addon board on the mac computer the logitech software control is lost but the click button and good tracking still work kensington software according to sonnettech support does work for kensington mouse products
ive really lost some money on mouse products
hope my pain helps someone out therei like everything about this tripod except for the horrid pinch points on the leg clamps
i will often get blood blisters on my fingers or hand from unsnapping the legs due to the faulty design that allows skin to easily get caught during the unclamp procedure
this usually happens when im trying to unclamp the legs quietly or am trying to keep the unclamp lever from rebounding
take a close look at the leg clamping mechanism and you will be amazed at how easily it can pinch skin
ive been bitten by mine more times than i can count
i have now painted the pinch points bright red to remind myself to be careful
other than that its a wonderful versatile tripod
just more painful than it needs to beafter listening to many speakers back to back while i was sampling what units i would like to try out i listened to the s
i have to say they were the worst sounding speakers in the placewe bought the bose  as a compact speaker system for a small room to replace a larger older bose bookshelf system
we picked the  based on the bose name and our previously positive experience with their productsunfortunately the  has very poor bass response
the highs and midreange are clear but without the bass end of the sound spectrum the sound is flat almost tinny
we returned the product to bose and got a prompt refundnot recommendedi bought these as the surround channel speakers with polk audio front and center channel speakers
granted that surrounds are effect speakers but these you hardly heard a peep out of them ever
when you did it sounded like a transistor radio
is there a reason that bose does not publish frequency response and impedance data for these
i replaced them with polk audio tsis and without changing any settings  wow now thats what were talking about
i would not recommend buying these bose s for an application like minewell after years of resisting the bose craze i finally tasted the koolaid
and never again
look i have a large deck and had been using a pair of yamaha nsaww outdoor speakers powered by a decent w sony receiver
i was very happy with the yamahas but after several years of hard exposure to the elements they had served their purpose
so i decided to replace those with the boseand i am horribly disappointed
the bose speakers just sound like mud
the high and low ends are very lousy and not even as good as speakers that cost  the amount of these bose units
i reconnected the yamahas briefly to make sure my amp had not hatched a transistor or something but sure enough the fault lies in the speakersthe goodi was very happy to see the bose units were made in mexico not china
and the styling is very good with easy installation
the sound distribution is also quite good in that there is no single sweet spot for uniform stereo coverage
hats off to bose on the coverage that is impressivethe badalthough the speakers were well packaged one of the wire terminals were broken off right out of the boxthe uglyi was not opposed to spending close to  for a premium set of speakers
however when the sound is inferior to speakers costing much less that is unforgivablewell live and learn i guessthese are good speakers but at this price you can buy  pairs of comparable yamaha nsaw speakers
in sidebyside testing i did not have a preference
check out the yamahas before you make a final decisioni compared this lens to a sigma mm f the canon mm was softer at the same f stop on both lenses
neither lens is a great lens with the sun in frame which i expected with the sigma since it is designed for speed
the canon mm is not that fast of a lens at f so i thought i would use it as a sunset lens
the lens makes a horrible triangle shaped flare along with other rainbow patterns
the lens also did poorly with shooting a skyline at night
i was disappointed maybe stopped down it would look better but that point your at f   and there are plenty of lenses stopped down that look great
also manually setting at infinity wide opened seemed slightly off the mark i only shoot manual since i am a professional and use a loupe to always check focus but i was also hoping to have a lens i could pull out in a dark moonlit landscape and know for sure where infinity is
might as well shoot though a lens capthis lens looks on the surface to be a great allpurpose lens and at first the pictures looked a step up from mycanon powershot ais mp digital camera with x optical image stabilized zoom
it has image stabilization and a good range i thought it would be a good general purpose lens
i quickly became disillusioned with the results many pictures where out of focus so i thought i would compare it against my other lenses
what i discovered surprised me
i took the cost effective mm lens the mm macro lens the mm is lens the kit mm and the mm and took the same pictures at focal lengths of mm and mm of a batik where possible
i made sure i had adequate lighting to avoid camera shake  watts total plus all pictures were above th second which i thought might be the culprit and took a series of photos with each lens at f
the worst lenses by far were the  and the  which gave about the same results
whilst the mm macro lens from the same distance and the mm is and often the mm showed the grain of the canvas on which the art was imprinted the mm and the  were not sharp at all and sometimes downright blurry
this was at a distance of about  meters  feet
there were  test pictures in every single one the mm macro lens gave the best result just ahead of the surprisingly good is
the  was very disappointing
i think the sample was wide enough to eliminate operator error
i wondered if my camera was failing to autofocus properly but the results with the mm are perfect  times out of  often even when working at macro ranges with autofocus on and bad  with the mmin short avoid this lens if you want crisp pictures
get instead thecanon  lens   mm  f ii  canon efthough some say the f is better i might agree but its over  times the price and this is definitely a step up from the  and also thecanon ef mm f macro usm lens for canon slr cameras
it wont set you back that much more and youll get much better pictures and be able to do macro work
you might argue that the mm end would be missing but the kit lens takes as good photos as this lens so youre not missing much except perhaps better manual focus but i would imagine few are using manual focus with this lensother problems you may find are that the zoom barrel will extend of its own accord if you point the camera downward
i also found that i had to take two or three pictures at a time to get one that was anywhere near in focus and correctly exposed
lens certainly wont just snap the moment first time i dread to think what it would be like on action shotswhen i got this lens the first thing that i noticed was its poor build quality
when i spend several hundred bucks for a lens i expect that the mechanical bits will behave like they were built to strict tolerances
when a lens clearly does not meet those high standards i return it
i returned two copies of this lens
at this point ive given up and concluded that canons quality control at least for this particular lens has absolutely gone into the toiletthe main build quality problem is the way the zoom mechanism operates
when you turn the zoom ring on a wellbuilt zoom lens it moves fairly easily without sticking but it exhibits some drag throughout the range and absolutely does not move on its own
with this lens by contrast if you tilt the lens vertically it slams its way to nearly the maximum zoom settingnot quite all the way because the last part of the zoom range is much tighter than the first part but most of the way
so the zoom action has way too little drag in most of its range and vastly inconsistent drag
i saw this problem on both copies of the lens and the problem was even worse with a filter attachedto make this more alarming this severe lens creep problem isnt a consistent problem with these lenses
ive read multiple folks on the internet who say that they returned these lenses to canon for repairs for unrelated problems and got back tight lenses that worked as they should
this suggests that canon has wildly inconsistent quality control on these lenses and that they just dont care enough to fix the problem
thats deeply disturbingthe problem with lens creep is not just that the lens can change focal length on you without you intending to do so it also means that the lens takes a lot of abuse during normal use
when you take it off the camera and put it in a bag for example it slams its way to the telephoto end of its range every time
when you tilt your camera down it moves
every time it moves in an uncontrolled way it is likely putting stress on various parts inside the lens and that is almost guaranteed to reduce the life expectancy of the lens compared with a lens that moves less frequentlyive used canon lenses for many years including a wide range of ef and efs lenses
ive never seen anything remotely approaching this level of lens slop in any of them
it is simply unacceptably poor build quality
from what ive seen i would strongly urge anyone considering these lenses to go with the  instead
it is a much much better lens
im not talking about a small difference here
the  just plain feels like a toy by comparisoni terribly miss the extra reach that i used to get with my  on a crop body but its not worth dealing with a lens that is this sloppy
i guess ill just have to wait for the rumored  ii and hope that canon gets their build quality right the second time aroundwhile this lens takes pretty good pictures i cant endorse its purchase
when i received the lens it looked like it was in good condition so i installed it on my camera
i quickly realized that autofocus was not working properly
after testing different shots and different conditions the autofocus would only move every so often and the camera would not take pictures because the af wasnt working
when af did work it was very slow and sluggish
after awhile it wouldnt work at all
i brought it to a local camera store and they diagnosed it as a bad motor all other lenses work on my camera so it was not the camerathe lens worked fine with manual focus and i dont have any complaints about the picture qualityim not sure if the bad lens motor was due to canons qc or if was due to the infamous subpar packaging of lenses from amazon
either way the lens was defective and was sent backi care for three things in a lens  image quality ease of use and overall weight
ive used this lens on my canon d for over a year with the following resultsimage quality the lens is not capable of delivering a truly sharp image under any conditions
it is not sharp by design
this problem is exacerbated by the is device when it is engaged
furthermore there is significant lateral ca uncorrectable multicolored fringing at the edges of the image
the lens is prone to flaring even with the shade attached
the autofocus is not accurate  the only way to actually focus the lens with autofocus is to zoom to mm focus and then recompose after disengaging the autofocus
it is much easier and more precise to focus manually
there is significant amount of complex distortion at all focal lengths which is not fully correctable in photoshop but may be fully corrected using the pt lens which has a customized profile for it
the color balance of the lens is fairly bland but can be boosted in both camera and photoshop so this is probably not an issue
this being said the lens delivers its best at fease of use considering all of the above the lens can only be used in manual focusing mode and without the is
it does not bother me much but for people who is buying this lens for autofocus and image stabilization capabilities this is a deal breakeroverall weight this lens is unreasonably heavy and bulky for what it is
it uses a whooping mm filter yet its maximum aperture is nothing to write home about
it is very uncomfortable in the fieldconclusion i would use this lens primarily as general purpose portrait lens and it will proably do ok i would not use or recommend it for even casual landscape or any other tuype of photography  it just does not deliver the quality it should for the money
i am going to sell it in the near futuregreat range and the usm provides quite and fast auto focus
the is works wellwhile the lense takes sharp photos at extreme zoon at all other settings the pictures were fuzzy
not sure if its bad glass or a problem with auto focusingnot worth the money but it may be that i got a bad copy of the lense like so many others here havei wanted this lense to work but ended up returning ithad some issues returning it but as always amazon worked with me and the lense is on its way backthis lense works well in low light and is built strong and runs smoothly but it annoyingly telescopes out when hanging due to the weight of the glass
when i manually zoom with it it has an annoying plastic on plastic squeeking noise
it does not affect the fuction but is annoying as helli ordered this lens about  years ago and right out of the box the af motor sounded like it was too tightmade a highpitched almost abrasive sound whenever it would focus
being the first prime lens i got for my ti i didnt suspect anything at first
after about  months the af stopped working entirely
i sent it off to canon to fix under a warranty claim and they had it back to me in about  weeks
from that point it worked for about another  months before reverting back to the same state of disrepair
i resolved to just use mf on it however just having this lens attached to my camera nearly instantly drains even a fullbatterymust be some kind of short in itregardless of the failed mechanics and weird behavior the glass was good and i really liked the way it handled indoor lightgreat colors and warm tone nice fov
nonetheless this lens is basically worthless to me now and just sits in the top of my closet
because of this experience i am very weary to invest in more canon lenses and have since only purchased sigma lenses with mixed emotions there as well
one dayill get a good onehopefullyi see where this camera is selling used for 
lets face it
this was a great camera  years ago but  no way
time has passed it by
i realize its built like a tank and has a fast burst rate but in every other way a new  dslr is superior
in my opinion if you pay more than  youre wasting your money unless youre a collector maybe
the iq can be matched in most ways by a new ps camerai like this product and bought it about  weeks ago
now the price was raised by over  will wait to buy again until price is reduced againupdate  may    from the photo it looks like a different version of the product than the one i purchased in march the filter is fine but when i screw it onto a bw uv filter it jams and i cant get it off
i must put both in the freezer for a few minutes in order to get them separated
the ambient temperature makes no difference
tried to save a little money and now i regret it
should have bought the bwhad a cheaper tiffen polarizer from a previous mm camera that does a much better job that this supposedly upgraded filter
only a slight difference when used and not worth the money
one major complaint is the filterdoes not have a serrated rim which makes it extremely difficult to grab on tight enough to remove it from the camera lensive purchased hoya filters in the past and was very satisfied
i didnt realize until the filter arrived that it was multicoated and had serious reflection problems
also the filter had the hoya name but was made by tokina
i am familiar with tokina lenses but didnt realize they had glas making capbilities
did they buy hoya filters
i strongly recommend anyone buying a hoya polarizing filter buy only one that has the hmc hoya multicoatedlabeling
multicoated polaring filters are a must as one of their primary purposes is to reduce reflectionsi installed this card on my vista box and was surprised the quality wasnt better than the integrated audio
as well the signal strength was much weaker
i had the most recent drivers installed to no availcheersill start off by saying that im a full time working professional
i work day in and day out with a variety of different nikon equipment and this is the first time ive felt compelled to leave a review for anything in the systemthe short i dont believe this lens is up to the task of being paired with the newest generations of nikon camera bodies and suffers from major softness issues and horrible cathe long both copies of this lens that i used were tested on both a d and a d and i saw the same poor results from both
the biggest flaw with the lens is that it simply is not sharp at f
the first copy i received wasnt acceptably sharp until f or f and the second copy was only marginally better
if youre using it exclusively for portraits or in otherwise excellent lighting conditions its not too bad who wants razor sharp portraits anyway
however as soon as the light dips or youre shooting something requiring sharpness and critical focusing this lens becomes virtually worthless
the other major issue is the ca
jumpin junipers its bad
i can honestly say that i have never used a lens of any kind brand or cost with ca as bad as what i saw with this one
even catch lights in a subjects eye showed ca for heavens sakeone last note if youre a bokeh junkie this still may be the lens for you
beautiful bokehive been taking photos for decadesi own a great deal of nikon gear from the f to latermodels like the n an excellent camera btwincluded in my collection is the nikon fmproduced in the early to mids and made as cheaplyas possible this is an ok starter or spare camerabut it is not a nikon
it was manufactured by chinona company that assembled models for olympus pentax and nikonall using this same body and lensthis camera enjoyed sales in a student generated marketas the rz  using the same lens as sold by ritz and kitsthe rz is a cheap useable camerathe fm models sold here on amazon are overpriced capitalizingon the market value of the nikon namethe fm is an ok camera but it is no nikonif yours must be a nikon buy a different modelthe polk audio atrium  speakers are pretty well made with gold plated terminals
they do not look cheapi intended to use the speakers as backsurround in a  setup based on the raving reviews herei found that the polk speaker sounds very muddy compared to my inexpensive axiom mi bookshelf speakers that i use for my front and surround channelsi then compared the polk with the cheap and tiny ma audio speakers at a quarter of the polks price in my sun room
again the ma audio speakers sounded crystal clear but lacking in bass understandably compared to the polki have no idea why the polk atrium  speakers received such favorable reviews
may be the reviewers listened to the polks without comparing them to others pro i really prefer the fabric covered ear pads
very comfortablecon the sound of these headphones is very disappointingthe package says enhanced bass and the bass is definitely enhanced to the point of being ridiculous
these provide indistinct throbbing muddy bass that makes you ears hurt after a short time
you can correct some of this with drastic eq settings by why should you have to do thatother users say that a  hour breakin period helps but if anything that made things worsei think this is an attempt by sennheiser to satisfy the same people who think  good sound means rattling windowsquantity instead of qualityif you think overdriven car stereos that make the ground vibrate are cool these are for you
but if you prefer balanced sound with rich bass look elsewherevery good sound but the materials are cheap and noisy
also they were deign for a head of a  year old child way too tighti would have to agree with most of the reviews below the sound quality you get from these headphones is pretty darn good however they have one major flaw it is impossible to wear these things for mare than  minutes without accquiring a massive headache
the people that designed these things must have been too focused on sound quality to pay any attention to comfort or even style for that matter these things look cheap and clunky on your head
i dont care how great the sound is on these things they were useless to me because i couldnt listen to anything for an extended period of time
im returning them asap and getting myself a pair of sonys yah im a sellout but atleast theyre comfortable
i would suggest the mdrvs my roommate has a pair and i really cant tell the difference in sound quality when i compared my sennheisers to his sonys after playing around with the eq of course and theyre about the same price as these too
might i also suggest the mdrxds theyre the ones i ordered as a replacement for these and ill be writing a review for those monstsers once i get a chance to try them out
two stars instead of one only because i admit the sound quality was decent not spectacular like many of the reviews said howeverim sure for a photographer with a still camera  this tripod is fine but i bought this for a camcorder and quickly found out i should have spent the money on a better tripodthe quick release head doesnt work very well with my camcorder and twice ive had to catch my camera from falling off the tripodso basically the lesson is dont be cheap when buying a tripod for a videocameraive had this tripod for  years and have handled it carefully but one of  the leg clamps broke and pretty much rendered it useless
can not recommend this productthe work professional in the headline is misplaced
compared to a professional tripod this is wobbly
i cant even press the shoot button on my a without noticing the legs move
i have a dx for my spotting scope should have just bought another one
i bought this because it had the crank vertical head but really dont know if it will be usable
anyhow the a has a  sec timer so i guess ill just use thatthe   disc unit
my first one lasted three years lasted up to a few days before the extended warrantee expired
it kept hunting for a disc endlessly and would not play
the unit was replaced with a new one and the replacement lasted just over one year ending with the same problem just beyond factory warrantee
i advise against the  unit
the company i bought it from stated the model had some problems stars was because it had nice features looked nice easy to set up had a delete file of the tracks i dont like and played well when it worked
unreliable but maybe good if you get a  year extended policy and plan to take it infor the dollars i saved purchasing new i have to say i am disappointed
the sound is the final word
the cd player itself is in need of repair
often have skips on tracks and the sound at times is muffled or tinty sounding
not sure what it will cost to get the actual player repaired or replaced but im guessing if i would have bought new i wouldnt be facing this issuei have had this cd changer for many years
except for a few minor irritants at the beginning i have been satisfied with it
but a few days ago it died
when i say died i mean in the grave absence of vital signs nada zip nothing crapped out zero down the ser
i am not going to replace irt with same device
ill try something differentbought the unit in   nothing difficult about using it or interfacing it with an amp
i was extremely happy with it and my main bitch has always been the way the player abruptly begins playback on any given cd
it skips  to  second of the first track of any cd but other than that i was ok with it
it never chewed up any cds and played burned discs just fine
recently it began skipping
upon further investigation i determined the price to exchange it for a refurb would be apx  plus sh plus tax
right
like i couldnt add thirty bucks to it and buy a new model sh free from this sitesince im in the market for a new juke and since ive read the reviews here regarding chewing up cds ill be purchasing another player not manufactured by sony since the possibility exists the next cdpcx i purchase may ruin my collectionive had two of them
first one died exactly  days after purchase
still played just tried to load from every empty slot as well as the full ones so it spent much of its time cycling rather than playingsecond one lasted longer but now simply loads disk after disk and wont play any of themmy experience with microprocessorbased sony gear is that sooner or later their brains get scrambled like the highend sony cd player in my car which is junk after only  monthsi think ive bought my last sony equipment and would not recommend this unitother objections even when it worked long cycle time noisy operation size clumsy interfacegood lucki bought this item because im embarking on that rite of passage into middle age transferring my lps to digital files
so i bought a usbenabled turntable  the record cleaner kit
as is clearly shown in the picture the kit consists of a pad pad tray  a  oz bottle of cleaning solution
youre supposed to sweep the record with the dry pad apply  drops of the cleaning fluid to the edge of the pad resweep  then do a final sweep with a dry portion of the pad
ive encountered at least  problems with this product poorly writtennonupdated instructions  youre supposed to sweep the record in the direction of the arrows on the handle well there are no arrows on the handle i can only hope that the fibers of the pad are not directional inadequate wicking of the cleaning fluid  the  drops of fluid dont spread out very well  as a result theres a tendency to clean only narrow tracks of the record lack of a cleaning tool or at least some instructions for the pad itself  where does all that dirt youve cleaned off of the record go
onto the pad where it stays until perhaps its deposited onto the next recordi can remember back in the day buying record cleaning kits that had none of these deficiencies
apparently the folks that made those products have gone the way of the buggy whip manufacturersafter favorable reviews on this unit from amazoncom and many other reputable sites i was initially very pleased to have found what i though was going to be a well built good sounding radio that was a bargaininitially after recieving the radio i turned it on and was impressed by the relatively clear and full sound it produced
i immediately moved it to my nightstand where it was going to serve as my primary listening post for my ipod as i drifted off to sleepwhen it came time to go to bed and the house was quiet i turned on the radio and noticed a relatively loud hissing noise was coming from the unit even when the volume was turned all the way down
this noise is louder than my airconditioning intake vent outside my bedroom door and my oreck air purifier on the other nightstand when they are both working at the same timewhen i got up it was not as loud
from what i can tell if this radio is earlevel such as on a nightstand  you can hear a lot of electronic noise and hissing coming from the unit
it doesnt matter what setting the unit is on fm am aux the noise is still there
when trying to listen to a song on a low volume the hissing noise takes away some of the midrange and interferes with the high tones and if it is tuned very low you can hear more hissing than music
i was so dissapointed because this was my birthday present from my wife this yearnot wanting to give up and rereading the reviews i decided to exchange the unit for a second unit instead of getting a refund
amazon was excellent about sending me another unit at no charge overnight
kudos to amazon customer service for treating me very well during this whole processi got the second unit today and guess what same problem
im dissapointed because i dont think there is anything else in this price range that suits my needs
the boston acoustics unit doesnt have aux inputs and the cambridge unit has gotten poor reviews for its build qualityso despite the excellent reviews this unit has gotten mine did not live up to expectations
maybe they have moved their production facilities to make more money as both of my units were made in china and sounded like it
this unit is going back tomorrowfine sound when you get it
the tuner is a weak point the main symptom being fm channel drift
it either has poor phaseloop locking or some other flaw
cant recommend thisi picked up a couple tivoli audio model one radios at my local target when they were closing them out  apparently budgetconscious shoppers werent buying them at the retail price of  so they reduced them to  apiece to get rid of them
for that price they are impossible to beat
for the new retail price that tivoli has set which is even higher now  i would advise looking elsewherewhile i wanted to love the tivoli i found its ability to pull in stations and its overall quality level acceptable but not exceptionalits minimalistic aesthetics are undeniably appealing but you will soon realize that it really isnt built that well
the unit feels toylike and the sound while smooth isnt nearly as extraordinary as some reviews posted here will lead you to believelow midrange frequencies are overemphasized resulting in a chesty and boomy sound and there is no highfequency sparkle
it might be fine for nearfield listening on a desktop next to a computer for instance but not much else
given their price premium there is much more value to be had investing in real stereo componentsincidentally i also picked up the tivoli radio combo  which consists of a model one the cd player and an extra speaker  for under  on clearance
adding a second speaker to the one helps but the cd player is quirky and limited in its functionality and the full combo is absurdly overpriced for what you get incredibly it now retails for i know i will probably get flamed for expressing my opinion that there are better buys out there for the money but  having tried much of tivolis line i also got the three on clearance  i felt obligated to offer a little perspectivethanks to tivolis everincreasing pricing structure i was able to sell all my tivoli gear for x what i paid for it  and then invested the proceeds in some quality bookshelf speakers and stereo components  which outperform the tivoli in every measurable way
couldnt be happier with that decisiondont fall for the marketing hype
listen first
compare before buyingwhatever you may have heard this tivoli product is not the apple of radios
i in fact didnt even take the wrapper off so i cannot comment anything about functionality or radio performance
i paid  because i expected a very high end product with nice wood and a classy appearance
the wood looks like cheap pine mine was maplehunter and the overall look is idential to a childs toy that they would get for a gift
i returned it same day
if youre expecting something special you need to look elsewhere this is a rip offi bought two of these units about a year ago
the audio is amazing for for the small size it can really fill up the room
i have not tested the am tuning but the fm tuner constantly drifts
every  to  min you start to hear a bit of distortion in the station
you have to go and bump the frequency up a bit then all is well again
when it does tune into a station the sound is wonderful for another  min
i can tune both of these units along with a digital pll receiver on my stereo to the same station leave the house for  hours and both tivolis have drifted far enough off the signal that you cannot tell what is playing on the radio from all the distortion the digital receiver is still locked in and playing perfectlyfor sound for pound i give this unit  stars
however the tuner section gets a solid  since this is an amfm radio i would think the tuner is important enough to the function to justify a  star ratingi liked the kloss relationship the radios design had  sounded like it would be great
i nearly waited too long  but ultimately found a brand new one at target at a decent price
initially i was elated  analog tuning initially was great audio was quite good for a tabletop
i noticed it had no afc automatic frequency control  compensates for thermal drift off the station you are listening to
it often masks weaker stations so its lacking was actually a good thing if a tad aggravating after an hour or so
 but the real problem  noisey controls  is the achilles heel
the volume control and function switch cleaned up but the slight crackle as you turned the tuning knob when it was a couple of months old worsened quickly making it trying to tuneemails to tivoli were finally answered before it was out of its warranty
no offer to repair it was made
they said to tune the tuner from one extreme to the other repeatedly  to spread the lube under the ground wiper on the tuning capacitor
i was ahead of them having worked my way through hs  college as a radiotv repairman and had spritzed said wiper with a contact cleaner
it worked great  for a day or two  then i tried their suggestion
it worked for two or three days  and required no dissection
still  the most important component to make in a decent form in an analog tuner is the variable capacitor  and they really cut corners there
unacceptable
i had tried the boston acoustics table hd radios  missed them locally
target had the horizon solo model out  no power so it couldnt be tested
amazon had them for   free sh  had to try one
its audio isnt as clear  but its digital tuner works
its a far better choice
both radios are nearly  now  the ba is far better
i gave the model one two stars for its decent sound  more transparent than the ba  by a smidgen
sorry model one i wanted to like youi own several upscale table radios from different manufacturers but i had wanted a tivoli for a long time
the tivoli is by far the most attractive
it is also the most tonally balanced
i disagree with other reviewers who say that it has too much bass our sounds boomy on voice and i dont think that it would benefit much from basstreble control
the tivoli is in fact less boomy than my boston acoustic receptor and solo radios
the tivoli also has more detailed mids and highs
however it also manufactured using extremely cheap internal components that deteriorate in an unacceptably short period of time
within a month mine started to cut out and i had to wiggle the volume control to get it to turn back on
then after about six months the same thing started to happen with the tuning dial
i unpluged it opened it up and carefully so as not to muck up the walnut case sprayed contact cleaner from radio shack yup into the switches and now its working again
a product called deoxit f available on amazon should do the same however you shouldnt have to do this well not within the first  years of use anyway
also am reception in my area on my unit is abysmal dont use it anyway and fm reception is not as good as other radios
finally the little tuning light really doesnt help you tune at all
you have to tune the thing by ear
overall id recommend buying something from another manufacturer unless you are electronically handyid heard many positive reviews for these radios and figured that plus the astronomical price must mean its got something going for it
wrong
other than the heavy wood cabinet this is a run of the mill table radio
the reception is no better than any other radio including the fm tuner in my cell phone  even with an external antenna
the sound is ok but nothing to rave about
ive had  year old sony table radios that sounded just as good or better
a close look at the componentry reveals this is the same electronic junk that has flooded this country since the american manufacturers threw in the towel
this is a classic case of the placebo effect  it looks cool and the box raves about its superiority so everyone just jumps on the bandwagoni have the tivoli pal and songbook
those are great
the pal battery is not too hot but the sound is great
so i bought the tivoli model one radio
one for my inlaws and one for me
the am reception stinks
the pal am is fine
not the model one radio
would not work well in our kitchen
any other radio was fine
i emailed tivoli and they recommended the am antenna
no luck
that did not help
i live in the seattle area not way out there
so i gave mine away along with the am antenna as it was too annoying
i felt better knowing somebody else may like having it
looks nice
oh the model one fm was ok but not as good as the pal
my father in law uses his occasionally
i should have bought him the songbook or the sangean prdp portable radio real happy with that and it has rds
i would get that instead of a tivoli next time
but the pal is slick but those batteries just dont last
  i had thought the model one would be as good as the pal
oh welli bought one of these since there are no other table radios on amazon and had read other complaints about the overly bassy sound which some characterize as tubby
now that i have it i agree
it is very poor sounding with a pronounced upper bass boost about hz which makes for a muddy sounding music and a tiring voice presentation that cannot be listened to very long
there is no tone control so we are stuck with it
i am surprised that some people think this sounds good
the controls are hard to use
the slippery tapered knobs are very hard to grasp and make tuning a bothersome thing to do and difficult to zero in
it has a cheap feel to it
am reception is ok but not very sharp so that it is hard to separate  wbz from  wins for instance
the fm reception is adequate but seems easily overloaded by nearby fm stations and fails to pick up nearby local college fm stations in the boston area easily
i am disappointed in this and wonder how long it will be that some other company realizes the gap in product offerings in the table radio category
there must be a lot of other older parents who ask for a table radio for christmas
i hate to give such a poor review and fully expect that i will get a lot of not helpfuls but i am in the audio business think i know what i am talking about
and really wanted this simple table radio to do what it shouldthis review is for the previous model the blue routerthis has all the features of a standard router that i need it never has disconnection issues see my additional notes near the end
 never slows me down etctheres an electronic noise emanating from it its a very high pitched squeel
if youre accustomed to various electronic noise produced by small cheap devices that hum eeeee or tick etc then you know what im talking about
doesnt get hot so no worries reallythis thing goes eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  nonstop all the time it never changes
i had to hide this router in a spot where i cant possibly hear it  it wasnt fun rewiring the house to accommodate this thing if i am to get some sleep at nighteditafter  solid years of operation it began to lose the connection to my isp
for a long while i thought it was just routine server maintenance on their end because it would almost always happen right at the stroke of midnight or between midnight and  amtwo nights ago this happened and the problem did not remedy itself as it always had
i tried resetting it both through the web interface and by holding in the reset button on the router itself
the dynamic ip configuration is just dead now and it will never connect no matter how many times i reset it unplug everything etcthe only way i can connect now is to manually enter a static ip address which wont always work with my isp since they assign numbers dynamically
this router is still under warranty and i am waiting for tech support to contact me to tell me what my options areseller says it work well i tried to connect it to my cable modem and setup at home but failed every time
then i tried in my office with static ip address it worksi asked the seller to help the seller said that it works well and asked me to contact my internet provider
my internet provider asked me to contact manufacturer for help
i gave up and got another router linksys it works well with my internet
this router maybe not good enough so i give it two starsi bought the twswca to replace a failed smceztx router since i read the smceztx router is prone to a short life
it arrived quickly and had a quick and easy install via a webbased application
i saved the configuration per the instructions it then recycled the connection and i was online
later on i put the pc in sleep mode and when i woke it up i could not access the internet
i went through the setup again and got online
later i rebooted and had no internet connection
reloaded the router again
opened a tech support ticket and was told to upgrade the firmware from v dated tue jan    to vb dated tue jan   
also i was told to keep the cable modem and twswca powered on all the time
it still loses the setup and has to be reconfigured
trendnet sent me another twswca after telling me to send the original one back to them
the supposedly new one was an older model
i could tell it was an older model because the led color of the online indicator was red instead of green
anyhow it lost its connection too
i bought a netgear router and have had no problems putting the pc in sleep mode and waking it up and being connected every time
the trendnet router is now with my spare parts collection in the basementthere arent too many options for a wired router that is also inexpensive and allows port forwarding so we purchased this one
it worked well for the  computers we hooked it up toand we had fast speeds with it once we set up port forwarding
but it wasnt functioning with our third computer
that computer was receiving no internet connection error and could not access the router configuration in the browser
i tried many things to fix it disable firewall  antivirus switch cables etc but just couldnt get that computer to access our network despite the computer being recognized by the router
this is after i already called our isp to reboot the modem
we purchased a different router last week and hooked it right up no problems
all  computers worked great it had  ports and was less than 
sosadly this router was a failure for us
if only all connections worked fine i would have given it  stars though more than  ports would be betterusing this as a switchtrying to change the default ip address took a couple of attempts
it seemed to have problems saving itthe reset button is wonkydont buy itive been using this router for a couple of years
it gets the job done but its not particularly reliable
even when it was new i usually had to reboot it once a dayit makes a quiet but audible sound that can get very annoying if youre sitting near it
its a weird highpitch sound almost like crickets chirping in the background
most people probably wouldnt notice it if they have a lot of other soundsnoises in their environment or if theyre sitting several feet away from it but if its on your desk and youre in a quiet room you will definitely hear itthe web interface for configuring the settings is easy to use but also a bit flaky at times
some settings are disabled and cannot be changed such as the daylight savings time setting so the time on my router is off by one hour for six months of the year
not a big deal but sort of strange
ive tried to update the firmware but there is no new firmware for my router listed on the trendnet web sitei was looking for a router that was not wireless to replace an aging router that acted as a gateway for my overly complicated home network and bought this one of the few wired only routers i could find
firmware lacks blocking to specific computers or sub nets which i use to secure my network from computer that have been blocked by my firewall attempting to access my network
i was never able to configure my network to allow access computers that were on other routers connected to this one so i put the old one back in place and put this back in the box
you however may live a simpler life and it might work fineim fairly tech savvy but i couldnt get this thing to work on my apple mini
i had to send it backi didnt return this item because something was wrong with it but i found a better deal which was cheaper for the same amount of cds i paid  dollars for this product but i found another item for only  and yes its only a few dollars cheaper but at least your helping a charity in the process that is why i went with the other product cheaper  helping a causeluck of the draw this didnt work for the dvd player i purchased this for even though it listed a lot of devices its compatible with
disappointing but it was cheapi have an sbc executive series phone with a cord that gets constantly tangled
i was hoping this would fix the problem however this product does not fit the phone because the jack is set back further than these can reach to click inwhile an optical mouse can be of real help especially for the mobile user the form factor of this device makes a hard to use
its small size results in a cramped hold and operation thus causing more pain than necessarythe space saved using this mouse as compared to the microsoft optical wheelmouse or the microsoft optical intellimouse is only marginal
yet either one of these alternatives provides the same advantages of optical rather than mechanical cursor control while allow for a much easier handling due to the more appropriate form factor of the latter modelsrather than designating this mouse for notebook users microsoft might be well advised to consider repositioning it as quotoptical kids mousequot since its overall size and handling is quite favorable for younger users with smaller handsi have had good luck with microsoft periferals but this mouse failed meive used it everyday for about six months  ive been a little tough on it but no more than to be expected of a notebook mouse a little tugging repeated plugging winding up to be stored in a case etc
the failure seems to be the cord  probably one of the wires in the cord is fraying
im going to replace it with a wireless mousethis camera has a good price
however for anyone with any desire to tweak settings you should definitely not get this
other mp cameras such as canon a have lots of creative options not found here including adjustable iso speed
this will add visible noise above  but it is possible to get low light shots not thinkable with this camera
also the maximum 
 sec
shutter interval does not help in this respect
as someone mentioned the white balance tends to be off a bit
here are some additional ideas of mine relating to this product and the fact that it only uses xd memorywhich by the way as of this costs twice the price of compactflash or smartmedia and by the time you buy a good amount of memory you will have spent as much as a better canon or something with the same amount of memoryi could not agree more on the issue brought up here
as if there were not already enough memory formats yet another one
it seems to be about either desperate or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever
why cant we just have one or two formats of memory
this is as bad as it would be to have  formats of cdrom drives
and sony is even more guilty than fujiolympus wmemsticksmartmedia was developed by toshibafujiolympus and now fujiolympus couldnt get along with toshibapanasonic for the sd card
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices
we need to standardize the market
we cant afford to buy special memory for each and every device
if you buy fujilympus i sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xd
together the people can control the market for our own goodheres are the positives
its dirt cheap and beats all its competition in price
has x optical zoom
uses inexpensive  easy to find nimh aa batteries
light weight
downloading pics on win xp is very easy you dont need to buy any ac adaptor or card reader
included cable works great
the manual is easy to read and understand
the menus on the camera itself are very easy to use and navigate
nice sharp  well focused daytime picshere are some negatives
too thick to put in any pocket except maybe a big winter coat
uses a propreitary and expensive xd card
this adds to cost and makes tougher to recommend it
lens has very slow startup time and takes long to retract back
i feel its slower than even  poor low light performance
mostly the white balance brightness is wrong have to fiz each picture in photoshop
theres no tv output on this what a shame 
the movies recorded dont have sound and are not so great
cheap and low resolution lcd screen
fuji cut too many features compared to  on this smaller lcd size no nimh batterycharges included slow startup times etc
poor build quality
last yrs  failed due to many things like stuck lens and battery leaked charge
 seems likely to have same troubleswish fuji had made this thinner by about  used a standard compact flash card instead of propreitary xd card had a tv out better white balance and quality control
my  is going back to store
i had rather buy a canon or nikonif you dont mind being stuck with a dead camera on a trip and dont mind above shortcomings its a good buy
overall if you on a tight budget or a first time buyer you can go for this
otherwise look for something worth your time and moneyafter reading all the hot reviews about this speaker system i decided to replace my ar wedge speakersthe speakers arrived yesterday and i hurriedly connected them then fired up my musicmatch
i tried listening to different music and could hardly hear it i cranked up all the volume and was dissapointed with how low the volume was
the base was good but the high range was not sparkling
i hooked back my old speakers and turned down the volume and it sounded far better than these creatures
needless to say they are on their way back to the shipperive bought two of these and both have gone bad
the first one quit working almost immediately and the the second one quit four months ago
we have the same brand of kvm switches the four port model at the community college where im an it student and we have had quite a bit of trouble with them
i would not bother buying another one from this brandi have had  of these and the more i use it with my  thinkpads at work the more troublesome it becomes
i have the laptops attached to port replicators and have tried multiple replicators for both including one brandnew one to plug this kvm into
the problem is i can never tell when this thing is going to decide to hang up my machines
i have had it lock up the os on them xp
linux doesnt matter which is running and i have had it suddenly decide to disable the mouse also have tried multiple mice
the most irritating feature of this kvm is when it decides to hang up the keyboard interface and prevent my machines from booting at all
the only solution at that point is to unplug the keyboard or mouse from the port replicator at which point the machines will start to boot up
of course since youve had to unplug one of them the mouse will not be functional within the os once it boots
so you then have to remove any papers or books you happen to have on the laptop pull ot out of whatever monitor stand you have it under and use the screenkeyboardmouse on the laptop itself
at that point this kvm becomes totally and utterly uselessthe only reason it has gotten  stars is because its quite nice to use when it is working
and its cheap although it seems to embody both connotations of that wordmy previous kvm switch could not deliver enough resolution for my new graphics
the iogear worked perfectly for a month until the number  mouse port died
now the fun begins trying to get it replacedthis product has a major flaw
i bought the iogear based on the reviews here and else where
brought it back
the mouse would not function on the line attached to my ibm laptop docking station
i found a note at the end of the instruction booklet that says it doesnt work with ibm and toshiba laptops
no mention on the package and none in the reviews
bad
ibm and toshiba are huge so this is not a small flaw
i returned it a bought the belkin which works flawlesslyi have a logitech keyboard without a scroll key which is required for switching between cpus
ive tried the automatic scanning mode but it doesnt work either
you would think that there would be some means of changing the hot key on the unit but there is nonewhen i was shopping for this one review caught my eye saying this tripod was mostly metal
that claim along with the light weight in the description were the two things that sold me on the modelwell neither are true
this thing is indeed mostly plastic made to look like black metal
apparently this fooled the other reviewer but not me
the only metal i found on the whole thing were the bars of the legs themselves and the bar of the swivel handle
every single other part of this thing is black plastic
all of the hinges and joints are plastic
the leg braces are plastic
the height crank is plastic yikes
even the center tube is plastic
overall it looks nice ill give them that but please know that you are not getting a mostly metal tripod here
no waynow that by itself wouldnt be too bad except that youd expect something thats nearly all plastic to be much lighter  it isnt
the part of the description that readsproduct dimensions  x  x  inches   poundsis wrong
maybe this thing weighs  pound on the moon but its much heavier where ill be using it here on earth
it is indeed much closer to its described shipping weightshipping weight  poundswhy the large discrepancy
who know
sloppiness on amazons part i guess
at any rate the weight was key for me and there were several tripods lighter than  lbs which i passed up
i guess i should have trusted my instincts when they told me this was too good to be trueanyway if im going to buy a plastic tripod i want it to be much lighter than  lbsreceived the tripod yesterday purchased based on positive reviews on amazon very disappointed
the tripod is  plastic
all the controls are plastic how long will this last is debatable
the weight should have been a clue
lesson learned see it in person first
would not buy againthe webpage and reviews indicated that this tripod was acceptable for video use
it is not
the pan and tilt action is erratic jumpy and unpredictable making it useless for any kind of camera motion
i should have known this based on its price but wanted to give my daughter a simple tripod for her video shoots
mistake
by way of contrast the sony vctorav is a fine inexpensive tripod  head for entry level video work
the r would be fine for still shoots
ill add that i know a bit about this as im a career cinematographer who owns or uses on a regular basis tripod heads costing s of times more than this unitim really disappointed in this radio
the shortwave sensitivity is so poor that most of the time the radio is useless as a shortwave reciever
ive used previous sony receivers similar to this one that were excellent receivers but this one didnt follow in their tracks
if all you want is an fm receiver that part seems to work really welli really wish this radio worked as i did hours of research but unfortunately i could not recieve any shortwave no matter what i triedi even tried an outside antenna with absolutely no receptioni returned it but was really sorry to do soi may buy another hope its bettermuch too complicated to use
a person needs to be an electronics wizard to figure this thing out
should have bought a less expensive world short wave radio as this one is way too complicated for me to use
unless you are really adapt to these things go for one more easy to use and understand
sorry i bought such a monsterthe size is right its about the size of a paperback
i mainly listen to am  fm band radio and the reception on this little radio is awful
its astounding it costs so much is from a company with a good reputation and yet performs so poorly
if youre addicted to all those nonam  nonfm frequencies okay this radio is probably mediocre bad reception but inexpensive for what you get
when one considers the actual performance of the device it really disappointsif i were stranded on a desert island gilliganstyle id want one of these but here in the big city there are cheaper and better alternativesafter a great deal of research and time i decided to choose this radio over the grundig g
in most cases the reviews indicated that the sony was a much better radio for reception quality and its synchrounous detectioni wanted a small portable that has sychronous detection capability
i currently own an eton e an eton e and a grundig g
out of the box the sychronous detection on the sony did not work
this is most likely a defective radio but i have other complaints as well hence i took a refund instead of an exchangeprosbuild appears to be very ruggedthe radio has a nice professional look glossy silvergenerous package that includes a sw station book comprehensive user manual and an external antenna but no ac adapterconsthe synchronous detection feature did not work
you could hear it kick in but it did not improve the reception of the stations at allthe synchronous detector switch along with the ssb usblsb switches are on the side of the unit and difficult to maneuver without turning the radio sideways to look straight at them
the black labeling over black siding makes them even more difficult to see
the small switches may prove to have a short life over time speculation onlyreception was not quite as good when comparing it to my eton e side by side as i had expected especially since the vast majority of the reviews that i have read said that the sony was far superior to the eton e for reception on all bands except fm
the e was slightly better than the sony on all of the mw and sw stations that i tested them onthe reception improves with the sony anlp active antenna but they are hard to find get them from japan via ebay as they have been discontinuedthe external antenna jack is not intended for use with any radios other than a few select sony radios because it supplies a dc voltage to power the sony antennas so it makes it difficult to use other antennas unless you clip them to the whip and forgo use of the external antenna jackcannot label the presets with anything other than numbers no alphanumeric capabilitythe buttons are not backlit and the display backlighting is not very brightno signalstrength meterthis radio does not live up to the hype
the synchronous detector was the gamebreaker for me especially considering all of the hype about how good it is
the sychronous detection on my eton exm is fabulous and it is pretty good on later builds of the grundig g so it can be done wella number of years ago i owned a sony  short wave portable
because of its complexity i didnt like it
most of my short wave listening swl is done late at night in the dark without waking my wife
so a radio which requires a lot of fiddling around doesnt suitrecently i began searching for a less expensive and smaller portable instead of using my ham radio transceivers for this purpose
a study of the amazon reviews and others convinced me that the three best radios out there are the sangean x the sony gr and the tecsun  i ordered all three from amazon and compared them side by side for a week
i made no attempt to grade all the bells and whistles but instead only evaluated a few central characteristics including build quality tuning ease fm music quality and shortwave and ham band sensitivity
the results were quite surprising
as a check i used my two ham transceivers icom mkiig  kenwood th fa to comparethe sony gr has a very high build quality and has reasonable audio for fm music listening
in addition it was very slightly better than the runnerup tecsun for its main function for me sw and ham band listening
however the radio has several fatal design flaws
the primary one is its awkward almost infuriating tuning method when youre sweeping through a sw or ham band looking for stations updown buttons which create about a halfsecond silent pause each time you change the frequency
a  second issue is the tiny weak display screen compared to the sangean the display screen looks positively archaic
a  minor consideration is that the antenna mount is quite flimsy allowing the antenna of this brand new radio to wobble around like its worn out
finally the thumb wheels on the side of the radio are awkward to use
in comparison with this the sangean is a much better piece of equipment except that its ability to pull in short wave and ham stations is amazingly weak
in this side by side comparison the tecsun  was the clear leader by far the best tuning mechanism very adequate sw and ham band sensitivity knobs that project out of the side and are exceptionally easy to use the smallest size and weight of the three compared here and the cheapestby far
i happily sent the sony and the sangean back to amazon and received an immediate refundafter reading reviews and trying to balance everything i finally got around to making myself order this radio
my intent was to replace my sangean  ats which has been showing signs of not being as sensitive to dx and swssb stations
after trying with the included antenna and several add on antennas i was disappointed to find that this radio was less useful in listening to swssb than the sangean which has lots of hours on it
when i could pick up swssb stations the fine tuning never really let me center it so that i could listen to the hams talk about their antennas and their dogs
i suppose the fm and mw were ok although i didnt spend much time trying them my goal was to buy a good hot portable sw  this one isnt itperhaps the luck of the draw with some little discreet component or the factory adjustment as it left the shop
who knowsbesides that there is no ac power pack and you will be finding one to pay for extra
the controls are strange badly laid out and for some things require both hands on the radio to accomplish
tiny little switches you cannot see without good light on the end almost guarantee your other fingers will hit the  button on the front
more controls on the left endmore controls on the front many with at least two functions per button
and the slight but noticeable delay between pushing the up or down frequency button and when it really locks on and you get sound againhad this radio been really sensitive and really pulled in the distant stations or really done a great job on swssb i would have forced myself to deal with the controls
so i sent it back
amazon was great and took it with my description of the problems
perhaps they have taken some back before
sonyare you listeningthe receiver arrived without visible damage
when i connected it to the same antenna i use for my sony icf i heard no signals from about  to about  kilohertz
stations i could hear on my s built in antenna could not be heard on the  using its built in antenna
i returned it for a refundi bought the sony icf swgr for two reasons one because for years its been popular among radio enthusiasts dxers and swlers and two because it probably will not be available for much longer
this is the only shortwave radio sony presently makes and it may be the last the company will ever make
i wanted to see what all the hype was about while there was still timethe unit is impressive in its build quality
the body is solid and weighty and the buttons and switches seem firm and reliable
however the antenna flops from side to side which is ridiculous in a radio that has been around for so long
why would sony not have fixed such an obvious flaw over the yearsam and shortwave reception off the whip are good while fm is only fair
there are a number of features for better tuning in frequencies such as synchronous detection gain and a filter switch
the sync is an interesting feature and can substantially improve the problems of drift and distortion
the key is to try both usb and lsb positions to see which sounds and works bestmy main complaints about this radio are the display window the tuning and especially the audio
the window is small poorly lit with an olive green light and provides minimal information
the absense of a tuning wheel of any type makes skimming through the frequencies inconvenient
instead you have to hold down buttons press them repeatedly or else let the scanner cover each meter band one segment at a time
when the scanner reaches the top of the segment it then returns to the bottom
in order to get beyond one segment to the next you have to hold down not the course tune button but the fine tune button
and of course you also have to know the exact frequency the scanner needs to pass in order to reach the next segment
this is a total pain in the neck and it repeatedly sends me to one of my other sw radios
a tuning wheel would have instantly solved the problem
but my main issue is with the audio quality  thin cheap and tinny like an old transistor radio
the sony sounds worse than any radio ive ever owned
because i keep a radio at my desk and may listen to it for several hours per day this is a very annoying flaw to me
the tone is much better through a set of headphones  especially on the fm band  but who can stand listening to shortwave for hours through headphones
a pair of quality computer speakers would solve the problem but as it is this radio is not for those who listen to radio for hours on end and especially not for music lovers
even fm sounds poor through the speaker
in my opinion sonys own  icfsmk pocket radio has better audio quality
this is unacceptable for a radio that costs  or more and gets rave reviews
its also a reminder to take user reviews with a grain of saltthe sony excels as a portable shortwave radio with ssb
this is definitely its strength and as such it is worth having especially if youll use the included wire antenna that substantially improves the reception
it also comes with a shortwave manual that offers helpful information including frequency locations
clearly the icfgr was designed for the shortwave hobbiest and the whole package makes a nice little shortwave kit  radio with tilting stand on the back soft case reel antenna and two booklets
but beware that the unit does not include a power adapter
its batteries or nothing unless you can find an adapter elsewherei placed the sony icfgr next to my favorite sangean ats x radio and compared performances
regarding sensitivity without the reel antenna i found the two to be approximately equal
the sangean actually surpassed the sony on fm sensitivity and am selectivity
i was quite disappointed with its selectivity especially since a local station that i listen to constantly gets terrible interference from another signal whereas the sangean picks it up with no interference at all
and of course the sangean has far superior audio quality and in my opinion a far more sensible and attractive design including a tuning wheel
then again the x costs a whopping 
yet the sony beats the sangean whenever the synchronous detection is applicable
that is a very useful feature that alone makes the sony a respectable amsw radio
i add these comments because the two models have been perhaps the most popular portable multiband radios over the years so comparing them is only natural
if you could afford only two portable shortwave radios or wanted to limit yourself to only two i would say these are definitely the two to havein the end the primary description of this radio that comes to mind is mediocre
sorry icfgr enthusiasts but this radio has serious flaws
it is a multifeature multiband unit decent enough for swling but unfortunately having a floppy antenna poor display window moderate selectivity no tuning wheel and terrible audio quality
in addition the controls on the sides of the radio are tiny and poorly labeled so that people with either bad eyesight or fat fingers could have a difficult time using them
i would not have purchased it except for its reputation which is to say i had expected a substantially better radiothe sonys outstanding feature is its synchronous detection which really does work wonders
it allows the radio to latch on to some frequencies that otherwise would be intolerable due to interference
but the several serious shortcomings of the sony make me give it only a twostar rating
note the price of this radio meanders all over the place from between  to close to 
if youre going to buy it then at the very least wait a while until the price nears the lower rangei suspect it is a fine product that lives up to the sony name but it is too complicated for the average person
i suspected this when i bought it and quickly learned that i was in over my head
i think this is for the more serious useri used to be a toshiba fanatic but this is the third disappointing toshiba product ive purchased over the past  years
im not buying any moreoverall this is a good dvd player
it plays dvds dvdr cdr cdrw jpeg pictures and mp
however it will not play mps from cdrw and there is no  i repeat no  random playback feature for mps
imagine that folks
oh also you can only put  mps or jpegs on a disk the player simply wont recognize more than thatso with  disc slots thats about  songs you can put into this player at once on mp but you cannot play them back in random order
this quite literally defeats the entire purpose of having mps to begin with
dont even bother converting anything to mp because youll never listen to more than a few hours at once which means that youll never hear most of your songs unless you manually start playback at random placesthis is simply wrongthe remote is typical toshiba fare which means it looks as if it were designed and built in north koreaconnectivity is good
optical digital audio out digital coax out component video out and svideo out are all presentif you never plan to play mps and you have the fingers of an yearold child and dont mind the remote then this is a very good dvd player
if you have normal fingers and play mps dont even think about it
what a disappointmenttoshiba did a decent job of providing a good dac for their video and digital audio options for excellent sound
however it lacks the intelligence that i think should be standard for a device like this
for instance it does not seem to have continuous play or at least i cant find a way to enable it
when playing cds it stops after each disc and you have to manually tell it to play the next one
duh
so you press the quotskip discquot button on the remote and it goes to the next disc somewhat slowly and then stops again
duh
you then have to press play to get it to go
repeat the above after each cd
its smart enough to know that its a cd and not a dvd but not smart enough to know that you want it to keep going
the only way i could find around this is to do a program play and specify each disc
this is a pain to do every time i want to just dump  cds in press play and have music for  hours
my current cd changer which is  years old can do this why cant the sdfrom what i can tell after running it through the ringer for three days it plays dvds quite well
however the purpose of this machine is to be multifunction device and be able to be a cd changer which imo it fails at
why else would you have the capability to hold  discs and be able to play cds and mpsafter doing much research on this monitor i thought it would be a great buy
its supposedly the new version of the nec sb that was discontinued and has been highly praised by many in several pc hardware forums i visit
well something must be wrongim now on my second mitsubishi sb and the same problem occurs as it did on the first blurry text
running at the recommended resolution of x hz text is very blurry in the center of the display
its even worse near the center bottom of the screen
however both the left and right edges of the screen stay sharp at that resolution
the first one i bought was worse than the second one and necmitsubishi tech support told me it was defective and to get it replaced
my thoughts are that it could be a bad batch of these as both were manufactured in november of  i had a  sony e prior to this monitor and it didnt have this problem
and im using a ati radeon  pro video card so i know this isnt the problemother problems with this monitor are bad geometry and bad convergence
the center part of the screen looks fatter compared to the edges which may be the reason for the blurry text
images look out of proportion and not very sharp if viewing them at the center of the screen
as a web designer working with graphics this poses a problem for me
i actually run this monitor at x for the proper  aspect ratio but it still looks fat in the center of the screen
the sony i had didnt have this problem and imo is a much better monitorthis monitor does have good color saturation and contrast and is great for gaming and watching dvds on
but for a  monitor at this price i expected much better results as running at a lower resolution x hz just to get clear text defeats the purpose of using it
and having to lower the refresh rate to hz at higher resolutions to get clear text is ridiculousnot to mention hard on the eyesthe bottom line is that the necmitsubishi sb does not live up the recommended specs and should be avoidedthis camera is a good price for a very basic camera
however there is one issue i would like to bring up regarding the fact that it is limited to xd memory
as if there were not already enough memory formats yet another one
it seems to be about either desperate or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever
why cant we just have one or two formats of memory
this is as bad as it would be to have  formats of cdrom drives
and sony is even more guilty than fujiolympussmartmedia was developed by toshibafujiolympus and now fujiolympus couldnt get along with toshibapanasonic for the sd card
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices
we need to standardize the market
we cant afford to buy special memory for each and every device
besides the memory costs so much more now two x that by the time you buy alot of memory you could have bought a better canon or nikon or something with the same level of memory for about the same
if you buy fujilympus i sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xd
together the people can control the market for our own goodi spent a lot of time recently backing up digital photos on cds and got frustrated enough with this brand that i feel the need to warn folks about it
they seem to produce a large number of duds that wont playopen after you burn them
some wont even burn in the first place others will pretend to have burned just fine but wont open with any drive ive tried
make sure you test your backup cds to verify that your computer can read them before erasing the data from your computer
from the package i had bought i ended up throwing away  of the cds after burning and finding out they didnt work
had i not tested them before deleting files i would have lost a lot of photos i thought i had just backed up
bought another brand hp and went through almost  cds so far and have not had to throw a single one away yeti bought a cd spindle last year  out of the  at least  have so far been bad cds  i mainly bought this made in india version because i just got tired of the made in china cheap stuff  i thought perhaps indian quality may be better  but it was notthey are cheap  i think mine came to less than  per cd  but you have to double check each cd after you burn them to make sure it can play backi know i am as guilty as everyone else for buying the cheaper ones and driving our manufacturers out of us and into third world countries where quality assurance is just not high on their agenda ive purchased memorex cds by mail through this site several times and will continue to do so since they dont go on sale very often in my area anymore
twice so far the cd cake boxes were broken upon receipt
in the first instance the cds themselves were fine
in my march th purchase the cake box was damaged enough that i had to transfer the cds to a different cake box and found that several cdsfive so far of the hundredwere scratched and unusable
the cds themselves are reliable when not damaged and they are shipped quickly but definitely need to be packaged more securelyupdate  of the  cds were scratched or otherwise marked
i looked into asking for a partial refund but found it is either all or nothing so i am out of luck
i had to use the cds that were unmarkedi purchased them for archival reasons and needed them when i purchased them
i guess if you can buy your cds in personi too have bought hundreds of memorex blank cds and dvds
always been happy up to now
with the changed packaging comes a change in the disc quality
they are thinner cheaper looking and for some reason the spindle i got smelled awful
i know that sounds like a bad western but thats the way it is
after years with memorex ill be trying other brandsi bought this wireless phone jack system to replace another one from ge that didnt work at all the latter being designed for extension telephones but not modems for connecting my dish network satellite receiver to a phone linethephonex px wireless jack system for modemsappears to capture most caller ids and ive been able to download help files from dish to the receiver via phone but i have yet to be able to make an outgoing connection from the receivermy phone line isnt the cleanest in the world ive had att out several times to resolve my phone line issues but alas but thephonex px wireless jack system for modemsdoesnt appear to be very reliable in noisy environments
as a matter of fact a phone connected to the extension jack will pick up even more noisegiven the wide disparity in ratings from other reviewers perhaps the product has quality problems some work some dont  mines not solidit barely works and initial setup was troublesome as the  boxes didnt want to talk to each other i finally figured out that the range on this thing is pretty poor worst then on the rca rc which i finally ended up switching toi bought this unit for my home office because my phone jack was too far away from my allinone with fax and i didnt want to run a long cord from one end of the room to the other
set up was very easy it took only  minutes
i have a cordless phone hooked to the base unit and the reception is crystal clear
i dont know how well this unit would work if the base and extensions are in different rooms but considering the size of the room theyre in and all of the electronic equipment in it i am very pleased with the clarityedit  worked perfectlyfor less than  months
both the base and extension dont recognize that theyre plugged into an outlet
i cant send or receive any faxeshaving a tough time finding a strap for my canon sx hs
this neck padding is stiff rough and rides high on my neck though the straps do insert easily into the recessed camera bracketsoptech customer service is exemplary though and after the fourth call to them ive discovered that the pro strap has the same fastener strap as this one and the pro is super comfortable
just dont order the pro loop strap the loop diameter is too thick for insertion on the canonjust got these earbuds
the sound is not richit is tinny and thin
they occasionally crackleive only been using these for ten minutes but i doubt i will change my mindnice sound very happy with them the first weeks but  months later one side left died
ill see for the  day warranty if panasonic makes the change
buy them for travel or for the kids not as your permanent earphones
not recommendedthese headphones have poor sound quality
although for the price i cant really say im surprised
i just dont understand how these headphones have so many good reviews with people talking about how great the sound that comes out of them are
they also feel flimsy and cheap
heck these headphones are so bad they make my zunes stock headphones seem like premium headphones
if youre looking at these headphones i would suggest you buy something else
i cant even believe that theyre selling for about  now
i bought them for  a few months ago and i still regret buying themi dont know why anyone rated this anything higher than  stars
i buy things on amazon based on its extremely high rating among its users and buyers and i was really excited
however the audio quality of these earphones are seriously bad
not hissing and popping bad  no bass and artificial sounding badi dont know
if you dont care about bass in your music i suppose these will work
im sorely disappointed because my ipod earphones must have spoiled me
i cant believe something that came with my ipod works miracles compare to these thingsperhaps im biased because i also have owned a bose system with two tweeters and a very profound subwoofer effect from a very large woofer
what doesnt help in the tivoli system is that the tivoli speakers in general have exaggerated bass response to them
they are very boomy little speaker enclosures
so when i hooked up the auxiliary subwoofer to my tivoli satellite stereo set i wasnt sure it was even working
turning the bass knob up to the max adds little to the overall effect other than a boom when you turn the set off and on
they recommend that the subwoofer be placed on the floor but even that doesnt add much
to be fair my choice of music is classical so im sure that inagaddadavida might be more impressive with this subwoofer
for what i listen to one would be very hard pressed to tell blindfolded if the subwoofer was on or off
theres already too much woof in the tivoli system to merit spending another  to add an imperceptible amount of woof at your feeti purchased the subwoofer when it still was  and not  when the price was doubled earlier this year
i had to return my st unit due to the fact that it would not automatically shut off when the radio was turned off
tivoli audio replaced the unit and it works fine
it really enhances the sound of the model two especially when connected to my ipod
howeverimho it is not worth the current price
sorry tivoli but doubling the price was not a good ideaill admit im a tivo enthusiastive been lured by some of the features that replaytv boasts program sharing commercial skip
however look closely at the daytoday features and the user interface and youll soon see that tivo comes out on top of replay ultimatetvbankrupt and other knockoffslook for features like quotseason passesquot finds your shows regardless of time and records all of them or first run only
look to see if your box can prioritize your season passes what if shows conflict which one do you really want to record
look to see if your box allows you to save recorded shows for certain amounts of time or save until you chose to delete a feature distinctly lacking on ultimatetv it just woul fifo delete items
commercial skip
forget ittriple speed forward gets you through a commercial break in about  seconds
its the quot second backquot button found only on tivo that is ultimately cool
miss a joke or a mumbled line or wanna see a quick replayhit the second back button once or twice and see it over and overohtivo actually does have a commercial skip they just dont brag bout it second forward button can be set on the remotelast but not least replay has always been flirting with bankruptcy
i live in mt view home of replay and have watched their building gradually go towards empty
ultimatetv has already quotpulled the plugquot and moved the group back up to redmond
tivo is backed by phillips sony panasonic and othersthink twicelook closely at the user interface and the day to day features and youll probably pick the cheaper more useful tivo boxi read so many reviews about cyberhome and thought ill jump on the deal but im not impressed at all
seems it doesnt read the disc too well or makes my dvds skip alot
i watch my movies on the sony dvd player and its fine
also the disc tray is a bit slow on openingim gonna jump in on the norcent dpv and see how that goesi bought cyberhome chdvd  progressivescan dvd player
it is good dvd player for 
this model does not play dvd  r you can not burn mp songs or video or jpegs in to dvd  r and play in this player
the buttons on the player have to be pressed hard to functionit is just oki had the original battery in  motorola walkies for about  years
eventually they wouldnt make it through the day and so i bought this replacement
in  of the walkies it behaves at about  of the original set
the second walkie gives me about  of the original battery life
my kids take our walkies to neighbor houses and we keep the other one to keep tabs on them
they used to go  days of standby with very little talk time these new batteries wont make it  hours
not great dont recommend this onei dont give many bad reviews but i will in this case
i bought two of these batteries at the same time
one went south in about one month
the other lastest about  months
i dont know if they were old stock or motoroal knock offs
i would not buy them again
two stars is generous for this batteryi found this adapter through a search for mac procompatible ethernet cards the listing claims mac compatibility but when the item arrived its pci interface wouldnt work with my mac pro at all
its probably a fine card but it just physically wont fit my systemi purchased the card one month ago
first of all the card received is different from the picture
it is thinner than the picture and doesnt have the write protector
worst of all my camera can not detect the card after  days use
i tried with another camera and two pdas
none of them can detect the card
i contacted the ventor and requested a refund for the purchase
i finally got the refund but the shipping was deducted
i am not sure what the logic is here
am i responsible for receiving the defective product
i wont bother to argue with them for the shipping charge but there is one thing for sure
i will never buy anything from simpletech again
i should give them one star rating but consider their promptness in replying email i give them  stars ratingi thought this would fit my  ipaq but doesnt
i was mislead by the description
havent used itthese are comfortable but the sound is awful
it has no bass whatsoever
the treble is ok but hz isnt a whole lot of treble power either
the sound would be described as inferior no bass no treble all mids
id get the mdrj maybe they dont fit as good but they have a whole lot better sound they have good bass  good treble
these dontfirst of all the delivered product was dark colored and didnt look anything like the pictured redwhite earphones
they sounded great but didnt fit at all
the hooks extended way over the top of my ears and i just couldnt make them fit
gave them to my daughter and she had no luck eitherthese headphones are kind of chintzy but they work okay
they are basically cheap earbuds with a thin metal loop soldered too the back to go around the ear
the sony sport headphones provide much better sound quality and comfort these dont seem to fit as snugly
however the sony sport headphones the one with the plastic loop that goes around your ear ive owned have never lasted for more than  monthshopefully these last longeri think these headphones produce excellent sound
if you are not moving around too much when you use them then i think they are a good choice
however if you are buying these for workouts i think it would be wise to look elsewhere
the bud portion of this product is large and heavy compared to the clip so it winds up resting way outside the ear canal and will pretty easily fall out of place
i find myself needing to constantly adjust them while running or at the gymbought these because the ipod earphones would slip out of my ear while riding
these are very tinny in sound
very little bass lots of screeching
i am back looking at reviews again for a new pair and using the ipod ones againthey work well enough just sitting at my desk at work
the clips will hold them over your ears just fine but they sound rather weak if they arent in your ears
they seem too big and keep coming out of my ears when i runrollerbladeedit after seeing a couple comments after mineill agree they do not fall off my ears because of the clip which is why i originally thought theyd be good for running
the problem i have is with the actual bud coming out so they are closer to just hanging over my ears
there is a big difference in volumesound quality when they are pushed tight in my ears compared to what i would consider falling out
when they are not pressed in tight i have to turn the volume up and they sound more muffledive been using these headphones for a few months at the gympros they are sturdy and wellmade sweat does not seem to bother themcons they dont fit well in my ears
i dont have a problem with most earbuds so this is unusual
the buds are large and the earpieces dont give much support on me  they fall out easily the earpieces are not adjustable the sound is just not good when theyre not in your ear canal
no bass at all and the other frequencies are muddysummaryi would not recommend these for those looking for good sound
i would also not recommend these for people doing vigorous activity where theyre likely to fall outperhaps my ears are small on the inside or something but these headphones will not stay in them
im constantly pressing on them to stay in but no good
ive had them for about  days now and will be looking for different onesthey look neat sound fair and tangle quite easily
despite their appearance they really are not well designed for active people
while running sweat somehow manages to run down the plastic clips and quotfloodquot the ear buds
it did not long before they started to sound weak and lose bass response
finally my right side blew even though my mp player has a pretty mild sound outputi got a few months of use out of them and am debating getting a new pair
i dont like the idea of disposable hardware i expected much better from sonyi purchased this item on  and it never fit comfortably in the left ear but they were about twelve bucks so i did not send them back
well on  the left earphone stopped working
they were not mishandled or torn
there was no indication there was a problem with them
the sound was good and all of a sudden it stopped working
i am disappointed because sony is usually a reliable product
i did not purchase a warranty and i guess i am literally paying the price for not doing sovery difficult to adjust to eye width
low light performance is very poor
i expected more from bushnell
zoom is very difficult to usethe threads only go in a couple of turns on both of the bushnell binoculars i own the bushnell perma focus x wide angle binocular and the bushnell powerview x super highpowered surveillance binoculars
this leave a lot of wiggle room for the binoculars to pivot from side to side
i suppose you could put some sort of a spacer or several washers in between so you could keep the connection tightholy crap is it overpriced
good god why did i buy this
sound qaulity is the same as any other  foot cord you can findmonster means nothing just you pay more for their name thats it
go buy a nonbranded cord off of ebay pleaseso i am out looking for a pda for our budding high schooler
lo and behold here is one that appears to worth our effort and money
palms pda latest has the lowest price for new pdas on the market
we grabbed one and after we paid for it of course took it home for intense trialsthe zire has a white plastic design frame which i find unappealing
thinking of all of the coke spillage or ketchup stains that a typical teenage has on a daily basis
the protective cover is aggravating to say the least
poorly made attached and designed
it flips around or slides off to the side and accidentally activates the zire while in storage
with semi standard dimensions  by  by  inches and  ounces the zire is no smaller than other palms
but it does have a lighter weight since they managed to leave out all of the good stufflets talk big brother  little brother manufacturing
todays market and research communities are striving for smaller lighter faster flashier and less power hungry products
the differences between the zire and its palm siblings are atrocious at bestthe to do calculator and note keys have been removed while the contacts and calendar buttons have been slid flush against the scroll controls
this appears to offer an easier operation especially if trying to operate the zire one handed
there is a customizable favorites button that can be reassigned as can all controls through the preferences menu to allow one to restore a missing buttonsince the zire is equipped with a mhz processor and only mb of ram do not anticipate any blinding speed for performance
trying to run any applications or even play a game bogs the zire down
i have seen snails run faster you know like a commodore vic
as compared to some of its competitors the zire is half as fast as other palms and one sixth the speed of sonys clie line up
the touch screen is easy enough to use but so is my vcrwith the lack in performance one would think other features would rise and out shine the failure
but nooooooooo
the  inch screen is monochrome without back lighting
the screen operates nearly as slow as the processor
visible streaking and blurring as objects move across the display are for kids toys not pdas
at least it is as sharp as those of other monochrome palm models and the resolution has not dropped below x pixels
palm has all ways used a high level of contrast with their screens
this makes the screen easy to read even in dim light
but you still need light more than four candlesthere is a good aspect of the lack luster screen
since there are no backlight or colors to display or drain the battery the battery lasts much longer
the battery lasted over  hours before we put in on chargethe zire comes with palm os and the software cd includes the latest versions of palm desktop for the pc and the mac
windows users also get chapura pocket mirror for interfacing with outlook
but do not look for the documents to go feature
this has been eliminated so you can no longer view and edit word and excel documents much less exchange them between pda and your pc
there are four games included but dont expect to get addicted to them lame was the term my daughter usedthe one positive push palm has with the zire is getting rid of a proprietary data connector
the zire uses the increasingly popular usb cable and eliminates the need of a cradle
no more cradle or wires to haul around or loose
the usb connection recharges the zires batteries
an ac adapter is included for those moments one is not near a computeri ordered this and then cancelled my order after i played with it in the store
it has a very small screen and is hard to read
the color is also white which i thought was pretty tacky
i ended up getting the sony clie and i love it much betterthe zire may be cheap but not nearly cheap enough
its not even as good a value as the old m
zires disadvantages no backlight  mb vs  mb thats the big one and in case you didnt know it really makes a difference unit is disposable when rechargeable battery wears out vs indefinite useful life wreplaceable aaas and you could always use rechargeables in m if you wanted to less bundled software rubbery gel flipflop cover try sliding that easily in and out of your pocket  and soft cover means buttons can get pressed accidentally missing app buttons some games and other apps use all 
 weaker peripheral support eg i could get a keyboard for the m
against all that weigh these advantages attractive styling standard miniusb cable so easily replaced  a nice touch a slightly better screen according to some  but only in good lighting
 rechargeable battery smalllightweight though the ms not what youd call bulky
unless youre a slave to fashion it doesnt seem close does it
since it seems the m has already been phased out id recommend going for the m
ive occasionally seen this priced below the zire go figure even though it adds to the ms advantages the allimportant sdmmc card slot and universal connector expansion featuresi got one of these as a gift
it is easy to use and works ok but is really low tech compared to the newer pdas
the screen is hard to read in low light and is low resolution
battery life is good howeverif you want a cheap black and white pda at least get a sony with the high resolution screen for another pros
works good for someone who only needs basic functions such as date book expense etc
compatible with mac and pc also can connect to other palm pilots via infrared transfercons
black and white screen
only  mb of memory
this is ok if you only use the basic functions of the unit but if you install other applications it tends to start bogging it down
unreliable battery
the battery lasted quite a while when i first got the unit but after about a year of using it it got to where now the charge only lasts for approx
 hourconclusionthis pda is ok for a beginner or someone who needs basic functions but if you are looking for a hard working pda invest a little more and get a better onezire is old stuff packed in new clothes and i think it is not worth the price for the same price there are better choices outthere such as the sony clie line and handsprings visor deluxe line of product
for about  more you can get a mb pda with color lcd in palms own product line
so skip the zire and get something betterfor the same price you can get a sony clie sl at frys electronics
what you get with the sony clie sl are three times more memory mb vs zires mb believe me you can do so much more with mb memory
especially if you are using avantgo
backlight you must have it at night
very useful memory expandability slot for memory stick as extra storage
a x pixel screen instead of zires x screen
a processor twice as fast
four buttons for better game play zire has only two buttons the wheelthe cons of the sony clie sl arethe lcd is not bright and may be a little hard to read at timesno rechargable option the zire uses rechargable lithium batterythe new zire palm is essentially an updated version of the palm m with the following changes an even smaller
screen
 a new stylish form factor
 a rechargeable battery
 a funky new nameall of the other limitations of the m still exist
the memory is not upgradeable and mb is pathetically small allowing for only the most basic address and scheduling functions
the three palm programs that i consider essential would overwhelm this puppy
they are mapopolis a mapping program from mapopopoliscom with keywordsearchable street maps avantgo an online news service that downloads articles to your palm and vindigo a restaurant movie and city guidethe lack of memory is riduculous especially considering that the m model that this also replaces has  mb and a slightly larger screenbelieve me screen size matters when you are pointing and clicking on a tiny keyboard on your palm
and this has to be the smallest screen yetto me this model is only for those misguided and poor folks who would have bought the nowdiscontinued m model but want a rechargeable battery
there are far better models out there for only a few more bucks
you can still find some of the excellent handspring visor leftover models around for about the same price which feature the large screens and  mb
and sonys clie line of palm os handhelds basically now own the middle of the palm product lineheres a basic palm product guidezirepalm m bottom of the line
designed to suck you in but leave you wanting more
think of this as the chevy chevette of palms
plagued by small screenspalm m the mb version of the m
fine except needs batteries and plagued by small screenpalm  ooh expansion slot that you will probably never use
still plagued by small screenpalm  adds color lithium battery to m
not bad but screen still small low respalm m still the standard for monochrome palms
lightweight with a clear large screen and a classic formfactor that gave the company its name
mb expandable lithiumpolymer battery
tripleacespalm m discontinued color model features horrible washed out color screen
avoidpalm m soon to be discontinued color palm
very good but no palm tungsten tpalm tungsten t the top of the line
finally palm builds a palm that can compete with a pocket pc
too bad they priced it like one too
triple aces design with fabulous ergonomics fantastic highres active screen battery bluetooth and dropdown graffiti padfor competitors check out the new handspring treo models which feature thumbpads and a small form factor some with phones and the sony clie line
the clie models which start at just over a hundred clams have a nice form factor and upperlevel models feature the best highres color screens for generally less than what youd pay for a similar palmbranded model
clies feature memorystick slots and lithium batteries
but ive heard sonys customer service is weak compared to palms easyaspie returns
these things do break from time to time so keep that in mindenjoyi could not agree more on the issue not brought up here regarding xd memory that this camera is limited to
as if there were not already enough memory formats yet another one
it seems to be about either desperate or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever
why cant we just have one or two formats of memory
this is as bad as it would be to have  formats of cdrom drives
and sony is even more guilty than fujiolympussmartmedia was developed by toshibafujiolympus and now fujiolympus couldnt get along with toshibapanasonic for the sd card
memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices
we need to standardize the market
we cant afford to buy special memory for each and every device
if you buy fujilympus i sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xd such as the c drools over it
together the people can control the market for our own goodi purchased  of these for my vtech cordless phones
one stopped holding a charge after  months and the other after  months
i decided that this must be a sign to replace my cordless phone system
so i purchased the panasonic kxtgb dect  plus expandable cordless phone system black  handsets
and by the way these phones use standard nimh aaa rechargeable batteriesmy dog sheds hair less than the brush on this
the pad end  useful to remove fingerprints but it adds more to the lens than was there before
microfiber and air appear to be the way to go
avoidit really isnt for small lenses like on gadgets
they should make that clear
if you have an expensive big lens go for iti received this product prime with fast shipping cleaned my main cameras lens went to clean my girlfriends lens and the little pad started coming off by the third use the pad came completely off so now i have to sorta use it like a swiffer and put the pad on between the pen and screen move it around when i pull the pen away the pad stays on the screen
thanks for the  successful screen cleanings
if i knew itd crap out on me i wouldnt have bought italthough i had high hopes that i could carry this cleaning tool with me during my hikes ive since decided that its almost worthless
the main cleaning tip is too large to reach the oculars of my nikon binoculars nice going nikon
and although i can use it to clean other lenses objectives camera the results are uneven and unimpressive
as a long term nikon user im very disappointed that theyve put their name on a product thats as mediocre as this one
surely theres a better alternative for a compact cleaning kit that i can carry in the field
i certainly wont buy another one of theseperhaps i got a defective one but when i use the brush end on any surface it seems to leave a dark residue
i would assume that there would be just a plain reasonable quality brush in it but it wasnt
ive used better itemsthe first few times i used this it was great but i just pulled it out after about a month of not using it and the spongy pad thing crumbled apart as i tried to use it
when i inspected it with my fingertip it left black smudges on my skin
the brush end is fine i guessthis product works well until it works
unfortunately the felt tip has completely eroded after about  cleanings
and i dont even have that much hard cleaning to do
some of the competing products advertise up to  cleanings for the felt tip
i didnt see that until now when i came back in to review this product
not sure about the veracity of those claims but  cleanings seems very lame even independentlyit sort of works but not very well
it doesnt clean the lens particularly well the moist tip isnt moist or is so minimally moist that i cant detect it
the best thing about it is that it is very compact and easily fits in a camera bag
as a cleaning system its not really worth anything
even for freeafter using just a handful of times the felt pad came off the pen
waste of money
only reason i didnt give it  star is because the brush end still works perhaps because i dont use it because i dont need iti am surprised nikon offers this item
if used very carefully you can use the brush to remove dust  but  dont try to wipe the surface of your glass with this device unless it is brand new as grit can and will get in there and produce fine scratches on the surface of your expensive lens if you are the least bit careless
better to not get your lens dirty in the first place
barring that there is a much better way to properly clean a lens that involves rolling tissue that you can find on the internet that costs nothing and can prevent scratches while removing even severe grimei own this product for almost an year
i use only brush of this pen as it is effective in removing any dust from the lensi stopped using the lens cleaning part because over the period of time whenever i use it on my lens it leaves slight black smudges on the lens element which i have to end up cleaning some wet methodi would not recommend this product to anyonethe bristles of the brush fall out several at a time each time i use it
do not i repeat do not use the brush to clean the image sensor of your camera
you will get loose bristles inside your camerato fit the sony cdxgtup cd player i also purchased i had to extensively file down the inside of the mount to get it to fitfor the price the azden passive mixer is really too expensive
behringer audio mixers offers two different mixers that are amplified that i needed for the same price or less
behringer mixers have so many options for the same price that it makes the azden mixer over rated
i returned the azden mixer
if you dont need any preamps for your mics and want a subcompact package for your camcorder then the azden mixer works okayi used them for my back surround speakers but not for long
they just werent up to the task
they lack clarity and frequency response is rather limited thanks to the  driver
theyre ok if you really cant accomodate anything larger but overall id say theyre a waste of moneybigger than it looks on the picture
bought this to pair with the micca mbxes i also bought on amazon
those sound great this does not
voicessounds sound like theyre coming through a radio sometimes
really not anywhere near as good as all these people are making it out to be on the reviews
promptly returnedthese speakers were shipped by the manufacture or i dont know who
when i got them the inside had been shook lose from rattling around bad packing i suppose
i never got to hook them up so dont know more than this
returned there was no problem doing this so your luck may be better than mind if you would like to try thesei thought these speakers were going to awesome from the great reviews but i was really disappointedthey lack so much bass it was weird
oh well they are going back
nothing works like a sub so thats the next orderi purchased this product with hopes of combining my antenna signal with my analog cable box in order to get local hd channels on a secondary tv without having pay my cable company for another hd box
when i installed the combiner i immediately noticed a degraded signal especially from the cable box
the picture from the cable box signal was especially snowy
i tried several fixes to clean the signal but nothing worked
i removed the combiner and installed a switch and the signal from both sources is much cleaner no snow but now i have to get up walk over to the tv and slide the switch when i want to change from local hd channels to the cable box channels
i did not evaluate the splitting function of this deviceit did not work on my hand radio unless it was leaning up on a wall so i contacted the seller and he sent me a new one same problemgave us a little more range but not worth having to deal with the extra height
i would recommend just sticking with the antenna that comes with the radio or get a mag mount and an adapteri had ordered this product for my handheld cb it arrived in the time specified in my initial order
the product overall wasnt what i expected
when connected to the handheld it has a wiggle to it that makes it notso sturdy
also when i had it connected i had to touch the base of the whip to something that was metal or touch my hand on it to get it to work with anything
once you pull your hand away no frequency what so ever
very disappointed with the result of the product
im not sure if i got a dud or if this is how the actual product worksadds height for longer range but the quality leaves a bit to be desired
it appears that there is a wire held in place by heat shrink but it should be soldered for better connectionthis adapter will work for adapting a bnc antenna to a uhf style connector
the center conductor will transmit audio and the signal will get through
but over time these cheaper connectors will tarnish and audio quality will drop off
good for use on a hand held radio but not for leaving out in the elements for a long period of timeget the better tessco version with a better finish for outdoor usewhen i hooked this mike you to my cobra wx ii stock the mike didnt make much difference  over the original factory mike  i then modified the cobra hg m power mike replacing the two resistors  one of them gets taken out and install a jumper r and replace r with a  watt  ohm resistor  and replace the capacitor c with a uf other wise the stock capacitor  will leave the mike sounding flat be careful about soldering the connections that you dont short out the resistors or the capacitors and be careful about reassembly enjoy i only have to put my mike up to  an its blowin smoke and its loud all ready at that point keep on truckini dont like righting a  star review
i tested it befor i sent it to a kid in africa with a nd radio
am was really poorthis radio was very hard to tune even thou it has  bands
amfm were not too bad but shortwave as nearly impossible tune
also their is no dxlocal switch as mentioned in the ad
i also purchased the coby cxcb which works much better has a digital display and a clock function
the cxcb is about the same price
i had them both as the same time and did a side by side compare and the cxcb won hands down
i would not recommend this radio but would recommend the cxcbtomi guess you get what you pay for
the radio did not pick up many stations and was hard to tune
the station indicator stuck after about  months and the plastic film that showed the stations warpedthe coby cxcb portable radio is an analog multiband radio that can be had for under 
at this price you cant expect much but the question isis it worth spending any money on this radiothe radio itself comes in a nice box and it includes a set of ear buds
the radio would be considered a large coat pocket size radio
the overall feel is a bit better than what you would expect for such an inexpensive radio
instead of thumbwheels you actually have sidemounted knobs to turn which in my opinion are easier to use
the front of the radio contains the speaker the slide rule dial a little tuning light and slide controls to turn the radio on a nice feature and to change the bands
the analog dial features a little indicator that tells you what band you are tuning
unfortunately the dials contrast is low making it difficult to see the numbersthe radio is powered by  aa batteries which should last a long time
it was a tight squeeze to get the batteries in
you also have a port for an adapter but one is not providedthe earphone jack allows mono output through both stereo ear buds
the speaker provides reasonable pocket radio sound at a reasonable volume
sound is much better using headphones and actually is quite pleasantperformancelw  the us doesnt use long wave except for some beacons so i couldnt test thismw am am reception is ok  i was able to tune chicago stations with ease
i was also able to tune strong outofstate stations from many locations including  kw clear channel stations from texas colorado new york and tennessee
selectivity was a bit below norm but ok  strangely if the telescopic rod was extended the radio would whine more and toward  khz it would actually pick up shortwavesw  the coby provides a number of shortwave bands
with the built in whip antenna it did a reasonable job of receiving international broadcasts
its simple single conversion design did results in images and some birdies and didah sounds but they were not too objectionable
i tried the radio with a short  foot wire attached to the whip antenna
this overloaded the radio and i started to hear am broadcasters on the shortwave
selectivity is ok for this type of set
shortwave would only be suitable for the big broadcasters like the bbc and radio china but it did a reasonable job receiving those stationsfm  at my office fm was fair
however my home is only a few miles away from a local fm station
the station at  pretty much obliterated the lower portion of the fm dial
i could get our towns college station at  but not much else until wfmt at   shortening the antenna had no effect
based on this fm would only be acceptable if you were far away from any broadcastersif the fm section worked better the coby would be a nice little radio especially at 
no it is not as good as a  dollar radio but at  it is in the disposable category and it could be used at the beach camping or as a gift to a kid who has expressed an interest in radio
with that said the fm performance was so disappointing that it would be hard to recommend it
a very good alternative is the jwin jxm which can also be had for around for
