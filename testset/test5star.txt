we got this gps for my husband who is an otr over the road trucker
very impressed with the shipping time it arrived a few days earlier than expected  within a week of use however it started freezing up could of just been a glitch in that unit
worked great when it worked
will work great for the normal person as well but does have the trucker option
the big truck routes  tells you when a scale is coming up ect  love the bigger screen the ease of use the ease of putting addresses into memory
nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and thats just my luck
i contacted the seller and within minutes of my email i received a email back with instructions for an exchange
very impressed all the way aroundi am using this with a nook hd
it works as described
the hd picture on my samsung  tv is excellentthis adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box
i had not problem with it at all it is well worth the purchase
i recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your nook videos on your hdtv
i just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor i found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my tv
for me it was just right not too long or too short i was able to place my nook right below the connection on the tv stand it did not fall or anything else it is fine
use your own judgement im too busy watching my movies this product really works great but i found the following items you need to keep in mind you must have your power adapter connected for it to workit plugs in the the bottom
it appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate the plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the nook around much without holding the adapter in place on initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid it works with a ft high quality hdmi cable so you can put the nook across the room with you
not tested with cheap cableswarningi found that my lg smarttv d from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many thingsbad software
this adapter works fine with other hdmi devices i have used like monitors and i am sure other tvsgave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your nook as a streaming server to your tv
nice they made such a devicebought for a spare for my  nook hd and it fit perfectly
very satisfied with the price much less than on the bn sitemy son crewed my hd charger cord so i needed another one this is exactly like the one my son destroyedi lost my bn original cable
i looked around for an new one
i tried  a different cheaper model but it didnt fit my device properly so back to the drawing board
i ordered this one
i am satisfied
it works exactly as expected and fits perfectly
i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapterthis is a great buy compared to a  or more a retail storethis mount is just what i needed
it is strong and sturdy
it folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns
a perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your televisiongreat deal easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy
i mounted a  in tv on it and it works greatfor the price you just cant beat this item
i bought it for a house i was selling so i could hang some tv and it worked great
good quality for the pricei used this for my  samsung
its fitfeel is great
easy installation
appears strong although i personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time
it is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and i would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed
the movement is fluid and easily adjustablei am very pleased with my purchasethis item serves its purpose as well as any other mount
its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion
i am using this to cornermount a  tv and it works perfectly to hide the mount receptacles and cables behind the tv
very easy installation as welli love this mount
this is the th one ive bought and it works great every time
excellent seller and excellent producti am very glad for buying it
it is heavy duty and good quality for the price
it was very easy to installthis holds up my inch sony with ease
make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the x ur mounting to and u wont have any problemu may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out itll be there till the house falls
inch lag screws is the way to go dont be cheap go buy emhow much did u pay for the tvnice quality still works great very happy with this purchase need to add  more words so what can i say its a wall mount that i havent had any problems withi bought this for a  tv for my son
i mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great
i love the angles it can achieve
fees very sturdy and well built
it works perfect for my application
very happy with this purchasei am using this mount for a  inch vizio tv and it has been great
the installation process was quick and easy and we love the variety of angles that you can get from this mount
we have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to
we dont usually move it quite perpendicular but it works to do this
my only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side
it takes quite a bit of force to move the tv from one position to another
its a little hard for my wife to do especially with the tv mounted about ft up on the wall
it may be possible to loosen these pivot points but i have not tried
im a little nervous about making it less stable if i dooverall its a great mount
highly recommendeddidnt think it would work as well as it hasbecause the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected but it hardly deflected from theweight of the tv even extended straight outvery heavy duty construction extends tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another  or  if neededwell constructed wall mount for tv sets up to  inches
the mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets
plenty of extra hardware provided
price was about th of what it would cost on the open market
i recommend it highlythis mount is excellent
it is very well built and sturdy
i used it to mount a  tv and it fit the need perfectly
the price was also very good and much much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store
i would definitely recommendworks great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the big box stores
it is super easy to install yourself too
you just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud oh yea a stud finder toocannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web
all other retailers are overpriced for what you are getting  a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a tv that articulates
this mount is reasonably pricedpros  easy to install helps to have a cordless driver to drill  pilot holes and to drive in  lag screws
you also need to have a stud finder well fabricated mount does everything advertised ie
articulates  you made need to loosen up some nutscons really stretching here since this is a good deal instructions could use some help for the novice diyersinstall tip  it really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the tv mountinstalled a  lbs  inch flat panel lcd vesa mm x mm to this mount
mount works beautifully
i originally had the tv sitting a little high on a stand but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen inherent problem with cheaper lcds  not being directly in front of a lcd screen  this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to tilt down the screen
i would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the marketthis mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price
aworks like a charm
lies flat on the wall when i want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when i need it toothe instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well
this is a great product for an amazing priceeasey to put together and install
used to mount a  led flat screen
instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the tv to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job
well built product for being made in chinawish you could buy american made better luck next timei hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my  year old son because i wasnt going to put the  flat screen on it to find out that it failed
fully extends out  feet
this was worth the moneyvery secure we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside
one of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall
the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall
i am really happy with this purchasei live in a studio condo and i needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room
once you figure out which instructions to use several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs they are pretty thorough
dont be afraid to tighten specific joints and loosen others to get it how you want itoriginally had bought a different one and be careful of this but it didnt didnt have near the amount of swing as this one doesthis is the best mount i have ever found especially for the pricehome depot has a nearly identical mount for this mount comes with every fastener you could need from lags hollow wall anchors spacers to varying lengths of metric fasteners to most if not all tvsthey mount easy and are sturdy i have a  led tv on one without issuei also have    and  tvs on them i have used these to mount every ledlcd tv i or friends have mountedquality was excellent
instructions were clear
it was not clear about a tilt feature but there was enough to level it when i finished
be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical
i was using it for a  inch computer screen so i really need it to be level for reading
everything i needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situationsin the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife we decided to mount ourpanasonic tclx inch p lcd hdtvon the wall above the dresser to save some space
you can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes amirite fellas
my wife wanted a fixed wall mount but i thought the viewing angle required some articulation
in hindsight fixed would have worked too
this unit was highly rated and the price was right
soldthe installation was straightforward and fairly simple
the only point at which i needed some help was in balancing the tv while i attached it to the arm otherwise it was all me
i think it looks great my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital
sorry honey
when we mount thepanasonic viera tcps inch p plasma hdtvin the living room ill definitely use a flat mountyou could spend four times this much on an articulating tv mount but i dont see why you wouldneeded a corner mounted flatscreen
this did the job well easy to install
i had to mount in a metal stud so i used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly
expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitorsamazing how easy it is to move my  around on this mount and able to hang off one stud
nice quality feel to metal it is made ofvery happy it looks great im so happy we got it
holds good it is a lil hard to get it to the wall
other then that its fine i love how we have more room in our room
my husband is so happy i ordered this it only cost us  free shipping and fast very thankful to the selleri have a  hannspree lcd tv
it weighs  lbs
most other reviews said they had a tv smaller than this so i was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold  or so lbs
most of my reservation was because it was the first time ive mounted a tv and worried it would fall within a week
ive had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out extend and angle
i like the fact that i can get a bigger tv and still use this mount as its in my living room
it was not too hard to install
i bought a stud finder because i didnt have one and most everything else i already had to install it
i do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install at least for when putting the tv on
this would be extremely hard by yourself especially if you have a bigger tv
overall very happy with this mountinstalled easy and in no time at all finding the stud was the hardest part for me
articulates well with the  tv on it
i would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next tv mounti have two of these now in different rooms
works well with my samsung tvs  for the size noted abovewe got this one recently and its a great wall mount
the unit is pretty heavy so you will need a helper
it also includes a variety of screws to mount also
our tv documentation stated it was a x pattern
but after putting hte plate over the back seems we didnt need the extra extenders as its x
this is on a samsung   series ledtvthe arm is hard to push and pull but that is more due to being new and stiff
make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten themi initially was scared to mount it what if it falls if i screw up
but its pretty easy
not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud but i also used nails to get the actual edges those basic studfinders are never exact
make sure you do the samenot bad for ishi have purchased  of these wall mounts and they hold my  and  inch flat screens perfectly
i love these and highly recommend themvery good item i am happy wit it and delivery time was excellent
i recomended is a good support for your led tv
it is easy to install and it have extra screws for different sizes tvthis was perfect for my  led monitor i had it up in just a few mins and with no problems
it included a small bubble level and it also came with a  hdmi cable which i was not expectinginstalled easily has a nice long reach
attached a  tv for the grandkids and it works out great
accomodates many different size tvs and was a very good pricefor the pricecant be beat
i have two tvs hanging in the living room
no issues easy to hang
i would recommend to a friendworks great
holds my  inch tv effortlessly
very well built
definitely worth the price
easy to install tv to the mount
has cord clips
tv can be tilted up or down and sideways
extends from the wall  inches
i highly recommend this brandi have a  tv and had no place to put it in my bed room
with this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging
very easy to install came with all hard waregreat mount so many areas of articulation
this was a great gift idea my mother loves it
i have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in
a must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or officethis is perfect for what i needed it for
i can move the screen from side to side if i need to and i dont have the tv sitting on my deskhave not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet  will follow up once mounted in place
great price and quick shippingwe bought this for a  vizio and it worked perfectly
i would buy it again and recommend it
good qualityi used this to hang my  lcd that i bought back in  so its a heavy tv that outweighs my new 
everything seems to be made well it was easy to install myself and the tv has been hanging for  months now from a brick wall at its full reach
i cant imagine paying  for other tv wall mounts as well as this one performsyou cant beat the price and the installation was simple as can be
we installed it in our office and it is perfect
no problems and was completed in a matter of minutestotally love this product
i bought two  one for living room one for bedroom
i decided to try my hand in the bedroom first in case i got frustrated and didnt finish the projective gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag  not so with this product
im impressed
every nut bolt screw washer etc
is clearly packaged individually by size and labeled
the arm also comes assembled  which i disassembled for easier handling the wall plate is attached to the arm with two carriage bolts  easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breezetook me  hours from start gathering my tools to finish hanging the tv  oh and im a  yr old disabled female
i do have a  lot of constructiontool knowledge howeverupdate i have now have purchased  of these for work and home and with the lighter led tvs this is a perfect mount for most sizes  this is a great mount  easy to install  easy to use  easy to expand  easy to mount tvs
i havent found another one that is so useful  even if you dont need it to extend this is still a great mount i guess for the price i was expecting something cheaper but i was quite surprised
it was easy to install and works for what i need it for  it may be over kill for a  inch led lcd tv but i like the way it can be moved aroundthe videosecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home
the value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our hdtvs conveniently to the wall
highly recommend this great quality product
this wall mount will secure any of the hdtvs using the vesa  or vesa  mount pattern
we like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the hdtv with a larger size theres a much better chance we wont need to replace the articulating mountyou can spend a ton of money on one of these or you can buy this one
hung a  inch tv with it with no problemsthis is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price
it has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts
the mounting process cant be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference
just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag boltsit easily managed a  led lcd which weighs lbs and it might take the extra  lbs of a  led lcd if its not pulled too far from the wall
since it can swing out over  id be carefull about going bigger than the lb  tv that i mountedthe only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk very flimsy one was broken in the package and shouldnt be included when simple black wire ties work far betterthe mount i purchased is great
it is designed for tvs  and under
the link here and image are not correct
but i really thought the mount was build well was easy to install and the price was fantastictv has been on wall for a long time
hasnt fallen off
its metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in storesthis is exactly what i needed
it was easy to mount and supports my  inch tv  lbs without any issue
i havent tested the extension brackets but the rest of the device is very solid
i will say that the hinges can be a bit tight and its not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly youll need a few tools
if you plan on swinging your tv around a lot this might not be the best choice but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then
my favorite part is the small base
i didnt have a lot of wall space to mount a tv and this met my needs without eating all my money
keep in mind that youll want at least two people to mount the tv on this device
i attached my tv alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while i inserted the screws
speaking of which ive mounted two tvs on this and the box included screws which fit both in addition to many more
however you may need a few more washersthis tv mount i bought for just  easily outdoes similar ones that cost over 
it comes preassembled is easy to mount on the wall and has clear instructions
it also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall
the joints are a little bit stiff but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldnt be a problem
definetely a great buy at a agreat pricei have purchased this mount twice now  one for my bedroom tv and one for my living room tv
the bedroom tv is a  lcd and the tv in the living room is a  led
surprisingly enough they both weigh  pounds  this mount works very well for both of them
its relatively simple to install  you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it
i will admit that my bedroom tv has been attached not to a wall stud but a juryrigged support brace on a cabinet
its still there and attached after  months
i will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff  it can take a little muscle to move the tv
but i think i prefer that  it certainly doesnt feel flimsy and it stays wherever i put ita tip for wouldbe purchasers make sure your tv supports this mount
you can usually find your compatible vesa patterns in your users manual
or a quick online search perhaps
as i often say  when buying online it pays to do your homeworkvery easy to setup simple instructions has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of tvs with great supportanother gem hidden amoungst the amazon halls
this works well for my led tvs
i used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch
i hung on the sucker and its not coming down
and im lbsquickly shipped to my house and mounted myself
i ordered this for my  inch phillips lcd tv and for the price i paid its a great value
does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do
would recommandvery good materials very lightweight  cheaper than others brands
i have a  lg led tv and it fit at  and im capable of sell my tv buy an  and use the same mount without problemsmade in china but this time  its well made
nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of lcd
it has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want
the value for cost here is big since most of these sale for over  or over  at wm
im pleased with itgreat functionality really incredible price and a snap to install
honestly ridiculously good product  wish they were all so easyquick and easy installation  very solid product
very pleased with this purchasewhen in need of this type mount again i will certainly purchase this brandmodel againgreat price on amazon makes it very easyexcellent buy
we are very pleased with this item
it performs very well
the instructions were clear
it was easy to assemble
it holds a  tv very welli bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work
i went to best buy and they said to purchase this  wall mount they had i snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box came home and found this one to be near similar
needless to say i now have my  in lg flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living roomjust in stall another samsung  led flat screen
outside a  patio deck area what a difference this unit madethe mounting kit was very easy to use
again i did upgraded to  using longer heavier mounting bolts
that was only  more but its worth it in the long run
here in earthquake country you nees that support
your flatscreen tv retracts a few inches off the wall plus it will look sweet from  to  from wall areafor a good wall mount of a smaller tv this is perfect
much cheaper than similar in various stores and actually is more flushcompact than i have seen on others with all the adjustments you could wantonly gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately but itll work to get it on at least
all hardware needed is included i had to use a few adapter pieces on my first tv
getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall both are  screens
i feel confident they will be there until i decide to remove emwall stud mounting required but depending on the stud size you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud
should be enough thoughi use this arm to mount my  inch vizio
im surprised my tv has a x mount thingy
it can tilt left and right up and down
i do wish it swiveled the tv so that it wasnt crooked
when the bolts get loose my tv looks crookedwas a perfect fit for my  flat screen tv
i would recommend this wall mount for that size tvgood wall mount
sturdy and does what it is supposed to do
in fact it even held a larger tv than what it was listed as capable of holding
i believe i mounted a  television with this one
not a flatflat one either
i mounted an older heavy thick onethis was half the price of the tv mounts at costco and perfectly fits a vizio  tv for the spare bedroom
it will work with many different brands so in my book that is great
strong sturdy and robustthis is possibly one of the best mounting kits ive ever purchased
i like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of tv
whether they have a rounded or flat back
mine had a flat back so i didnt need the extra piece but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall
the adjustable arm is nice as it is setup in our bedroom
at night the tv is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk  also making the ability to view the tv while workingthe material is very strong hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didnt even budge
this thing seems as though it will last quite a long time
its already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom ill be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model tvsexactly as describedvery heavy dutylots of parts to make any installation workexcellent valuefits various monitors and tvsi bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house
i love all three of them
all mounts have different tvs on them one is a   and a 
product comes with multiple screw for different tvs
outstanding product for the price
all tvs have been mount for a little over a year
this product is a full motion mount for 
and it is primeawesome price and quality
simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation
if you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one id recommendi mounted this in my rv and it holds a  lcd tv  dvd combo
installation was very easy and the mount works great
i was prepared to pay  times the price for a mount that would work as i wanted
i couldnt be happiergot my tv mounted with this above my pc and its been on the wall for a year now
no problems with it holds the tv well and its study
way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what i got i got a  inch hdtvi really like the action on this mount
i purchased a  monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate
i would purchase againthe tv is still hanging from the wall so thats a good thing
the info for this wall mount says it is good for up to  lbs
our old phillips  flat screen weighs  lbs including the stand and after  weeks the tv and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical  x frame member
the mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand tvs
i had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old phillipsbought this mount for a inch panasonic led tv
the mount may look cheap but i found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price
i strongly recommend it to everyonenanvery solidwe mounted our flat panel in the bedroom
like the tipping feature and love the articulating featurewe checked prices at stores big boxes etc
best price of all including costcoeasy to attach
easy to adjust
very solid and secure
used on a clients  led with built in dvdi have my  inch tv on the wall and it works great
easy to install and came with all the parts
the screws that it comes with for the tv will not fit but you can buy some for  dollarsi love this mount
all the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome
holds a sony in ex just fine even fully extended
even bought another
amikei have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio
it holds a  lcd monitor about lbs
its been up for a week and i dont expect that it will fall down anytime soonmy students and i used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects
now i have a  tv for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen
really stable no wigglingvery strong for any tv but i wish that it was little longer i am very happy with it and very strongly recommendedeasy install
looks great and works great for what we need
purchased for game room took  min
to install and  min
to set tv on
greatworks great for a cheap mount
worked great on a  emerson lcd tv
does everything as advertised
can tighten or loosen joints for easier movementwe needed something to extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick
it went up with no a problems
it worked out very wellwe needed a wall mount for a  tv that was going to be in the screened in porch
this was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount
i cant speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle
its also pretty sleek so it doesnt butt out too much
it arrived quickly and it didnt take the installer long but of course he was a professional
looks greati have mounted a  inch old lcd
easy to install
easy to swivel there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nutsit can not be changed without loosing the nutsi wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it
this does that well
i dont move it often it seems strong and well built
if you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot
the articulation is sketchy
for my uses and the cheap price this was perfecti have purchased a total of  hdtv wall mounts from the videosecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable pricetilt tv mount for stationary tvs up to  inchesarticulating  corner mount for small tvslong arm  corner or high mobility mount for larger tvsall of them are excellent products and very easy to installreceived this item quickly and well packaged but not so well that i was infuriated trying to open iteverything was in perfct order
strong handsome appearance
installation kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios
couldnt possibly be happier with this productthe directions stink
just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be okit is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store
was very pleasedgood quality
must mount on a stud
i mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall adding a  ft x in the metal stud track patched the hole and then put up the mount
holds a  tv without a problemeven added a dvd player to the bottom of the tv and it is still on the wall after about  months
price on this item was great and it was sent with free freightthis item didnt disappoint
its sturdy has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes it works wellthis worked perfect
the universal design would fit  of the tvs as advertised
easy to mount and very durablei have a full  hd flat screen mounted on this
not only does everything look better than strapped to a table but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have
it was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint being a single stud wall mount
the other major point of this mount is how many sized tv or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept
my tv mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid yet adjusts with little effort
this is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the moneyhad a couple of guys put this up for me but they said it was easy to install
i like the fact that i can move it around easily and tilt it anyway i want it to bethis product is user friendly and versatileit is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installationadding bidding could drill and bitit was so easy to install
the instructions were simple and so was the process
i was putting off the project for fear
i should have hung the tv long agoworks great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick
it is my sons room and really works greati am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my sony  internet tv
one nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted tv depending on where you are seatedeasy to install and works great
television moves with ease and always feels secure
doesnt loosen over time like other television mountsthis was for a  inch lcd
easy to install and works great
i am very satisfied with this wall mountim using this with my  tv and i love it
the price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores walmart best buyi found this to be an easy install and very secure
the swivel is smooth and i can orient my television perfectly
it also has plenty of vesa mount patterns so it will hold just about any tvfor such a cheap mount it works well
i installed in in about  minuets and use it to hole a  vizio ledthis was a present for myself my son installed it in about  minutes and i couldnt be happier
i wasnt sure this was for me as it for my bedroom but my husband and i love it
so easy to move the tv no matter where you are in the room
a great buymounting the tv after mounting on wall can be a handful
it would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the tv so you did not have to hold it while putting in  screws
that would make diy one person installation easierwhen we first bought our bedroom tv we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices
this is one of the best prices i have found on mounts
this mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle
it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv
you wont be disappointed with this brandif i need to order another this will be the one
i used this to mount a tv to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so i can watch tv while working on the pc nearly a  degree angle
my tv is only a  and i could see that this would work up to a  or so but if you dont need to turn the tv  degrees you could get by with a larger tvi was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen  lg onto the wall  what happens if it falls off
after looking at mounts at target and best buy that were  would this possibly workfast forward  the mount took about  minutes to install too longer to locate the studs than mount it
the tv is on the wall and works wonderfully
very solid mount and good articulationmy only comments are the cord clips included are very weak
i will be replacing them with black cable ties
also  they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the tv on the articulating mount  i can wiggle my screen tilt by about  since there is only a screw on the bottomoverall i liked the narrow wall mount and the  extension
definitely would recommend for a tv that is easy to install with extra hardware for installing your tv
however my tv had a curved back so i used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the tv
i was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall so i added two  lags under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting bracketsafter installing the swing arm wall mount i grabbed the end of the bracket fully extended
the bracket didnt sag a bit
i concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficientive swung my tv out and exercised the various angles available and found the swing arm not giving a millimeteri fully recommend this wall mount
ive a few other videosecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an inch sharp tv
all are quality productspurchased for my sister to hang her tv on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the  vizio tv she got for christmas and was up securely in no time
i looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price
what can i say it does what it is supposed to do was easy to setup and is of good valuethis was needed to mount a  lcd that weighs  lbs in my bedroom
i looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so i was worried i wouldnt be able to achieve the viewing angles that i needed
so i found this one  went w it based on the high reviews
i could not be more pleased price  if you were to go to the big electronics store bb or the big box monster wm you would pay hundreds
i cant fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not
does it cook dinner for me
why pay  for a mount when you can get this one for   oh by the way have the confidence in  customer reviews averaging  stars at the time of this writing function  this mount is solid
it articulates to the left to the right
it pans it tilts
one small negativethe plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless
i took them off whats in the box  normally i would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case i was so impressed i felt it was worth mentioning
it comes w everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves
it comes w lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud
mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete then it has  different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your tv
it has  washer sets for the mounting plate based on if your tv has a flat or curved back
then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate
then it also has  plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall
last but not least are the vesa adaptors which i did not need what you need that isnt included   pencil  level  stud finder  phillips screwdriver  drill w a  drill bit  socket wrench w a mm attachment conclusion  this is a no brainer
i have another  that needs mounted
i think as soon as i click publish for this review i will be ordering another one
if you find yourself reading reviews on tv mounts and you have found this one your search is over just click buy alreadythis is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a  inch tv attached to it
i can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through
perfect for my needssturdy and durable craftsmanship
bought for my grandma in mexico had it installed and works great
has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your roomif you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get
my  samsung d tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required
i mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure
i am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problemgreat wall mount at a great price
already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last
i really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom
easy instructions im not a carpenter
i used this on a  samsung led tvgot this to hang a  sony lcd in my bedroom
used my stud finder to locate the studs drilled  pilot holes and hung it up
and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv
holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv
screws fit just rightno complaintsused it for vizio  tv
easy to install
fit perfectly
what is there else to say
strongly recommend for everyonemy tv
couldnt ask for more
thanks
these reviews require too many words
i could have said what i meant in threethis tv mount is easy to install
just follow the directions included
i installed this near the ceiling and im using every bit of the  degree downward tilt
properly installed the product is rock solid
i installed a  tv on it
i know it can hold much more
the articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that toothis is the second videosecu product i have ordered
they are rocksolid and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package its hard to imagine any speaker or tv that these systems wont fitfor the price it cant be beat
the mount is strong and sturdy
two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting three would be ideal
once up though its better than most of our friends mounts
it has full articulation and i can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen
this is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football gamesi originally bought this for a sony  tv but installed it with a vizio  instead
i did this because the sony is an older model tv and weighs a little over lbs which is still within this mounts rating and the vizio only weights lbs
i have a sanus extended articulating mount that i bought a few years ago and paid over  dollars for it
it now costs over  the sanus is much stouter in construction than this videosecu mount is so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up preinstall i swapped out tvs to match mounts accordinglynow that installation is complete im sure this mount would handle either tv just fine
is it the same quality as the sanus
no but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims
i saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install
now this is based on the  lb tv but im not experiencing this problem
the mount has  pivot points and after installation all need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force
out of the box this mount would have sagged like others complained but im guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation processi wont hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises
an excellent price  for a good quality mount
if you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install buy the sanus and pay x more to do it
if you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your tv on save some cash and buy this mounti am using this with a  inch samsung smart tv
the extended bars were not needed
this is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts
many bolts are provided to fit with your television
it is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways
highly recommendedthis mount is heavy strong and already in one piece
almost no directions were needed
the only issue i would have after the mount is installed i had to lift the tv to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the tv up with one hand
i checked the instructions to make sure i wasnt being stupid
the directions confirmed to lift the tv and screw in the screws
other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and tv then i just lift the tv and click it right in
the sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinionthis mount is sturdy easy to install and easy to mount the tv to
the included hardware was heavy duty also
the action is good and tension is adjustable
the tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts or locked in place which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the tv unless they have a wrench with
i mounted the  tv on our lanai so a little theftproofing is a good thing
the tv is now visible either on the lanai or from the patioi recently bought a second one and they have changed
still sturdy but lacking the quick mount feature
now you must hold the tv in place while inserting the tiny screws through the backdo not listen to other reviewers screws that this came with are concrete only there are no wood or dry wall screws
you will
need a stud finder
there are  holes in total on a mounting plate so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud
sturdygood looking
there is a whole set of machine screws formy guessall tv types plus couple of tools that you will needi purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance
the problem with wall mounting flat screen tvs is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the tv you buy
im using this mount with a vizio eme inch and it works perfectits sturdy holds my tv really good its adjustable  really really easy to install
an excellent product
i would definitely recommend iti got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office
price was good and it worked
the adjustments on it work well and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place
dont hesitate to buy
i think i am using this with a  tvit does the job and it wasnt too hard to install so im a happy tv viewer
nothing bad to say about it
came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model tvsi have this wall mount installed outside
i have a  hanging on it in my backyard
easy to install and have had no problems what so everthis unit has worked perfectly in holding a  tv in an extended position for months  without sagging or failing
very happy with the purchasei must admit im very cautious of what i buy especially when ive seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one
bracket arrived much faster then what amazon estimated and was well packaged
the directions were adequate but im very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my sony  lcd in under a half hour
my hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there
including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea
and tossing in a  hdmi cable was the icing on the cakeworked great
easy mounting and setup
 vizio  lcd hung perfectly
it is a heavier tv around lbs and it mounted up greatthe nook tablet in both the gb version and  gb version are the best color ereaders of   both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price barnes  noble provides to its membershowever they are designed for readingif you want a gaming tablet a skype video tablet or need access to thousands of apps you need an ipadi have owned a brand x color ereader for about a year but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain
i have a nook simple touch ereader that is wonderful for books but its eink screen is black on white only which does not work well for colorful magazines such as automobile or national geographicbarnes  noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the nook tablet for much less than the price quoted by internet vendors so i took advantage of their offerplus the staff of my neighborhood barnes  noble were very helpful and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the ins and outs of their new tablet
mine is the gb version which works as well as the gb version
i added a gb memory card so my nook has more storage for books than i could ever fillthe nook tablet is the best of both worlds
it is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain
the fonts are very clear very sharp and have very high contrast enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level eliminating eye strain
independent tests have verified that the nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color ereader or color tablet because the screens glass cover is bonded directly to the lcd eliminated the air gap that causes glarethe vivid color makes magazines pop even more than their paper versions
barnes  noble adds a special text only option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long filethe nook shop does not work as well as the nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books
so i downloaded the dolphin hd browser from the nook shop and use it to look at the nook shops book inventory
the dolphin browser uses tabs so i can put two or three books i am considering in their own tab and switch back and forththe nook tablet has pandora radio installed so i can listen to my favorite music while i read books
the sound is weak through the nook tablets puny speaker but wonderful through good earbuds
i also transferred about fifty of my favorite cds to the nooks memory card so i can listen to music even when i am not near an internet connectionwhen i get tired of reading the nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on netflix or tvcom
movies on netflix look wonderful because the color balance on the nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available
skin tones are difficult to get right but the nook tablet does a great jobmany reviewers make the error of comparing the nook tablet to fullblown tablets such as the apple ipad
the nook tablet is designed to be an ereader and for that purpose it is superior to any of its seven inch competition
the fact that it includes pandora radio and netflix is a bonusbut it is an ereader
the nook shop has a relatively small number of apps each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the nook tablets seven inch screenmost android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screenthe reading apps for children are impressive
last week i downloaded a free childrens book that combined the best of the book world and the video world
the book played music in the backgroundas a character walked through a field the flowers were swaying in the wind
the book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud and an option to turn the voice off so your child can read the book to herself
many of the childrens reading apps are free or cost less than  a bargain compared with the  or  childrens books sell for in storesthe nook website offers a book of the day for adults and a book of the day for children
the illustrations in the childrens books take advantage of the nooks color screen
yesterdays childrens book was mary poppins a bargain for but the real mary poppins seems a bit scary compared with the julie andrews disney versionfor people who want more than just the worlds best ereader amazoncom sells a  sd card that converts the nook tablet into a conventional android tablet with full access to google play and its vast array of android apps
just put the na card into the nooks card slot and restart the nook
when you want to use it as just an ereader take the na card back out
best of both worldsthe best seven inch color ereader becomes a very good seven inch android tabletnow i have like four different kendels and i am such a fan
my darling daughter n law requested this
no way says i  then i see these reconditioned ones with a warranty cases n protective films new chargers and  gb hd
had to get it or her
only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies and i guess i love her like mad toothis is excellent tablet excellent touch screen response and button controls
when you hold it in your hand you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handlingmy m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good
battery is also good last about  hours the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on noon web but i heard theres a way to sideload adds from amazon that i havent tried yet
but yes i would highly recommend iti love nooks
kindle fire is ok but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experiencei bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in bn and seeing how amazingly responsive it is
i did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it almost buying him a kindle fire because i thought it was more manly looking
after much consideration and comparison of hardware i opted to get this one
the big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the sd card
i have seen the na nookandroid sd cards here on amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didnt want to pay that much for one so i did some googling and figured out how to make one myself
i purchased a gb micro sd card and in about an hour and a half had the thing booting to cm from the sd card and now it has full tablet functionality
it runs awesome super smooth and very responsive full tablet capabilities including running rd party apps and access to the google play store and all without rooting or voiding the warranty
all he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the sd card which he never does
it is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks my husband loves it and couldnt be happier with it
he uses it every day
the only thing it doesnt have that i consider a negative is a camera
my tablet acer picasso has a camera and i do actually use it quite a bit but my husband says he wouldnt use one  on a tablet so it doesnt bother him anyway
he also dowloaded kingsoft office and now uses this for work as well
unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price and dont let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it just go around itthis is such a great tablet
one time didnt work
acted weird really weird
needed to be cleaned
now i keep eyeglass cleaning clothes disposable for it
has worked like a charm since
hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away
book reading is great too
i use it for an ereader with games that i sometimes play but mostly as an ereader
recommendedgreat product  works just as described have had no problems with it since i got it thanks for a great producti do not understand people they are comparing this  tablet with  ipad of course it is not gonna be the same
i would recommend this tablet to everyone especially for the kidsmonths later i am still happy with this tablet but you should know  things
one is youll get it for  if youre a bn member
also if you go online often they have a deal such that if you buy a years subscription to the ny times they reduce the price of the tablet
to get the members discount youre better off going to a bn store
but the big thing is if you already own kindle books barnes and noble stupidly dont provide a kindle app however you can buy the cheapest na card either on amazon or on nacom
this allows you to boot your tablet up as a full android tablet like the  ones and you can get the kindle app on that
theres no problem accessing your kindle books on the nook
since as noted below the nook ereader is beautifully designed much better in my opinion than any kindle so i use my na card only when im reading a kindle book
i find bn and amazon charge about the same for books
there are some books on nook that kindle doesnt have and some on kindle that nook doesnt have
however only nook has the page perfect editions and the enhanced editions of books with embedded video audio clips and animationsone other thing the nook has a tab for my stuff so you can download music pictures videos and documents easily onto the nook
you dont have to buy music for it
use whats on your pc or what you rip from disk
i am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over  pictures
for that i bought a  disk san drive for the nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a nook app
i dont know how you could do that on the  gig fire
i dont know if you can put pictures on the cloud for the fire
however i can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the nook tablet without any cloudi got this and the kindle fire on november    then came days of comparing them side by side
you can see my review of the fire on its pages customer reviews so how about the nook
first of all if you want one get it from barnes and noble
it cost  with a years subscription to the ny times
even without that discount it costs  with free shipping and this month the nookcolor tablet is only 
hands down for the money there is no finer tablet than this nook
some reviewers say theyre going to get a sony or a galaxy for their features
i have no quarrel with that but you pay for those features
sony and galaxy are fine tabletsive tried them out too
however the sony is on sale for  this month and the  bit is on sale for 
comparing it side by side with the nook the sony salesperson said wow
its as good as the sony
yes and for about the half the priceanother salesman lamented that the sony doesnt have the netflix app which comes with the nook
of course sony wants you to buy their movies
barnes  noble just wants you to buy their books which is fine for a bookaholic like me
bn has  titles available over  free
since they have a lot of earlier editions of books book freaks like me can purchase those or get them free
they even have a page perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books
what you see on your screen is what a reader in  or  saw brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books
youd pay a fortune for them in their original editions not 
many childrens classics are in this series but also adult books like butterfliesthe nook also has enhanced editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text
some of the old books are also enhanced
changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined
you touch them and can see what the original had
one of my nook books is a collection of kafka
you touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street kafka has mentioned or of a notable person hes alluded to
in general ebooks are superior to paper if they are on a tablet with access to the web
you read in more depth and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience
the nooks connection to the web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks look up and google or wikipediathe nook comes with pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the usb cord which comes with the nook
pictures videos and documents can all be downloaded to the nook which has builtin folders for each and if the  gig iof the tablet is  not enough for you you  can put a  gig or smaller sd cardthats not all
if youre app happy you  can buy the na card for the nook tablet which gives you every app in the android marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty
i myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the nook with new ones being added each week
truthfully if its apps that are what you want most in a tablet the way to go is the ipadfor  at the leasti gave my granddaughter a nook tablet
many of her friends have ipads however she says she can get the same apps as her friends do
using the drawing app she designed her birthday party invites on her nook and then emailed them also using her nook email
she says she prefers angry birds on the nook
i cant comment
angry birds dont tempt me but i do play some games on my  nookthe nooks have no cameras or face time but with the money you save by buying the nook you can get an iphone which does  have both
if you want features like that in a tablet it costs  or more plus monthly data fees
no data fees with the nook of course although you can browse the web with ease and speed depending on your routeryou can stream movies and tv stories with ease on the nook
the picture quality is excellent if your wifi is
im in a rural area with no g but i still get crisp clear movies with my wifi device
apps standard on the nook are hulu smithsonian showtime and netflix
there may be more sources of flicks on it but truthfully i havent lookedand since they add apps every week you have to keep lookingif like me your primary use for a tablet is reading the nook is tops
their ereader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive
it even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter youe on
notice it displays page numbers not locations like the fire
if you cant remember  who a character is put your finger lightly on the name
 popups show instantly
touch find and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on complete with it sentence
you can do this with place names as well
the other choices are highlight note share look up
the share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your contactsnot social networking sites
for those you use the share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen
my friends tell me they love getting these passages from me
of course i choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion weve had
other reading options are go to page back find for when you want to type in the search screen contents text options brightness and discover
this last shows you other books on the subject youre reading about or by the same authorin short as an ereader the nook is tops
as a tablet it does well although not as well as those that are way more expensive
actually everything it does do it does very well
it just doesnt have certain featuresbut that is true of every tablet ive seen except the ipad
as of now the ipads picture quality is not as good as the nooks or for that matter the fires
the ipad will have hi def howeveri bought this ebook g for my kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email
it does the jobs well until now
i personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance
with low price fast response and light weight book size and barn and nobles support it is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computeri am a fan of amazoncom and meant to buy a kindle for my children
but the displayed sample on my local bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire
it could not be generally true but based on the displayed tablets i had to choose the nookuntil now i have had mainly happy experiences with it
it has apps for children one of them has many smithsonian videos that my small children love the most
my college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow
after you turn it off and restart it hold the power button for seconds for on and off it become fast againi just found last day it has a recipe app with more than  recipes
it has pictures for most of the productsmy children have asked me to buy the istory app for  dollars but it contends  or more story books for children that it reads to my children
wonderful
the american history app is excellent too it costs me  dollar or so not remember exactly nowproblems it did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running
after the battery was charged for a whole night it still refused to start
when i tried again in the afternoon it started but took more than  minutes
i guess the software was damaged and repaired
it is now as good as it was before
i am still wondering what was wrong with itit is not a computer and can not be connected to tv
only one or two of my children can use it in the same time
we still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos togetherit was designed for you to buy their books
but i think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version
i would rather buy some hard copies instead
however one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each
she is happy with the booksas a summary the machine is excellent sturdy fast and convenient for emails and web browsing
the books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books
apps for children are wonderful
my children love itthe nook tablet is greati have used it to check emailbrowse and look at booksand also transferred one from my pci like the way it will sync with the direction its rotatedand i love the touch screenthanks amazoni read all the reviews and decided to buy this barnes and noble nook for my grandson for christmas it was used but with original box and accesories  through ez corps
and im happy to say this barnes and noble is the best i ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful
lets put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the barnes and noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the barnes and noble nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps
and i told her i did my homework and looked this nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kidyoung teen best nook ever invested in money and used at that but i will only order used if the item says like new with original box with accesories 
and  i will only order anything used through ez corps
best company to ever order anything from on amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling 
and there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus
i would highly recommend this company any day to any one  friendsfamilyetcyes this barnes  noble nook is well worth ordering used or new
thank you kristen catesi could not be more pleased with  or impressed by  the nook tablet
i know that amazon is enemy territory but the nt does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a kindle firenot only can i use my netflix account but i also have full access to the amazon prime website to watch films and videosthe screen is incredible  bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full gig of ram
i poppedin a g micro sdhc card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs pdfs mps and mp videosand of course the primary use its now much easier to read in bed at night
the backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading lighti have tried the ipad the kindle and the sony and nothing has worked better than this nook tablet
its light the screen resolution is amazing for movies and the applications i use work beautifully
even the speakers are excellent for what they are
no complaints at allnice specs with nice screen
not worth the price with just the stock operating system might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model
you cannot use the larger gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at bn restricts your access to only gb of that memory
update because of the unhappy owners bn will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get gb free spaceas is the unit is severely crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs
turn this baby into a great android tablet by rooting it  easily and painlessly done by buying one of those sd card based kits
i got a  gb card with the root kit and i now have full access to android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired
you can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under  like new used but remember you get a unit thats a generation old and doesnt have bluetooth gps and hdmi out like most other newer tablets havethis thing has been through so much
closed in doors thrown across the room been the object of desire in a toddler tug of war and it still keep working
it i just fantastic
to any one complaining that he app store for barns and noble is too small i say just sideload google play with the root kit
it is easy and doecker skills to doim happy satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my nook
honestly it worths more than a five star ratingi will recall a phrase in a movie it came to a certain point when i had to decide between style and substancethats right
i got both on this tabletthe product arrived two weeks ago i did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so i immediately starting getting books nowadays i have plenty of nook books to read aheadmy coworkers and friends love the aesthetics of the nook look as i love all the features in the devicepros all of them the screen is so clear wows
me all the time fast response to tasks easy menu fast processor micro sd card slot added gb extra fun big smile lightweight long life battery

it excels at ebook reading and has many functions as a tablet as well
this is a minor upgrade for nook color owners but a major upgrade for those going from the nook or kindle eink display readerpros vividview ips touchscreen bonded for glare reduction

it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet
i have dropped it a few times and it is still okayi have used several different  inch tablets
the best i used was the galaxy tab  plus
this is a less expensive tablet and very very good
but rooting the nook tablet made it greatthat is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading
there are stepbystep videos on how to do this and links to necessary files
all you need to get you started is google root nook tablet
yes when it is rooted it does void the nook tablet warranty but it can be unrooted without problemsthe screen is beautiful it is fast and with the micro sd card slot has plenty of room for storage
i bought my gb for 
a great tablet for the price and i use it every day
great purchasethe galaxy tabs are noted for audio quality and of course have some features that can be useful
but the nook tablet is mighty fine and a great investment for the pricejust picked up a refurbished nook tablet from neweggs website and its amazing
only has a  x  pixel screen but from a foot away you cant tell the different between this and a device with  x  pixels or more
reading is a pleasure
ive had all the kindles and all the nooks and for the best overall reading experience the nook is betterwhy
the nook devices feel great to hold
the plastics are soft all the buttons are in good places and recharging takes no time at all
also the software layout and navigation is easy and logical
next the font choices sizes and other personalizations are all useful
and finally no freaking ads
you can personalize your home screen and on the nook touch you can select your own photos for the screen saverwhats my problem then with kindle
couple things
the ads of course
also i personally dont care for the software
you are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it
boring
also the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off
on the lower priced kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass
and the devices arent as nice to hold
at least on the fires they took the idea from nook on making the backs have a soft plasticim pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both nook and kindle will like the nook better
as reading devices go they just make more sense
as far as a full fledged tablet goes youll have to look to apple or samsung in my opinion
matter of fact i am writing this review on my ipad and shortly i will go back to reading on my nook tableti love using this
its light and easy and fast
love that is has hte capability of google play on it
so hard to find things that are compatiblemy wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text largeri was looking at expensive tablets that were more like mini notebook computers
i already have a high end notebook
i wanted something that was very portable and not combersome to take on trips go to coffee shops and etc
i wanted the ability to get email do limited surfing and read books
the nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice
i have an n protocol router and the nook is quick on the net
i read some negative reviews here
they appear to be written by folks who want to take a  unit and turn it into a  unit with various apps and other applications
heres a news flash for the naysayers
go out and buy the  unit and quit complaining
if you want to read books surf and get email youll like this unitrooted and cyanogenmod installed works awesome
the nook tablet has a bit more memory than the original nook color so thats why i got this onethe bn nook is a great device
the hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos reading books or surfing the web
the builtin apps are great as well as the overall layout and options
the major drawback is the inability to load rd party appsbut roll back to firmware  and load all you want before upgrading
or root it although amazon instant video will not work after rootingi got a gb microsd off of amazon for under  and it holds just little over k books it was what swayed be over the kindle fire that and the gb of ram vs mb
now that they released a gb nook for  its price point is on par with the fire and has the option of expansion and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher and i can easily install the amazon app storeand kindle app android market place and have a very decent wifi tablet tbh i wasnt much of a analog book reader but with this little nook tablet ive been averaging a book a week along with  monthly magazine subscriptionswhen the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back hrs later it was less then what i expected but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressivebattery life is decent depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage unless i am at home i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half and wifi off and get about hrs of nonstop read time  days of casual readingstandbygreat product great sale i love this product and my children will too i cant wait til christmas to give them their presentthe nook hd was designed to be a book reader although it also is a great way to watch videos on netflix or listen to pandora radio or to your favorite music
i added a gb memory card so that i can have thousands of my favorite songs with me when i travelthe nook hd has a screen with the best resolution and the least glare and reflection of any color ereader
it is the only color ereader that comes close to the reading experience of an eink readerbarnes  noble has lots of childrens books that take advantage of the nooks color and audio features
i bought a christmas story that can read out loud in english or spanish and on each page something would be movingsnow falling or the moon moving across the skythe nook is very light which makes it easy to read for hours and you dont mind having your nook with you  in your purse or man purse i use a small laptop bagthe barnes  noble selection of ebooks is huge and includes  of best sellers
each day there is a book of the day for  or many of them bestsellers or classic booksive owned an ipad  an original kindle fire and first generation g dual screen nook
i decided it was time to upgrade my original nook and went with this tablet
i purchased mine direct from bn
this is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions
i really like the interface on this ereader more so than the kindle fire
dont get me wrong the kindle fire is a very nice device but i like the personal touch i can give the nook hd
its more customizablei can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen
the ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured grippy back
the screen resolution is fantastic
even small print is readable
the colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch
i really appreciate having a physical home button and external volume rockers  power button
the interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing
setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated
web browsing is very zippy on this device
more zippy than the kindle fire
ereading is also a pleasure with customizable fonts  backgrounds
i was surprised at how well i was able to read on it outside in the shade
it still has a lot of glare but it is much more readable than the ipad or the kindle firei cant see the ipad or kindle fire screen at all outside with all the glare
nook hd is not as readable as an eink screen so i will be keeping my original nook of  years for outdoor reading
but for a tablet ereader i was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade
i have since given my husband the ipad  as i like the  form factor of the ereadertablet devices
i take them with me everywhere
if you were to ask me which i liked better the kindle fire or the nook hdwelli wouldnt be able to choose
amazon has a larger store for books apps movies etcbut i like bns nook hd for its interface superb screen and customizable home screen
it also has expandable memory and you can sideload epub books
i also like the look of the nook hd better
it would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with
all in all the nook hd is a great device that hasnt gotten the attention it deserves and is worth serious considerationi got this for my little girl as she filled up her gb tablet with games
we just love the nook hd tablets
the fact they have google play and you can change the background to a nice picture makes these tablets superior in most ways to the kindle fire
yes the fires have their own advantages we have some but overall we prefer the nook hdsit has everything you need in a tablet except it doesnt have a camera g or gps personally i dont need them
but guess what it is built in microphone that is good i like to singok
this tablet has a good touch response you can touch even the smallest links the screen is extremely crisp and beautiful x pixel the highest resolution in the  inch tablets
i was amazed at how beautiful google maps is displayed i loved it
it has a dualcore  ghz processor and  gb of ram it is quick and very responsive but dont abuse it is only a tableti decided to get this tablet instead of the asus nexus  because it is lighter it only weights  oz this is a good factor if you are planning to use it for long periods of time
i use it for reading colored magazines and illustrative books
besides it is easy to gripthe battery last about  hours if you use it only for reading and about  hrs if you watch videos or use it in wifi modethe new software updates give you access to google play
it couldnt be easier
you dont deal with any annoying promos and the charger and wire is includedbought a  gb one at my local bn store on sale at 
fantastic
it is totally android hooked right into the googleplex like google maps and the google play apps store where you guessed it i immediately downloaded the free musthave amazon kindle app perfect
i might buy the bn tablet but books
amazon all the way
and free acrobat reader which will still enlarge any vector line art in a pdf to  just like on a pcmac
note  flash and video embedded in a pdf do not play on the nook or to my knowledge on any other tablet or on macslets see
photos originals are  x  shown from my smugmug site are razorsharp in perfect color on the  nook screen
im an amateur photographer and its a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctlyother stuff  it has a microsd card slot so you can bring in your own pix docs pdfs etc
will buy a microsd card for it tomorrow
as an aside theres a company called nacards that sells a microsd card preloaded with the android operating system but with the nook hd in bed with google im not sure what im missing by just sticking with the nooks builtin systemanyway im very happy with this product
if it blows up i can take it back to my local bn store and get another
and it has a feature where it backs up all your content on google serverslastly was able to connect it to my yahoo email account immediately
it also has facebook and twitter but i turned them off as im fairly antisociali bought the hd first and am completely in love with it
a very handy size and very responsive
bought the hd for use when size is not a factor
love both
added  gig scandisk to both
only real issue is that i run ubuntu no windowsmac so had to cobble my desktop and laptop to ba able to download to nook
can set video downloads to default to sd card
very happy
thinking about buying one more of each if the price goes even lower for backups in case of loss or damagei bought the nook primarily for reading but wanted the hd for email and web browsing also
i was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setupi did not want to spend the money for an ipad and now i am glad i didnt as i prefer the nook interface for reading
the screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the ipad you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading
the only downside is there are not as many apps written for the nook
i am hoping that will changewith all the tablets and apps out we dont really need ereaders anymore
i am not exactly sure why i wanted a e reader
i mean  i have a ipod ipad kindle regular nook  ipad mini  iphone blackberry playbooki decided to sell my kindle fire and my previous color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook hd and its beautiful  it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps including the ahem kindle appi like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the os isnanif you are looking for a very light and compact device to read your books check your email and watch movies you really cant beat the nook hd
it has the highest screen resolution for its form factor  and is a pleasure to read and write with
netflix  hulu are magical to view since the resolution is so high and its so darn light
being able to expand the memory with a micro sd card is just another plus
allinall im very pleased with it an would recommend it highlywe have both the hd and the hd but i love the hd because it is lightweight and very portable
all my nooks are converted to android and work very wellit is too bad that the nook hd hasnt received more kudos
to be honest i knew it had a great screen a fast proce fast processor great battery life and oh so light and easy to handle
but i did wait for a means for rooting the nook hd to become available
now the tablet lives up to all its potential
rooting is quite easy and it is a great tabletthis is a really nice item
with the way i use it the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web
magazines on this screen are amazing i especially like reading time because of the outstanding photography they do
books look great and the selection of games on the barnes and noble store is alright
a little annoying paying again for games i already bought on my phone but thats not so badfurther you really dont need to pay again for games if you install a custom rom on an sd card
you can either purchase one premade google for na for more info or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things
its not scary at all especially since youre only doing stuff on the sd card not the tablet itself
if you want to undo it just take the card out
anyway the custom rom just gets you stock android and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps
you can still read all your barnes and noble stuff on the bn android app
i read my wired subscription that way as well as some books
anyway i think this device and the rom on the sd card is the best of bn and androidanyway id compare this with the google nexus  the nook has a slightly higher resolution screen which is kinda neat especially for magazines
no front facing camera on the nook but my phone already is great for video chat so i dont miss it
also the custom rom i put on my sd card is android  whereas google says the nexus is android maybe theyll get an update soon i dont know
so either way you probably cant loseedit barnes and noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store
so i dont use my custom rom at all because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the barnes and noble stock software
its a great tabletthe nook tablet is a great color ereader with the bonus of being able to read your email shop on amazoncom surf the web watch tv shows on hulu plus movies on netflix and listen to the worlds largest selection of music on pandora radio
i added a gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs
but the nook is designed to be an ereaderit is not a games tablet or an ipadi got my nook tablet gb version from barnes  noble because of the extra discount i got with my bn membershipthe price was much less than advertised by most internet venders
i already have a brand x color ereader and a nook simple touch reader
my old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions the nook touch is great for books but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines dont really work without a color screenthe nook tablet has very sharp clear and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read even for several hours
there is a night mode and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else
magazines look great on its color screen
i listen to music on pandora while i read and when i am tired of reading i can watch a movie on netflix or a tv show on tvcom
i installed the dolphin browser which uses tabs so i can switch quickly among various web pagesvevo music videos look great but the nooks speaker is too weak to enjoy music
however music sounds great through good ear buds and when i plug the nook into my computer speakersthe nook is an ereader not an ipad or high powered tablet
it does not have access to google play to obtain apps so you are limited to the apps in the nook app store
those apps have been developed just for the nook and its seven inch screen
the apps in google play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones while nook apps are designed just for the nookbottom line the nook tablet gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music i loaded a gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songstransferring the songs over to the nook from my laptop was fast and easyfor folks who want the full tablet experience amazoncom sells the na card which enables you to boot your nook into a full tablet mode with access to google play and the  apps available there
and the na card also permits booting the nook back into its original nook settings as the card does not modify any of the nooks software or settings  best screen on a  tablet for the price range
seriously ipad quality and even sold my ipad  for this
d very happy and would not go back lighter than an ipad
thus easy to hold onehanded for extended viewing
cant with the ipad screen quality is ips and matches that of the ipad
no issues with resolution contrast color etc
one of the best screens esp
for low reflections off a glossy display tablet out there at this time
one of the biggest reasons i bought this
far less shine than the annoying ipads nice loop hole for a strap  wii strap works great
never drop it again microsd card slot
yes
expand and dragdrop media as you see fit along with cm plays more media formats than the ipad
mx player pretty much kills the ipad for how easy it is to play everything up to  on this tablet runs  hours easily reading ebooksin short for the price range and time of this post nothing else better for a  tablet
wouldnt go back to my ipad ever and extremely happy with this  total keeper for all it can do
xdif you buy this from a bn store and are a member of bn you can get this for  which is cheaper than the  gig fire
if you already are loaded with kindle books bn foolishly doesnt have a kindle app but you can on amazon or nacom buy an na card which allows you to boot your nook up as a full android complete with access to the android market or whatever google is calling it now and get the kindle app to accress all your kindle books
since i love the design of the ereader  on the nook i use my na card only when i want a kindle book
i find the bn nook books are usually the same price as kindle
occasionally kindle doesnt have a book i want but nook does
also nook may not have a book kindle has
also nook books have the page perfect series as well as enhanced editions with embedded videos and audio clips neither of which kindle hasthe nook has a tab for my stuff so you can drag things from your pc to the nook
if you want more space for your stuff you can get any sized san disk for the nook
i have a  gb one because i transferred about  pictures to my nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them
then ill drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc
did i mention the nook is a joy to use
i actually got thre gig tablet but the  gig is as fast and has the   hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be addedthree of my children are sharing it now
i do not see the need to buy another tablet because i do not allow them to play with it too much
my oldest child uses it for email news weather and more while in school
she prefer it to a computer even she has to share with her sister and brother
it starts in seconds it weights less and is firm enough to be put in her school bag with cover of causeit has the convenient access to the free istory books free classical books and some games that my children occasionally play with
my older children would record some of the books for my smaller children to listen
it save me a lot of time to read to them
the dictionary is at their fingersnot a bad gadget for educationexcellent display quality
it runs fast and does have more memory than its predecesor
the size is appropriate for my day to day needspurchased as a christmas gift for my son
he loves it
best gift according to him
we loaded a few of his faborite games and downloaded some books
he loves to read and hasnt put this down since unwrapping ithightly recommendi assumed that i had the gb model but the box was misbranded and my bad for not paying attentiontoo late to take back to the store but it is still a very good tablet and the memory can still be expanded by sd card
i have since rootedmy tablet and it is great
i do have the gb one after allit is ok for adults
fine for older adults who are just looking to use it to read but the place where this thing shines the brightest it is bomb proof
i gave one to my toddler boys last year and it still works 
it has been spilled on dropped stomped on drooled on left in the sun and even got closed in the auto door shut in our crappy minivan and it is almost perfect
a scratch here or there but truely you could never tell what torment this device has been throughi wish i could get an apple device this durable
in the same time that i have owned this tablet my family self and husband included has killed no less that  smart phones an ipad one samsung device and a dvd playerthe device has also survived multiple refreshes and side loading software experiments with out even flinchingi will say that the bn app store is pretty pitiful but like i said its easy as pie to sideload the google play store and have access to pretty much anything you wantthe nook  gb wifi tablet was a christmas gift for my husband
he had a  plain nook for reading
this upgrade seemed logical because he already had a nook account
the new nook takes cards he already had
he loves itthis is very amazing
it has a ton of features and has a great looking vividview touchscreen
here are some of the features and things it can dovery strong i dropped mine from  feet to wood floor and it was finevery fast but slow at navigating the home screenhas a physical home button which comes in handy in case you want to quit somethinghas expandable memory so you can have tons of content on thisyou can personalize the home screen with your own wallpaper loads pages fast and plays videos wellhas a vividview touchscreen which does what it says and makes everything vividthe os is tweaked which is nice if you dont care about androidthe microphone works great it has physical volume buttonsover all this is a very good tablet if you just need to do basics like reademailplay games play videos and search the web
it can also do more than basicsthis tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad
serves more than one purpose while its primary function is reading
the original nook is a whole family experience
its size and durability give the nook nook color and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity
this is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school
she wanted something to read her books on and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for herbarnes and noble nook ebook reader wifi only  black  whitei was the biggest nookkindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook
i would constantly diss the ereaders claiming that books were soooo much better
then i ordered a book series from amazon and the booksprint was so tiny that i could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy
my mom lt
gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so i could download and read the series on this
it wasnt cheap to download the books but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me which were horrible because the text was all messed uptypos galore but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the  dollars per book soooo worth the pricethe battery on this lasts so long its insane
i would read daily maybe  hours per day over the summer hey i had to finish the series before school resumed
and i only had to charge it once a week tops even then the battery wasnt drained i just didnt want to give it a chance to run out
i am so in love with my nook now its insane
i can download almost any book i could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little lightweight nookanother big plusmy bookmarks dont fall out of the nook
nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you havent read yetalso when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver
my back loves the nook
i cannot recommend the nook or any ereader in general enough
you can still buy physical books i do and will never stop because i absolutely love them but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your lifeeven though my first nook was free making it that much sweeter i would gladly lay down  for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model not the color though thats more like a tablet pc than an ereaderi asked for this ereader for christmas due to seeing it in a barnes and noble store and learning about its features
it  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the kindle particularly the epub format has access to special offers when youre inside a barnes and noble store and permits you to lend books to other nook users
theres also a little color lcd touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu optionspersonally i havent taken advantage of most of the nooks features yet but i do like what i see so far
the touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and id say its easier to access menu options this way than with just one eink screen and some buttons
i also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microsd card but i would have preferred to do so without opening the device
also if you have a problem with the nook you shouldnt have a problem getting a replacement
i er damaged my first nook through shall we say user error but bn staff was happy to provide a new one for meits not quite perfect though
its kind of heavy for one thing
the touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery for another
and some of the nooks buttons seem to be a little too stiff
i prefer soft clicky buttons you know
maybe in its next iteration the nook will have proper buttons instead of this bendy plastic businessanyway which ereader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences and which retailers online library youd rather have access to
for my part i think the nook satisfies all of my needs just fine
be careful where you buy it from though
 which is the price its selling for on amazon right now is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks lessi have been eyeballing ereaders for a while and i was absolutely certain that i was going to purchase a kindle
well many moons ago i worked at barnes and noble and stopped in to visit and old friend
he introduced me to the nook i shrugged up my nose and said yeah im sold on the kindle
after playing around with the nook i really found myself enamored of it
i like the touch screen
i like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do
i liked that you could share your nook books with others
on the nook that i have and i did purchase a refurbished nook  games included are suduko and chess
the daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the nook users
the library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles
shopping is a breeze either directly on the nook or online
you will need a card be it debit or credit to purchase the books you can use gift cards but i believe that you need to have a card on filei can store and listen to music on my nook i can access the internet mine is wifi and use it to search and answer email or update facebookin short im madly in love with it
i have not had any problems with it
the charge holds for a pretty long time i havent measured it in time myslefit is simple to use very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the nook
i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and russian literature and i have had no trouble filling up my library
storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro sd card just in case but i am no where near filling up my storage yetthe books are also available on my personal computer and if i decide to archive a book but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether i can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account
archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your nookrecommendations i have a silicone slip cover to protect my nook if i drop it i also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the nook when it is in my purse i do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glarethe only downside some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screeni selected the black and white nook over the kindle because i can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the nook
we travel full time in our rv and i have library cards in three states
i can always find books i want to read from the libraries
i havent bought a book since i bought the nook four months agothe display is incredible
i sit in the sun and read a lot and the brighter the sunlight the better the display
try that with a traditional lcd display
since the black and white nook has no backlight for the book pages it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book
in dim lighting i use a clipon book light as i did with paper bookswhile i can use the nook several hours a day for several days between charges an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged
the nook color has a much shorter battery life as well as being heavierthe g option for the nook is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from barnes  noble or if you want to try to use the nook as a tablet computer
it really doesnt have the horsepower for thatfirst let me say that when the nook first came out on the market it caught my eye
i begin to research e readers i even went to the store and tested the nook played with it
i went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well
then one of my coworkers showed me her kindle and i was able to play with it and look at itthen the i pad came out so i went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well
i have read review after review and watched youtubewell the holidays came and my husband bought me the nook
i was so excited
i wanted the nook as soon as i saw it but took my time and compared it to other e readers i knew right from the start which e reader i wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of themright out of the box the nook made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the nook
my husband knew that i wanted it but i waited trying to justify why i needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations
the nook did exactly that
for me the nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase here is why i love the nook i can lend books to other i can download from my library which is so awesome
i can surf the net for free
no monthly fees like the i pad it fits in my computer bag purse which makes it so easy to take with me it has my favorite games chess and sukodu
it was easy for me to download a ebook that i already have but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around the book loaded right from my lap top to the nook in no time the amount of free books that are available to the nook and the daily free treats from barnes and nobles
which will more than pay for the nook over time
being able to call barnes and nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer servicei also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks
for me it was the right choice for our family as when we go to barnes and nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks
it pays for itself these are some of the reason why i love my nook and i am excited that i received the nook for a gift
i can not say enough about the nook i dont have to be tied to one book store like itunes ibook are the kindle store i dont like limits and the nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books fromnow with that said when i visited my local barnes and nobles and received a free smoothie it was so stress free and everyone was so nice i could not believe iti have also downloaded music that i can listen to and have my ear plugs for that i have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that i was shocked
i like getting my monies worth and not having to pay extra monthly feesnow with that said i hope that when you do your research you will consider the nook i am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews
well back to my nook as i can not put it downwhat a great gift and a great buy
updatethe nook is still awesome since i have owned the nook for a while now i came back to offer an updateas far as downloading books i downloaded books the other day and before i could blink they were on my nooki am still happy with my nook and love my nook
i have recommended the nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the nook as wellthe performance of my nook is awesome and i have had great experiences with my nook since the day i was surprised with the nook as a gift
best gift anyone can give
the joy of readingi take my nook with me every where
my children are still in love with my nook and love to play the games on my nook or read a book
my husband even likes for the children to read books on the nook
the nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our familyyou can also go to barnes and nobles and take classes to learn more about your nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the nook has to offer
check in your area to see what times your local barnes and nobles offers classesi also like the nook because the nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week for example if you turn on your nook right now and go to the daily it will inform you what took place on this date
which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not knownas far as the touch screen part of the nook we love it
it does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the nook in our opinion
it is easy for my family to use
 updatewell it is  and i still love my nook and my nook still works great
i just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e readeras of this date our children are now asking as they did before can they have my nook
and for now they can use my nook but i still love nook and i am not ready to give my nook up
one day we will purchase nooks for the whole familyas far as use i was out in the sun and reading with no problem
so many e reads and tablets are currently on the market
this nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me
there is still so much to learn with the nook i currently own
if you are looking for a great affordable e reader
dont over look nook
good luck with your decisionhopefully this update will help you in your decision
we would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity just so people can get to read and find joy in reading
great tool to use to educate children and adultsback to my nookive had my nook for about  weeks and love it
before i purchased it i spent weeks researching the differences between the barnes and noble nook and the kindle and other ereaders
i chose the nook because i can read epub format books on it something you cannot do on the kindle
the kindle only supports pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary amazoncom format
that severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can readwith the nook i have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my nook
awesome
in addition unlike the kindle i can read free ebooks available from googlethe only thing i dont like about the nook and the kindle is that neither one of them has a backlit screen so at night or in the dark you have to have alternative ample light
so i either turn on a lamp or use the small clipon light i bought at the local riteaid for about 
it works just fineso far i have had no problems navigating my ebooks everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly
im enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with  books and audiobooks at a time
i also have some music loaded on my nook so i can listed to it while i read
lastly im glad i bought a case for it because i pretty much take it every place i go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or brokenim very happy with my purchasei loved using this nook reader
the bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient and the reading screen was also very nicewe are now switching to the allnew touchscreen nook that just came out
yaybought this for my wife a couple months ago and its great
i bought it over a kindle because of issues i researched about amazons proprietary ebook formats and to get library books or other epubs you had to do some conversion to get them to work on the kindle
i wanted the easiest thing for my wife to deal with and the nook is great  had a couple ebooks from borderscom and barnes and noble downloaded and library books the first night
just need a free download to manage the books from adobe and your set
its easy to navigate batteries last about a month and my wife uses it every day
buy itwhen i first heard about ebook readers i was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books
i have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me
but then i finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night and due to being away from home for periods of time where i couldnt easily carry a dozen books with methe first reader i had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin kindle ds readers with the full key pad
i was excited about that one but the price was way out of range
i decided to try and go with the nook after my typical prepurchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option and i was so thrilled with it i had nothing bad to say
i used that little beauty for a few good years until i was forced to sell it to help pay bills
from the very moment the nook left my hands i regretted it
i was certain id never find one that good again
and i dont believe there has been any readers since then that are that good stillfastforward to this black friday
the first black friday when i actually have some money to spend
and i am looking for a really good ereader
i did come across the nook on amazon and saw the new nook simple touch which intrigued me because i wanted to stick with the eink display and not have a fullsize touch screen battery killer
finally i realized my love for the original nook had never died and it still had everything i could ever want in an ebook reader
i was even able to buy one from a vendor here on amazon who lived less than half an hour away from me and it only cost me 
i was sooooo excited
now if only i had not wasted  on that stupid fakeleather black cover that completely ruined the casing on my nook high pointseasy to read screentouchscreen responsivelove the physical page turning keys on either side wish the nookcolor had this featuresize can hold it easily in one handlots of free classic books and classic books available for  centseasily transfer books from your library from device to device any nook device or device with a nook appvery organized library and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the nook has been turned offbeautiful design  feels very sturdy and well madegreat accessoriesbattery life charge lasts about  days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everydaymuch better than the nookcolor which gets about  days with comparable usageelend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature which is the only reason i chose this over the kindlefree updates as the software improves you wont have to buy a new device to get the upgrades like faster page turning better internet experience etcfree ebook fridays via the barnes  noble storelower pointsdelay between turning the page not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page which i personally dont likeweight you get used to it but it could be lighterbrowsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome
not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkconclusionif you dont have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an ereader i think this is a great choice
i love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the nookcolor
i definitely read a lot more books now and its easy to take with me everywhere i goi received the nook as a christmas present
i already own a kindle latest generations gwifi
however i soon discovered that not all books are available on the kindle and  of the books i couldnt get on my kindle are on nook
after much research i soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a kindle or a nook
so i asked santa for iti will not tell you i like the nook better than my kindle or my kindle better than my nook
both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereadersheres a few on the nook   it keeps the book title time and battery charge visible while reading
it starts up just a bit faster than the kindle
you can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper
it recognizes the table of contents in pdf books
it reads epub file types meaning you can buy books from borderscom too and read themas for the kindle here are a few features i love about it  i like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen
it reads pdfs much better than the nook more so when you have the pdf converted
the page turns are a bit faster
i prefer the black housing to white
the reading pagescreen has no glare at all the nooks little color panel on the bottom is very reflective and it seems the print is a little darkerboth the nook and kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on
i think the thing i was most disappointed in with the nook are the covers
they are not enough covers that actually close like the kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag you dont want the cover to open and scratch the screenreading surfaceif you are looking for a great ereader you cannot go wrong with this nook or the kindle latest generation in my book they are both on the top shelf
now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unitupdate  after using both my nook and kindle for a while now ive decided i do like the kindle much better than the nook
the page turning buttons on the kindle are very very light touch the reading screen does have darker print and the collections feature is top notch
now my nook the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages the reading screen is lighter and the shelves option is ok  what i dont care for in the shelves feature is i cant colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when i want to search in them
i also dont care for the bn library being seperate from my documents
on the kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections
with the nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them
ive also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom
i dont have large fingers and dont wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy
however when im tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen i just cant seem to get what i want
but when i dont mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it i trigger a menu move
its still a very good reader but when comparing options and usability id choose the kindle any day over the nook
ill purchase most of my books on the kindle and what isnt kindlized will go on the nooki ordered this product and it was not what i wanted
i ordered the wrong one
i contacted the company and returned the item with no problems
i ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it
thanksi have been an amazon fan for a long time
my first attempt at owning a kindle resulted in two failing devices for which i eventually obtained a refundmy birthday is today my brother asked me what i wanted two weeks ago and i told him the kindle
unfortunately at that precise moment amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new wifi only kindle and all models were unavailable
so i went for the barnes  noble nook wifi onlyconsidering my previous experience with the kindle i tried not to get too excited
i went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful
i read that it was buggy that it lagged when you changed pages that the touch interface was not all that responsiveall of this was wrong the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading
the touch interface is very nice and i like seeing my book covers in color
when you choose the cover flow your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment
this was surprisingly helpful when i went to make purchases on the bn store
i know you dont judge a book by its cover but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book i wanted to read uhm many times
i was really intrigued with the swipe page turn that you used the touch screen for however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook
strangely after a period of time it now works perfectly
a representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touchi dont know how much i trust that statement however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well
perhaps it was a learning curve
sideloading documents wow if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila
i do recommend a free program called calibre which organizes your books helps you edit the tags add a color cover or convert to epub
pdf is not very easy to read on the nook but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly unless there are alot of photos or images which lessens the accuracy of the conversion
calibre has even converted files like worddoc html palm etc
calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program in other words it sees the nookdrawbacks to the nook the battery life that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad
bn claim that you get  days cut that in half
i do not know if this is because i use the touch screen to do my page turns or notthe other option being the side buttons but i am leaning toward maybe
lcd screens notoriously use power but using the page turn function does not require the backlight to be on so i am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly
it is honestly not that much of a problem for me
i am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the cpu or an outlet next to my bed
i have gone almost four days with not recharging and i could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that timeoh  and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen
dont expect it to work for your documents
there are two libraries the bn purchased books and your sideloaded books or documents
also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author title or the date you loaded them very annoying if you build up a nice library which is highly likely considering you can add an sd card to your nook and increase memory to  maybe  gigabytes
speaking of which with that ability to increase memory it would have been nice if the mp player interface were a little more sophisticated
an interesting ability is to play an unabridged audiobook and read the book at the same time
i am not sure who would do that but then again i understand spoken spanish more than i am capable of reading it
this might be useful to me in that area if i can find the matching audiobook spanishbook
nuance in foreign language is often lost in english translation
never having owned a functioning g ebookreader i never really missed it with my home wifi
i have discovered several places close to where i haunt which have att free to my nook
i already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read so feeling a need for the g seems unlikely
i have always done this collected books that line up ready for me to read
by the way the in store bn wifi connection has scked at every bn store i have been to
amazingly borders free wifi worked better i just couldnt buy through the bn store
i had to go to my smart phone buy the book and it uploaded
so how do i feel about my nook i absolutely love it
to be fair however had i received a functioning kindle i would have felt the same way about it i am certain
i think the kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touchcolor interface and the side loading documents ability
however that screen kills the battery as i stated
the reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you dont want to touch your eink screen i dont see how sonys all touch interface ereader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time though i must admit i would like to try one outthe nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions laying in bed on the couch holding it next to you even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it
i highly recommend a reading light especially if you had grown accustomed to reading lcd screens in the dark my kindle program on my android phone
it is rather frustrating i would have preferred a kindle simply because i was impressed with amazon customer service when my kindle malfunctionedi do recommend the nook
it would be nice if they would lessen drm restrictions so i could buy books from amazon or any other place for that mattersincerlyri went from the sony reader pocket edition which i really did like to the nook after the wifi only version came out and i do not regret the move
i love everything about the nook and bn reader store
the nook is bigger than the sony pocket reader and after reading the nook for awhile  i just could not go back to reading something on the pocket reader
i like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles
i like the clock at the top of the reader so now i dont have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when i need to get ready for work
i like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next
i like that you can add so much extra space to your device the pocket reader only accepted  books before freezing and acting up
i really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available
i like the fact that the power cord is  so i can buy extra one for home one for work  where sony readers power cord was almost 
i like the fact that i can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me
i like the fact that if there are any questions about the nook i just have to go to a nearby bn and get the help i need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs
all in all i think this is a wonderful device  exactly what i wanted
i usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great
i would definitely recommend this productsorry kindle but the nook is my book
i studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on
loved the idea of an ipad but  is ridiculous for books and its size prohibits simple everyday usage
android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily without being upgradeableso that leaves dedicated ereaders
kindle was out for two main reasons proprietary file format prohibits library rentals and removable battery
the nook just seemed the right set of featuresthe battery is greatabout  hours from  charged
i was wondering how i would like an ereader vers a book and i must say that i dont even notice the difference
love everything about it
the only thing that could be better is the onoff function and wifi
the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on at first
the ewifi range is short
maybe  ft from my router is all i can go
other than that
it works great and at a very fair pricemy daughter wanted one of these for a while and after all her friends got them for christmas we bought her one
she uses it all the time and reads so much more now then before
i hate having to pay for books she could just get from the library but our library now offers free books for the nook that you can check out digitally for  weeks with no fees
now we get all sorts of books for it for free
so happy with our purchasei bought the color nook for a family member for christmas
if i didnt already have the ipad and prefer apple products i would have purchased one of these for myself
i think it makes a much more user friendly product than android tablets and the price is good
combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from barnes  noble and you have a real competitor to the ipad and kindlei have had my new nook color for about  hours so here are my early impressionspro  good quality good color responsive to light touch connects easily to wifi good email service easy access to barnes  noble ebooks
very b  n friendly
very good battery charge lifecon  lousy quick setup guide more like an advertisement only responds to finger touch i prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch
i have large hands and fingers
lousy speakers but i expected that  i havent been able to download movies from netflix ill keep working on that
connection to netflix was the main reason for buying the nook color
difficult to download other products
no night time screen
on line manual  pages is almost uselessthis is my second tablet in the last month
the first was a pandigital novel which i returned because it was an android  and had limited capabilities and no access to netflix
and terrible customer service none
there is a b  n store  minutes from whre i live
in the past i have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable
i will visit them again with my list of questions
ill do an update to this in a couple of weeksupdate
raised my rating to a  
i found out i needed to do a software update from  to  in order to get netflix
the nice man at the b  n store did this for me in about  minutes
i now get netflix with very good reception
at this time i really dont care about additional apps
everything i think i will ever want is in the nook color now
email in and out
downloads books from the public library in seconds
internet browsing ok  ebay access is ok  bought a game for  just to check out my b  n account
easy
netflix was easy to set up
battery charge lasts longer than anticpated
the software upgrade has made the device overall more user friendly
the only complaint i still have is that i cant use a stylus
maybe i can exchange my fingers for a smaller set
not sorry i bought this gadget
also good quality and great customer supporti didnt buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet pc and i was rather surprised with how well it works
im using it much more than i thought i would
most of the time i use an aftermarket android os cyanogenmod booting off a micro sd theres no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this
with the aftermarket firmware it also has bluetooth the micro usb can be used as a host usb with an adapter or usb gender changer and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a pcs usb normally it will only charge with the wall chargermy biggest complaint with the stock firmware is bns app store the apps are fairly pricey apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for there are a few free apps from bn but not many
with the aftermarket firmware im using the amazon app market much better selection and pricescons the sound is about what i expected fairly poor but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker
the micro sd slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove its located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner its well protected there just not easy to access
dont expect to watch streamed hd video however sites like youtube work finedespite the cons i give  stars i think its a great value i have been very pleased with itwhen rooted this is an amazing device with a powerful cpu that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of  mhz and way past the typical  mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects
you will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files but when you do this device will shine
other recommendations are tank hero and jet car and jest car lite the lite version has levels that the full version does not even haveive held off on an ebook reader for a long time
the kindle was always too expensive and even now i dont like the way the screen flashes when turning pages
after playing around with many different readers over a period of several weeks i finally decided to pick up a nook a couple of months agoone of my big considerations is that i wanted to be able to read pdf files in color
the nook easily satisfied that requirement
what i was expecting however is how fantastic the nook is after android is installed on it
a friend of my just bought a new ipad  and showed it to me a couple of days ago
that of course is a wonderful device but very expensive
i started to look around the net and found that the latest android operating system honeycomb can be installed on a microsd memory card and that this will allow the nook to run the new os
even better by simply removed the microsd card the nook returns to its normal state and continues to run as beforei had no idea how powerful the nook color really is until i installed honeycomb on it
the nook is now so great that it behooves me that b  n doesnt simply place android on the nook as the default os
yes its its that good
just one word of caution
as using honeycomb doesnt require that the nook be rooted it is a bit tricky to install but thats only due to the horrible instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put android on the it
as a rule geeks are usually incapable of writing in knownhuman languages
i dont know if the warranty is voided by running honeycomb but as all that needs to done to get rid of it is remove the microsd card i suspect that no one will knowall in all the nook color was already a great device but adding honeycomb makes it amazingi have never been a big fan of reading until i purchased the nook
i have trouble putting it down
im either playing games or reading
absolutely love iti havent really given up my kindle which i love and has its advantages
however i got a deal on a nook color that was impossible to ignore and so i made the jump
if youre wondering if its worth x the price imo it depends on your needs and wants
for people who want to create an inexpensive ereaderandroid tablet by rooting the nook  or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images  the nook color is the way to goits surprisingly heavy to hold  much heavier than my kindle with a cover
the battery life means you cant be far away from an electrical plugin
my last charge lasted  days with playing games an animated screensaver and some reading
its also wireless onlythe backlit lcd screen is spectacular and i find it was better on my eyes for reading than i expected
however i find that finding ebooks on bns site is harder than amazon and i cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for kindle
lots of ebooks promoted on bns nookstore are    or more
too expensive imo
seems like fewer indie authors on there in the  price range i decided to take a chance and rooted my new nook color which requires a micro sd card i used a g card
it requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about  minutes total
i am not a major geek but ive been online for  years and know basic stuff like html not needed for this and moving files and some troubleshooting if i get stuck
the rooted nook is a bit quirky
while the original bn ereader functionality is still there i had to install a couple apps launcher app and softkeys to toggle between the android and bn screensi can watch youtube and surf the web easily
i also downloaded the amazon kindle app to my rooted nook and read my  kindle books on it and get my freebies too
you cant view flash or use hulu or netflix yet
 but maybe flash will work with the next bn update
note that a nook color doesnt have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain android apps
a bummer for me because i like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using nuances flext appoverall my kids love the android side of the rooted nook color and i like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen
so now we fight over it
will i get rid of my kindle  no way
but i find the nook color becoming more my at home reader with the kindle app on it and my kindle device turning into an away from home travel ereaderi have had my nook for  months and the only issue i have had with it is the charger cord went bad but i called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free
im am lost without it
i have an easy reader from nook but this is so much betterill admit i bought it to hack it
if you have no interest in hacking this device then let me start with the stock review firstas an ebook reader it is very good but not great
eink and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled
my hope is that in time the pixel qi displays make their way into kindles nooks ipads etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue
alas it remains one and it is a key criterion for many
as an lcd touch screen it is very bright and colors are rich not saturated
touch sensitivity is a little rough as is accuracy
i did not see a calibration functionwireless connectivity is very very good but for some reason will not connect with some routers
the range is impressive better than my droid   speeds are very good but i neglected a speedtest in this roundintegration with the bn store is very tight as expected
the store app for the nook is better than the android app necessarily you can browse magazines and newspapers for one thing
display of media is wellformatted and fairly intuitive i never cracked the user manual or quick start guide then again i rarely do that for anything i buy
prices are competitive with other vendors and it does handle sideloading of books onto microsd cards
by the way gb microsds are supported
i run with an gb and ive filled it mostly with musicand oh by the way it plays music very well
some of you might listen to music while you read and i am one of those weirdos
this device stock will do just that
overall i like this device but would probably prefer eink if i was buying it solely for reading mediahowever i bought it for cheap tablet use
in this regard it has amazing potential
despite the fragmentation of custom rom and rooting options you can indeed settle on a cyanogen rom and find a lot of functionality on the cheap
i can browse websites easily if i dont need flash currently not working on this rom i use pocketcloud to log into my home machines and i can work from there if needed
id love to have swype on this or even graffiti but it is sufficient to have access to the android marketplace and all the attendant apps i have stored in the cloud
there is no microphone or camera so those apps have no place here nor does gps exist
however bluetooth is available in cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards
thus far the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today
with time this will become a great tablet once flash is fully operable and the honeycomb roms are fully bakedstock  stars
hacked  stars tremendous valuecfor me this is a better purchase than the kindle fire
i just bought this nook color tablet from best buy two days ago  its perfect
after charging it i drove straight to barnes  noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books
trust me the barnes  noble bookstore employees know how to operate the noook and did a better job than best buy at showing me how to use the nook and answer my questions
the set up and navigation is easy and the user settings are user friendly
when reading books i found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes
so i lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting
yes you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume
nice browser when using the browser it accesses the internet very quick
while using the wifi in the bn store i accessed hulu plus the video website
i was in the barnes  noble store watching an episode of law  order
how cool is that
the weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books but no where near as heavy as the kindle fire
the kindle fire was both thick  too heavy
on the kindle fires screen i had to fight  tap several times to change screens
i grew frusrtated took the kindle back to best buy the same day and exchanged it for the nook
im so glad i did
on the nook changing screens only requires a smooth tap
in summary unless you need a tablet for business purposes the nook ereader tablet is your perfect companion when travelingmy friend loves her nooki purchased it as a gift to my friendalready own onemy wife loves this and its one of the best christmas presents you can give to someone who truly likes to readi really like amazon and wanted this for my wife for christmas but why would the change more than buying direct from bni like the service and everything i have experienced with amazon but i would not pay  more 
than going direct to bn
sorry this time amazon i just went to bnthe nook provides a lot of hidden features i read a couple reviews and im still learning more about the product
challenge is to find parental controlwife loves it  uses it daily works good  the only problem to her is when you charge it thier is no indictor light to say when it is fully chargedi originally had a kindle and loved that one too
the problem with the kindle was the button you use to navigate
i needed something more ergonomic and so i bought the nook color and send the kindle back to amazon only had it for   weeks
i just love it
its easy to navigate turn the page download and purchase books  free samples
just havent found the magazines im looking for so with that i will go to the b  n store for assistance
i also had to contact the company regarding a question on deleting samples
they were courteous and were able to answer any and all my questions with patience
i would recommend this product
it is a little heavier than the kindle but so worth the extra money for the ease of usegot this for my sons th birthday he loves it a great gift for anyone great price and it came fast love amazonpurchased for my sons school ar reading program as a prize for his school
this is the third one purchased at the ar programs leaders request
the look on their face when the one who wins finds out what they get
totally amazement
would purchase againi had the original nook had a friends kindle for a couple weeks and now have the nook color
although its a bit weird to be writing a review of it on amazon i felt that potential kindle purchasers should understand their optionsthe nook color is by far the best ereader ive used including the ipad
its not perfect but it almost is
the lcd screen is very easy to read which surprised me since i was a big fan of eink and did not like longterm reading on the ipad
the lack of need for a night light is great and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bugfree
really there is no lag when im using it and the functionality once you spend  minutes learning it is nearperfectbn is quickly catching up to amazon on contentfrankly dont notice a difference anymore
plus you can sideload ebooks from google and elsewherei know thisi will never go back to eink again and love this screeni also love the delivery of magazines on this thing
really its better than the real magazine
you get full color reproduction of text and pics and it gives you an article view if you just want to read the article
it is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers right now its a decent list but it could be betteri also really like the multimedia supporti can load photos and pics on an micro sd card and take my music with me
if im in a wifi area i get full pandora support
i wish it had g but this is still greathaving said that the color is not perfect
first off the weight while acceptable is slightly too much
it wont cause strain like the ipad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed you can lock out the gyro so the book doesnt flip portraitlandscape but its not the unnoticeable weight of the nook or kindle or paperback
still way better than a hardcover thoughsecond the screen while great is slightly tactile not glass like you would be used to on an iphone or highend android phonethis is nitpicky but i noticed itthird no flash support yet and while it is a great webbrowser its not a laptop ipad or even like my htc evo
this and the lack of pinchzoom multitouch affects my enjoyment of the web brower note you can zoom just not pinchzoom
update pinch zoom is here
its very good but not great implementation
makes the browser that much betterfourth the newspaper delivery while acceptable and similar to the original nookkindle is not good enough
frankly its easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery which really is superbfinally and most importantly is the battery
this is not like an eink reader
to give you an idea the other day i started out with a full charge and i read around  pages of a book and did some light browsing
i did not use music or pandora and did not pay any games
at the end of the day i had to charge it again
this was about  or  hours of use
thats ok with me but it aint the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the kindle or original nookanyway it looks like my cons are longer than the pros but really this is a great product
i cant wait to see amazons response and appreciate the hopefully friendly competition that this representshad one since christmas  and already owned a regular nook so i am familiar with the differences between the displays
the nc is a fabulous if a bit heavy device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box
root the thing and it becomes an android tablet giving you access to a lot of functionalityi have no issues with reading on the nc
adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and ive read for hours with no eye strain
im more than satisfied with it because unlike the kindle i can read almost anything and rooted even kindle books using the android kindle app
works with library lending free ebook sites and the calibre tool helps expand what you can read even morehands down its the best device out there at the pricelast year my husband asked me if i wanted a kindle because i love to read all the time and i try to be ecofriendly when possible
i was intrigued but my biggest weakness is magazines and i didnt like the availability or look of them on the kindle
when the ipad came out i was blown away by the beauty of it but felt like for a few dollars more i could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size
for travel the ipad seemed to big and fragile for me i need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about themwhen i stumbled onto the nook color i absolutely flipped my wig and couldnt wait to get one
full color magazines that look just like they do on the newsstand
this could singlehandedly save the rain forests  i seriously buy a lot of magazines
i also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again which drives my husband crazy
so perhaps the nook color can save my marriage as well
thats a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device but i think its up to the challengesanta decided to come early to our house so i just started playing with the nc a few days ago and it is my first ereader
it was almost fully charged right out of the box so i was able to start playing with it in less than an hour it says you can use it while it is plugged in but they keypad is very oversensitive when plugged in so i dont recommend it
it easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the barnes  noble account i had set up earlier that day
if you dont have home wifi you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it
i recommend setting up a bn account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there as it makes the firsttime nook use very smooth and enjoyablebooks there are many many books available from a variety of online sources check the product details for formats please note it does not support kindle format
i understand its also easy to download books from your local public library though i havent tried that yet
the bn shop function within the nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option
while reading its very easy to adjust the font screen brightness and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes
at night i turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed
ive read for hours on end without any sort of headache
i havent used the highlight lookup or share functions very much yet but theyre super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing
page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or backchildrens books the color on these looks amazing and the read to me feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own
i imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too
there arent a ton of read to me books available yet but they are adding more every week
i dont even have kids but these are pretty awesomemagazines obviously this was a major feature for me
the appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous the text and photos are clear and sharp
you can use the finger pinch method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out or you can use the article view feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size
the magazine includes every single page that youd find on the newsstand including advertisements which to me is a benefit because i sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide
magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article
most of the currently available magazines offer a singleissue purchase or a day free trial then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues
subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated
so far there are about  magazines available and the number seems to be increasing regularlynewspapers and pdfs i havent tried these yet though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read
the ones purchased directly through the nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read
better pdf support is likely to come in a future firmware update though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the fileinternet you do need a wifi connection to go online g is unlikely to be available for the nook color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan
so far most web pages look crisp and beautiful but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer
flash functionality is not available yet but is planned and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing
i believe this will be fixed very soon but for now the web is more of a readonly experiencemusic you can load your own music or use the included pandora app to link to your pandora account
the speaker isnt great so headphones would come in handy
im extremely in love with my new ipod nano so i will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this featurevideo our first try produced some choppy playback but i think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box
after that it played everything perfectly with jawdropping video quality
it will play videos in mp format so get yourself a converter and a microsd card and load it up for your next trip
apparently videos can also be sideloaded through the miniusb cord
ive only tried it on the card it reads directly from the card with no problemsother you can add your own photos to use as background or just to show friends
it comes preloaded with a few games sudoku crossword and chess which work well and are fun
lend me is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other nook users and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a nook
it uses the android operating system and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early  so there will be much much more available in the coming monthsim the type of person who doesnt need my phone to be a camera my ipod to be a dvd player or my ereader to be a laptop
the nook color does a wonderful job as an ereader of not only books but also magazines and newspapers and it has some other fun bells and whistles
it does what its supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price
i would give it a million stars if i couldi didnt buy my nook color to read
i bought it because i wasnt thrilled at paying  for an ipad
as long as you have a micro sd card and can follow a few simple instructions you can turn this into a fullyfunctional android tablet
best of all you can run android entirely from the sd card i recommend  or gb and if you need to put this back into nook mode for instance for warranty repair simply remove the sd card and it will be as if you never did anything out of the ordinary
with the cpu overclocked to  ghz i can play angry birds listen to music and download a file all at the same time and thats the heaviest usage scenario i can really envision for one of thesewell for the price its easily the best android tablet out there if you dont care about not having g gps and camera
took less than  minutes to root it once i did all the reading on nookdevsdotcom wiki
installed launcher pro google maps few widgets angry birds and opera browserthe device has great style and build quality and battery seems to last pretty good in my  hours of play time with it
screen is gorgeous
i think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time
that is no deal breaker though as the  size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for readingtried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive
will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books
but my main intention of owning it is for tablet and i would recommend it
i read instructions on how to make nookcolor connect to adhoc wifi hotspot
once i get that working i can tether the nookcolor with my rooted xperia x to browse while i have no wifi networks aroundi wish i have some cons to mention but that would be silly at its price point
its a real steal at its  pricehigh pointsvery responsive touch screentouch screen is easy on the eyes even though its back litpage turning very fast instant and seamless  no flashing or delay  my favorite featurevery organized menudecent sound qualityphysical home screen button very usefulfree ebook fridays curtesy of barnes  nobleelend technology from your local library if they offer this service mine does its a very nice feature to have only reason why i chose a nook over a kindlethe kids books are fun to read on thisthe internet browsing experience is quite nice

i take it with me everywhere i go
theres no g option that im aware of but i only browse the internet with im at home anyway
the battery doesnt last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway
there is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad it just changes instantly to the next page which is still a great feature on this item
its not so great as a tablet though
the internet browser is great but there is no flash support not for the ipad either though and there are few apps
that is not important to me as im using this as an ereader and occasionally play the included games on it when im bored sodoku crossword chess
i like that you can play music and listen to it in the background
when connected to the internet the pandora radio app is nice to have in the background though ive found it rather difficult to turn off when im done with iti highly recommend this to anyone who wants an ereader and doesnt care if they have to charge it back up every few daystechnology changes and grows with each passing second so sometime in the future something else will eventually dethrone the nookcolor just tis the way of thingsi was a blackberry fangirl and converted to android when it finally stepped up to the platebut blackberry was the best for me until droidanywaywith that said as justification for my current qualifier in the titlefor me in the current available items on the market its nookcolor all they way baybeethe screen is fantastic both indoors and out and its readability is profound
i dont like its failure to be as responsive whilst plugged in and charging but when not plugged in ive yet to have a problem with iti love how its divided into different options and that it supports pdf as well as the epub format
there are books galore out there in this manner
i also love that i can share this particular unit with my  year old daughter who is just starting chapter books but still has a love for picture books
we have several tomie depaola books on there already for heras an android fan id of course love to see it connect to the android marketbut i didnt buy this to be a bigger version of my android
i bought it to be an ereader
with the addl memory space avaialble and the fact that the battery can be replaced just those two features alone for me raise the nook or nookcolor head and shoulders above the kindlethat saidwhile i had a slight preference for the nook itself over the kindle im even more thrilled i waited until the nookcolor came out
im looking forward to a long future snuggled up with my new best friendi got mine from bn and im very happy with it
my color ebooks look so great on it
the only problem i have is with playing youtube videos
im using the link bn put on my bookmarksother than that though its awesome
it works really well  havent had any trouble with any ebookshowever some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked updown instead of sideways like regular booksupdateafter playing with it a little longer i got things going better
my youtube videos all work fine and i love it even more nowi have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since i was trying to find one i liked such as sony touch kindle and a few others which are all newest models and my nookcolor is my absolute favoritea few problems that i hope may be fixed with future updates is when i visit certain pages ex googlecom  tap a text box to type something in my keyboard will dissappear  i have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappearthe other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the wayin any case i still love it
the color is amazing  i can use this for hours
no eye strain trouble here  it is able to read every ebook i load onto it
i havent had to buy any bn books yet because i already owned so manyreviewpart loved my nook color before the new software updates and app additionsbut now
wow
i own a motorola xoom tablet and have only had it for about a month
if these updates had come a month earlier i may never have purchased the xoom but with that said and now that i have both their are differences that im glad to own bothnook color for the valueemailgamesadobe flash you tube and much moremusicreading books and magazines with brilliant color prefer the nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize easy to holdand for women it fits in my handbagversusmotorola xoomemailgamesadobe flash you tube and much moresharper picture when viewing moviesvideosmusicreading from kindle and nook downloads to the xoom with their appssurfing the internetsize being larger for a better viewing experience it wont fit in my handbag but thats minequality is amazingmuch morethere are many many things similar to the nook versus xoom or ipad but the value of the nook color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net view videos read your email listen to music andplay at the moment limited games and to read books size for holding to read is perfect the nook color is the best valueand it wont disappointst reviewreceived my nookcolor for christmas and waited until now to write my review
i wanted to make sure what i write will help others
take this device for what it isa ereader and not a tablet
i love it for reading ebooks and emagazines
a perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers openthe color of photos are amazing and beautiful
i can view just about any website but not videos from flash
again this is not a tablet
but i can view many youtube videos
i have downloaded my own photos and they look greati cannot open my emails from my carrier comcast not sure why
the websitebut not the individual emails from my contactsthe touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes i end up having to do things twicei gave my review four stars onlybecause of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreenoverall i do love the size and the many things you can do with the nookcolorfyii typed this review on my nookcolorthe colornook was a great device when they first put it out at the end of  however it is incredible with the new upgraded software that came out at the end of april  you can do email there are apps videos are super
and there is flash
i also like the fact that i can adjust the brightness of the screen to prevent eyestrainyou can have multiple email addresses on the email account which is great for me as i have  separate email addresses
in an effort to protect my computer from emailed viruses i am opening my email on my nook
that way if a virus sneaks in it takes out a less expensive device than my computeri also like the idea of being able to subscribe to magazines that are photo intensive and i can actually see the pictures in colorthat said i still like my kindle ereaders very much for reading booksthe nook color is ok as an ebook reader and the apps barnes and noble offer are ok but i installed a gb sd card with the android os and this thing is smokin
i can watch netflix listen to local radio stations and you can get any of the apps in the world not the just few barnes and noble offeri bought a refurbished nook color a few months ago as well as a dualboot android microsd card from ebay
this is by far the best value tablet ive found anywhere
nc is well made arrived in likenew condition reliable responsive and by booting to full android with the dualboot microsd it is a real tablet with full access to the android market
only cons are lack of microphone or camera but for a total cost of lt its awesome
good battery life beautiful screen responsive and a really excellent reader especially in low light  but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use
i also have a kindle keyboard which i love for daytime reading but the nc works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do
just nc on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind
nc was perfect for email rss games and reading including pdf books and netflix movies
if you have an android phone using this is the same with a much better screen
its a really good tablet as is but with the dualboot msd card it is an awesome dealthis was a life saver for me after my wifes operation it kept her occupied we still have it and she loves great investmenti dont know why people make fun of these i just happen to love mine
its very versatile easy to use you can add more space and its not too big
and it seems like they are getting huge now
i get hours of enjoyment out of it from reading doing puzzles playing games and listening to music
and mine is usedim sure a lot of other potential ebook wannabe owners are wondering which one to buy
i was ready to order a kindle sight unseen because anything that sells that well with so many rave reviews has to be good
then i went to a local big box store that carries the kindle and the nookcolor and seeing the fantastic color screen of the nook sold me on that one
nothing against the kindle but the nookcolor brings childrens books i have a yo granddaughter and magazines to lifethe nook has a few quirks but none are deal breakers
if you can take one for a test drivea syndicated consumer advocate has a saying i am willing to pay less for less
so am i  i actually bought the nook color nc more for its tablet features than its ebook features
i considered several tablets for at least double the price but when the new android os was released for the nc i decided to try it out
i personally have not been disappointedhere is what it doesnt have camera usb accessory support fast processor robust app forum g model and long battery life
but as i said i am willing to pay less for less
i primarily wanted it for basic web browsing with flash capability movie playback email capability and ebook capabilitymy experience has been great so far  i have had my nc for about six weeks
i personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs
movie viewing has been fine and i have had no problems viewing them
i use handbrake to convert moviesvideos to a format for the nc and it works great
i have several email accounts i use for personal and business purposes and the pop support the nc offers is perfect
i am no longer tied to my pc laptop or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone
as for the ebook reader its great as should be expected my  year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me
i download books from the library for her and she loves it
the notation highlighting and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font sizeother reviewers have commented about crashes but i have not had a single crash yet
and i also dont think the stock android os is bad at all but with this being my first experience with a tablet and android os my expectations may have been lower than normal
i am also hoping that the app market will improve over time
i know i could root the os but for the time being i will just stick with what it came with
to sum it up i got what i paid for and am very happy so far with my ncpurchased the nook color over a month ago
i have been reading alot more since i got it  as its so convenient to take everywhere
i have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days
i also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife
the screen is very sharp and easy to read
magazines look awesome on the nook color and its so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house
i do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella which is what i do when at the beach as im cancer phobic
wifi connection is automatic  seamless
the web browser is better than i expected  and i use it often to read online newspapers and check email way better than the kindles browserthere is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the nc even more
or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet at half the price of the galaxy tablet
the only drawback is the weight of the nc  it weights about the same as a hard cover book though easier to hold than a hard cover bookexactly what my daughter wanted
she is more than tickled with this reader
she will use it for hours and hoursi was instantly the hero for my wife this christmas when i surprised her with a nook color under the tree
the device has great aesthetics with a  inch ips lcd display that is one of the most pleasing ive ever laid my eyes on a thin and sleek profile wonderful packaging and nice support from barnes and noble but that as paul harvey would say is only the beginning this review is about the rest of the story
at first glance this appears like just another ereader but with a color screen for magazines and childrens books swapped in for the normal eink but there is something different lurking beneath
this device runs android  under the hood heavily modified as it may be out of the box and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other ereader
in order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device
the process is actually quite simple go to xdadevelopers forums or nookdevscom nook color portal to read about it and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof and fully reversible just in case you need warranty serviceonce rooted the device gains access to android market where you can get thousands of apps games and tools for free legally or for a small purchase price
compared to the currently empty nook app store the android market is bursting with exciting activity
a rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too
sony reader app is coming soon from what ive heard so you are probably going to get support for that store too
tied to the kobo ecosystem to borrow a phrase there is an app for that
emulators for old game consoles are working nicely
playing angry birds on a  inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny  inch phone
stock browser lacks pinch to zoom download dolphin hd and there you go
cant put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen home switcher and one of the freeware launchers adw is pretty nice got your back
a rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive ipad and galaxy tab
unlike real android phones and tablets this does lack the physical menu back and search buttons but a software softkey is installed upon rooting so there are functional onscreen virtual equivalents to do the jobdont get me wrong there are some things that wont work as nook color lacks a g radio camera or gps
the rom is also a heavily modified version so some abilities have been stripped out and wont be available until a true custom rom is available
but more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor ample storage packed underneath and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others
this is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color so their are some rough edges to the process some things will require resorting to the command line to fix
considering what you get for the money this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today
an instant game changer without a doubti absolutely love love love my nook color
one of the main reasons im so happy with it is because i purchased the micro sd card that turns your nook from an ereader into an android tablet
it works perfectly
now i can enjoy the nook ebooks but also have access to all the android apps and featuresive owned the sony prs kindle     sony prssc and the nook color
each one has advantages but none more than the bn nook color
hold the nook in your hand and you hold a reader tablet pc mp player and photo viewer
it seems like it should be a workout but no so
with an optional leather cover many cool choices at bns site it weighs in at about a pound
heavier than the kindle
sure but also does so much morethe features that make this a standout are the  color touch screen full keyboard and androidbased browser
the browser is a mac so flash video is not supported but all others are
youtube facebook twitter email and everything else appears just as it does on your pc
page turns are an effortless swipe on the screentwo things i consider drawbacks are first and foremost the battery life
dont expect more than  or  hours
bn says  days but thats in hibernation mode
that drawback is kind of big
im forever charging the nook and charge time is  hours
the other drawback is backlighting which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen
adust the page color in settings and reduce the eyestrainaside from the battery life the nook color is the best thing going out there
youll enjoy carrying up to  books with added sd memory card staying connected with wifi and it all comes to life on the longoverdue color touchscreen
open connect enjoyordered the e reader for christmas last year
as of today my daughter is using it and loving it
she says no regret she loves iti have had my nook color for about three months now and i must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root
this is a great bargain for  once you turn it into a full fledged android tablet
forget about nooky froyo and go directly for cyanogen mod
you can then install the bn nook reader app and amazons own kindle app along with s of other apps like angry birdswe bought two of these  the amount of reading were doing has significantly increased
since it is epub compatible we can borrow from the library download from guthenberg and google as well as purchase from bookstores
the screen is bright and visible in the sun
wireless n connectivity is fast and easy
web browsing is fast and useful
pdf ms office document viewers work well
battery life is surprisingly good
we have two of these and an ipad  the nook color is what were tending to use  mainly because of the size and weight
the ipads chiefly used as an expensive toybarnes and noble bet the farm on this device and it paid offi bought this used but i was pleasantly surprised that it was like new
i rooted it and made ita droid pad
im using it right now to write this
i like it better than my ipadi purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it
product met all of her needs and  she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle
battery lasts a good amount of time and i can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accidentmy girlfriend uses it every single day
i bought it for her as a christmas present
and she loves iti already had two of these in the household but my son has been asking for his own since the first day i got mine
i am very pleased with the nook color as it does a wide range of functions
i have been able to do my university homework and write papers on mine in addition to reading ebooks pdfs and watching videos
my daughter reads listens to music and watches videos
my son will be making use of reading books for his age group and reading level and watching instructional videosi loved the nook
i eventually bought an ipad and gave this to my nephew he still loves and uses it everydaybarnes  noble nook color ebook reader tablet wifi only w sandisk gb microsd cardi wont get into all the things this amazing ereader can do
you can read all the other  star reviews for these detailsbut heres a really important one that shouldnt be overlooked when considering the purchase of an ereaderon the nook you can read thousands of free fiction and nonfiction books from most local libraries that are in the epub formatthe kindle cannot do thisi am so pleased with my new nook touch
i have already purchased  books and am reading them all
the best part is that there are so many good books that are free  even one otnt free bibleand most others are under 
there is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the nook has wifii really like everything about it especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by bn or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit bn store for helpi would highly recommendhavent had it but a few weeks but i am learning how to download from the library etc
love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere
no operating problems so far
would recommend it for home or awayproduct shipped quickly and arrived slightly ahead of schedule even from the other side of out countrythe stated storage capacity is rather misleading
it says gb but half of that seems reserved for the system and most of whats left is reserved for bns ebooks
that leaves about mb for the rest of your libraryfortunately a gb microsd card cost me a measly 
even better memory card integration is seamlessamazons got a great price too
 cheaper than anyone else
ironic considering the nook is their direct competitorone thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook regardless of font size or line spacing so you can turn through page  two or three times before getting to page  its a little weird but not a major issuei got my paws on one of these things in the store and im still surprised at how light and small it isthe last consideration not really an issue but an odd choice on their part is the lack of a file manager on the device
you have to plug the nook into a computer to delete files
however its irrelevant since all of my ebooks are on the memory card and i bought a usb adapter for that very reasonall in all this is a fantastic product and i am very pleased with iti must admit i was a skeptic regarding ebooks
i thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand
after purchasing  of these for my wife and i on a whim i have to admit i love itallows me to read books more quicklynot sure why faster page turning easier to find where you left off maybe easier to read for longer periods of time easier to carry with you anywhere maybeadjustable font size so you dont have to squint at small print display is just like a real page and you can flip pages with a swipe a touch or using the buttons on either side
i cant compare it to a kindle because i never owned one but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle doesso simple to transfer books from my computer or purchase books via wifi at bn or at home or even borrow from my local library onlinecant say enough great things about it my wife and i were thrilled with them not really any cons wifi is difficult to connect in some places thats pretty much iti purchased the kindle wifi and the original nook the bw one and tried them out during the return period
while there were things about the kindle i really liked features that other reviewers on the kindle site had written the one thing that made me choose the nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library
havent been back to the library sincenow here comes the nook simple touch reader nook str
i got one via preorder when they came out in early june
it has the same eink pearl screen as the kindle so the screen contrast is no longer an issue
and wow has the user interface improved over the original nook
which i thought was clunky the entire eink pearl screen has full touchscreen capability
on both the kindle and the original nook i felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read instead of using the buttons on the kindle or the lcd touchscreen on the original nook to highlight and select the desired ebook
on the nook str the library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device both library and purchased
touch the icon and the ebook opens
turning the page
touch the screen on the right side of the page to go forward or the left side to go back
or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page
or use the buttons built into the frame
want to page quickly through a book
hold down the page turning button
need a word definition
touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up
the user interface resembles that of an iphone or ipad with the icons virtual keyboard and the physical home button
it even has the slide to unlock feature like the iphone
the touchscreen on the nook str is infrared it senses the heat of your finger again like iphone so a light touch works just fine
i found that on the original nook sometimes it would take multiple touches on the lcd screen for the device to recognize a commandin response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond the preorder nook str i had suffered from that problem
the touchscreen would become slow to respond and eventually quit working altogether
a power cycle generally brought it back
i started a thread on bns website about this and found many others having the problem
i did take my nook str back to bn and they exchanged it
have had the replacement nook st for six weeks now and the problem hasnt returned
so dont be spooked about buying one due to this problem  if it happens to you exchange itgoing back to library books i had to install adobe digital editions onto my pc my library had the link to download  free
this software allows you to manage your ebooks on your nookthe nook str is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills
using the device is easy enough but loading books from a library website via adobe digital editions requires a few steps to complete
if help is needed it can be a positive relationshipbuilding experienceone last plus  once you get your nook str check the shop tab to access bns website
every friday bn offers a free book for download and has discounts on other days of the weekthe reason ill take a eink reader over a kindle eink reader  is because the nook has expandable memory up to gb
when you get to the fire and nook colortab its a different story
the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing
if you just need an ereader with out browsing the web this is perfect
feels great in the hand the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy
although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the lightthe only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another
i believe its because of the eink stylei have had this a few days and i love it
it arrived earlier than expected which is a plus
i have never had a nook before so im unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the powersleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press
other than that i have barely put this thing down since it arrived  good thing im on winter break from schoolwe have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now but it is working great
my wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to usefirst let me qualify my comments
if you are looking for an all purpose epad or ipad alternative buy another product
thats clearly not what barnes and noble designed this unit for
its not intended to surf the web check email etc
it is an ereaderperiodhaving said that in my opinion it is the best out there right now
it is incredibly light weight  much lighter than even a typical paperback
it is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book
the clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an lcd type display is after a few hoursthe battery life is insane
if you turn off wifi which should be normal unless you are looking for another book the battery doesnt need recharging for weeks on end
page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen
assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press
i found most of the time i dont use themit has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation
i had a st generation nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for bibles or reference books
it reads epub format so more than half of what i read comes from the public libraryit is not going to be great for color magazines and so on
you will need a nook color or an epad like xoom or ipad for that
but the downside with those is that the lcd type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or poolone nice feature i use now and then is the dictionary
if you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up
i think barnes and noble has a winner herei just received this reader after returning a gifted kindle
nice screen and seems much more white than the kindle touch i returned
i did root it to run android so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run but in reader apps its great
it also has a micro sd slot gb works fine which is the main reason i chose it
that and the fact that it is so easily rooted with a large support community
i liked the kindles sleek looks more than the nook but the screen on this is definitely better for reading cant speak for the new kindle paper white
i havent read outdoors with it yet so no info there
now i have a ton of ebooks and more importantly all my college text books in pdf format
in fact now that its rooted i can read any format file by getting an app including the kindle app
web browsing is okay with opera mobile
email is great
video is not possible but eink offer a couple of months of battery life even a few weeks would be great which makes up for any shortfalls
i leave my laptop home most days now
bottom line its the perfect addition to the modern students toolkit if youve got a little technical knowhowi have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now i previously owned a sony reader pocket edition and i own a ipad
this device fills a niche if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things get a tablet or the ipad or the kindle fire
this device is designed to read books and it does a beautiful job at it
i purchased my sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it but it was way too difficult and ultimately i decided to purchase an ipad
like the sony reader the nook can take notes but wouldnt be a great device to purchase for that purposeit was pretty easy to set up i didnt read the instruction manual but i usually dont
i just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet my barnes and noble account and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books
i had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet but that has happened with every new device ive purchased so i think its my internets fault not the nook
i went through the steps a few times and then it started workedi really like holding it to read i generally read ridiculously thick books so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that i have to prop up and its so much nicer to read from than an ipad the ipad is fine to read from and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand
initially i didnt realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back so i was touching the screen each time the delay time is a bit longer that way and it was annoying to have to use both hands
as soon as i realized that the buttons existed the experience got even betterthe battery life seems great i charged it all the way up using my usbtooutlet power adapter that i have for my iphoneipad and it worked great
i havent had to charge it again and ive been reading for about an hour each daythe one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when i realized that i couldnt load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasnt enough room
the advertised size of the nook is gb which is a ton of books but it wasnt enough room for the books ive acquired through other sources like google book downloads
a quick google search solved this problem barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble
fortunately there is an easy solution there is a slot for a microsd card and i happened to have a gb one lying around plus they only cost about  if that
i popped it in turned the device off and on and i was ready to go again
not a dealkiller by any means but something to consider if youre planning to add your own epub library to your nookkindle vs nook i havent owned a kindle only used it for a few minutes but my personal opinion as i decided which to purchase was this price was important and i got a great black friday deal on the nook and since they were about the same price i wanted to support the more open epub format since you can load books from other sources
yes its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people wont be interested in
i would have purchased the kindle with special offers and hadnt thought much about it but ive enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen and would probably get annoyed by the commercialsmake a point to put my nook in a case so i didnt have to see themdurability i havent abused it by any stretch of the imagination yet but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didnt crackbreakshow any sort of damageill update my review as i have more time to play with it in the next few monthsgreat product easy to use and set upafter comparing pros and cons this was the one for me
i especially liked that i could download books from my community library and other sites
i wasnt tied just to a brand name download

the nook was brand new in an open box
works like a gem

xray is pretty coolconnectivity kindle  for an additional  you can get a kindle with gpage turns nook  slightly fasterlet just start off by saying that i have tried the kindle and although an ok hardware device the interface was terrible
it felt like the early days of the internet with textual interfaces underlined words fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device
we returned it within  daysnext we tried the original nook blackwhite and interface was much better but the screen had poor contrast
not the nice pearl screen as the kindle hasenter nook touch
wow
this thing has a top notch interface they totally put their minds and heart into this one  it is perfect
touchscreen makes a world of a difference and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store personal library and more
onscreen buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen and this is one device you are sure to love to use
the screen is the new pearl so it looks just as good as the kindle with the added benefit of touchscreenthe size
perfect
not too big not too small
very thin
well built
feels durableall i can say is this is finally the ereader ive been waiting for  excellent battery life good pearl screen touchscreen and perfect sizeto boot the price is dead on
 with wifi
if it gets stolen i am buying another one immediatelyvery very good value for this reader and i am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away
they immediately sent a replacement
immediatelythis is the third ebook reader ive used and definitely the best
the franklin ebookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer
the ectaco jetbook lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well plus an extremely userunfriendly upgrade methodi did encounter one major problem with this nook simple touch  the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised with wifi off
fortunately however i called bn customer service and they advised me to install the latest firmware v which addresses the power issuethe upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches and it seems to have solved the problem though i havent put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet the charge indicator is holding at  after a full day including more than an hour of reading
that compares very favorably to the  discharge rate i had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware
i will report back if the battery problem returnsotherwise i prefer the nook simple touchs ergonomics to the comparable kindle
the nooks front is all screen with no unnecessary keyboard keys
virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something
the unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts and its trim and lightweightthere are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen making for easy onehanded operation in a subway
you have a choice of font styles and sizes and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight
you can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition provided i found that the word isnt hyphenated and run on two linesi like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library you download to adobe digital reader which your library provides free and then transfer the epub books to your nook with the usb cable provided
the program recognized my nook without any glitchesi also like being able to read any book for an hour a day free at the nearby bn storenewbies should note that in their apparent effort to keep the nst instructions short and simple bn left out a few useful ones
notably to close one book so you can open another press the nook button below the screen the thing that looks like an upsidedown u and enter library
to lock the nook immediately without waiting for it to enter sleep mode press the power button on the back briefly
and to tell when the nook has finished charging wait for the little led next to the usb input on the unit to turn from amber to greenso if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics take a look at this nook
but make sure to upgrade to firmware v or higher
update trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader  or perhaps they find me
at any rate i bought a copy of the american heart association cookbook th edition and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marksi emailed bn customer support and they suggested that i try downloading the title again which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title whatever that means
that didnt work but i found that if i clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked publishers default or words to that effect that seemed to solve the problem
so if youre seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be try that solutioni sure love beta testing new products for these big companies  notgave this to my granddaughter who loves it
she uses it all the time and loves the touch feature and ease of downloadingthe device itself is amazinggreat touchscreen interfaceperfect reading screenclean looking design small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and its smaller than the original nookreads formats natively that the kindle wontread all the ebooks you want in bn stores for freelibrary checkouts are easypress and hold on a word to get its definitionhighlight and take notes in a book easilybut when you root the thing it gets even betterinstall the gmail app to get your mailget the opera browser supports flash
install the kindle app and you can read kindle ebooks tooput it in host mode to attach an external keyboardmake sure to get the home button savior app so you can switch back and forth between the bn reader and the rest of the devices functionalityi used these instructionsamazon removed my link
google root nook touch using touchnooter  install go launcher nookcolor tools gmail market  youtube its the top link
i will be buying lots of these as gifts and im going to root them all
this is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers toowhats a kindle
never heard of itbought this as a gift for my husband
he didnt think he would use an ereader
the nook is so easy to set up and use
i have one too and we both read with them all the timei bought nook on yard sell for  in great condition and only later i found how i was lucky
i was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that i will love ebook reader
what i love about nook that i can change size of letters on any e books
for exemple
i download e book pd format i made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints so small its impossible to read
on kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on kindel store
but not e book you made by yourself
i could not find russian e book on kindle store i would love to read 
so i had to go online russian library  download e book on my computer and convert to pd format by myself  its free with nook here is not a problem all my ebooks i can read in print i wishjust love this nookthis is a great and simple ebook reader
its light enough that i can hold it in one hand when reading its small enough that its easy to take with me the battery life is long enough that i forgot where i put the charger and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain
it does one thing and does it well
get a tablet computer i am partial to the toshiba thrive if you want to play games do email browse the web do video conferencing etcive had all the other nooks and this is the first that i truly love
the touch screen is accurate and quick there is no reflection at all page turns are quicker than the other nooks
its very light the archiving and rating process is much much easier
shopping is easier as well
im in love with my kindle and always compared the nook now i love them equally
of all the nooks i think this is the best one i love it
i only wish it was g
barnes and noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers
when i read on this nook just like the other  it doesnt sync with online so when i then use my iphone im not at my current page
in this area the kindle and amazon know what they are doing
im not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new nook
im waiting patiently for medge to release their new covers so that i can use my medge light with both my nook and kindlehaving previously owned a kindle i was not expecting that ebook readers had much improved over the last year
contrast on the display was a big problem for me and i wasnt especially keen that the kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other ereaders
so as long as i stuck buying books from amazon for a kindle i was fine the second i ever wanted to move to another device i couldnt take my books
this didnt sit well with mewhen barnes and noble dropped the price of the nook simple touch to  i decided to take the plunge
note that as of this writing amazon still has not reflected the price drop
the newer generation screen while still not perfect is far far superior than earlier generations
reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the ereader to maintain legibility
anyone who owns an ipad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be so im delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older kindle are resolved with the nooks new touch interfaceamazon released their own touch ereader just recently
while it now brings the kindle in line with the capabilities of the nook it still lags in one area proprietary book format
the nook and all other major ereaders use epub a nowstandard file format for ebooks
amazon for its own reasons chooses not to
what this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from amazon  and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another ereader is the better platform for youi refuse to be a party to that kind of lockin which is why i am very happy with my nook simple touchi have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it
my mom owns a kindle one sister a nook color another sister a st edition nookso ive seen my fair share of ereaders
i did the research before i bought
i actually bought my dad a kindle g for fathers day
but the light weight of the nook touch was great for me
i have problems with my hands and their abilities so after a full day of commuting typing and writing theyve reached their peak
it was the right choice for mei tried to leave this review at barnesandnoblecom but they never posted it
oh wellthe nook simple touch is a great ereader
if you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email this is not the product for you
the eink screen is amazing
it looks like you are reading a physical book
i like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen
either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book
this is very simple which i love
one night i was lying down in bed and went to lay the nook on its side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed
then i remembered that it wont do that which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying inthe nook accepts epub books which means that you can get books from a variety of stores not just barnes  noble
i found that between the bn store and google books you can get all of the classics for free
no reason to pay for one of those ever again
download adobe digital editions to put books on from other places including borrowed books from the public librarythe nook doesnt handle pdfs well on its own but there is a work around
download calibre bring your pdfs into it and then convert them into epubs
once you do that you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual booksif you want a simple ereader the nook simple touch is the best
fyi its costs less on the bn websitelet me start off by saying that i am a fan of amazoncom
in the past month alone i have made at least  purchases
i was browsing around just now and decided to see what amazoncom customers thought of my newest electronic device
i was thrilled to see the high rating but disappointed to see the price  more than the thing costs at bn since its release last month
amazon you need to do better herenow to the product  this is my first ereader and i am certain that i went with the best product for me
as someone who buys a lot of books from amazon i would have preferred to have bought the kindleespecially since amazon has more of the types of books i read and for much cheaper than bn but i just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device
i absolutely love my nook simple touch and i use it for several hours every day
bn has free fridays  when you can download a featured book for free  book share with contacts on your device and social networks and free reading of selected books when you are in bn
my understanding is that i can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my nook this may or may not be any special newsthe touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device so if you prefer not to use it they are also tactile buttons that will allow you to change pages
the home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on  a few other books in your library and some suggested readings
you can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories
they do not look like physical shelves rather they are just a grouping of bookswithout going into more technical stuff that you can read online i will say that if you are new to ereading and you enjoy touch screens   and you are looking for a product that simply allows you to read  do not hesitate to go into a bn and try this out
some people buy this expecting it to browse the web although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack  play their audio files when there is not headphone jack techies have discovered that it does have builtin bluetooth however and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color
it is not meant to do that  it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easytouse reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand readingthis is why i bought it  eventually i will get a nook color  or a kindle color if they come out with one but for now i thoroughly  enjoy my nook which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful leisurely act of reading
in my excitement i am reading like  different books at once
that is the great joy of having an ereader  speaking to those who are just as i used to be resistant to the ereading craze  there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books and when i get tired of reading one another book is just a couple of swipes away
i am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and ebook management tools such as calibre
i am having a blast with this thingyesterday i received a nice leather case for it that i purchased off ebay for a great price
once again i looked to amazoncom first but there simply were not good options
i got a black leather caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucksi bought it and love itthe good stuffthe ui is a lot better than the kindle i bought one for my brother so i felt the difference between them its really confortable to hold and read the touch is great for navigating between de ui but the physical buttons are my choice takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the kindle ones that are too sensitive i mean the basic edition but thats a good thing since i avoid turn pages accidentalythe structure is lightweight and really confortable unlike kindle the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read i have large hands the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior
its a pleasure to read on this thingthe not so good stuffnot sharing on sideloaded content
if i sideload a book from other store the sharing option gets unavailablenot that many formats
just pubs and pdf
i mostly read pub files but it would be great if they support other formats toonot send to option
in kindle i fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless
this thing doesnt have a feature like that so wifi is not as usable as it is on the kindleoverall a great product i liked it more than the kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read better ergonomics and the ui makes it feel a lot betterordered for a freind
as far as i know his daughter is happy with it
i guess you could call himive used the nook touch and the kindle touchkindle paperwhite extensively and the nook is the best
why
im convinced that if anyone prefers the kindle its because theyve never tried the nook
or they have friends that used kindle and dont want to venture out on their ownfirst the nook feels better
it has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant
it has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages
and the side page turn buttons are deep enough you wont turn pages by accident
some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard but thats by designsecond the platform is user friendly and great to navigatethird the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from
plus the size options all make sense
for instance on the kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small i cant see why anyone would use them and to me its a wastefourth the buttons are all well placedfifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own picturesgo try one today
im fairly confident youll love itunless you dontat first i was torn between the nook simple touch and the kindle paperwhite
i chose the nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book
i had though that the nook did not have a good dictionary function but learned otherwise after its purchase
all one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the look up option on the bottom menu displayed on the leftsharp resolution useful utilities convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen
lightweight durable and well designed
essay to download free books i suggest project gutenberg
for downloading free books from on line sites or from the library you will need to download adobe digital edition  software which is freei suggest that you purchase additional memory
barnes and noble only allocates  of a gig out of gig for your personal library from non barnes and noble books
one gig for software to run the nook and  for books purchased from barnes
the best buy for external memory is  gig
i also suggest that your purchase one casecrown leather regal flip case sold through amazon they are high quality for a reasonable pricei was very hesitant to buy a book reader because i really like holding my books
i changed my mind when i bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately
this nook is great
it is so much lighter than my ipad to read with
i find that i use it a lotin my opinion the nook simple touch is the best ereader on the market because well its simple
no distractions of email or social media it lets me immerse myself in a book and i love itreadability in sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen cant be beat
the blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine
i like the android operation tooi know amazon is going to hate me for this but here goesi used to have a kindle  it was great
it made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things i would have liked to change
i wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smallerwhen i saw the nook touch i thought that this is what my kindle should be like
well i decided to buy the nook and im very very pleased
i wont go into an in depth review of the device itself
you can find that just about anywhere
what i will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier
i love the on screen virtual keyboard like the ipad and the fact that its a lot smaller than the kindle  but with the same size and quality screensince giving the kindle to a relative i thought about the books that i already bought from amazon and the fact that i now have to use my android phone to read them since the nook does not read kindle booksor does it
with a little research i was able to find out how to root my nook touch voids your warranty
now when i turn on the nook it gives me a dual boot screen sort of
i can go to the android desktop or the the nook screen
using the android desktop which included the android market i downloaded the kindle reading app
i ran that app logged into my kindle account and now have all my kindle book available on my nook touch
the only thing missing is text to speech but i didnt use that feature anyway
yes it has a web browser email and all the other android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device
that isnt why i did this
i wanted a device to read my nook books and kindle booksi now have the best of both worldsbarnes and noble hit one out of the park with this ereader
compact great eink infrared touch screen microsd card slot twomonth battery life wifi support for pdf and epub and best of all running androidthe str has already been rooted and handily runs android and a host of goodie apps  but even if you dont want to crack your unit youll still enjoy a nice ereader and simpletouse interface fast responsive and crystal clear screen  even in sunlight touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards  or  use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame use shelves to organize your titles view titles as icons or in a list insert bookmarks notes look up words instantly with its builtin dictionary change fonts font sizes on the fly purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer and much moreno ereader is perfect but this one comes close i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices  and the str is the one ive been waiting forbtw if you have an ereader you should also get the free crossplatform ebook app calibre  it is an essential ereader companion and can be used to convert drmfree ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders include the new nook simple touchi bought this ereader and the amazon kindle ereader at the same time so i could compare both together
after about a week i gave the amazon ereader to my nephew and i kept the nook
i am left handed so holding things in my left hand feels natural to me
i really like how this can be held in the left hand and still have access to forward and back page turn buttons
also i like that it has a touch screen in addition to the physical buttons as well to turn pages
also and this was the biggest reason i kept the nook
it has a more natural feel in the hand to me
my thumb rest comfortably next to the screen will reading
overall in my opinion this is a better ereader then the others out therepersonally im a kindle fan
but i got the nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries
the layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle as on the kindle pressing the home button brings us back to the library
on the nook the home button opens a menu then you need to select the options
also if you sort the books by recent it does not show the most recently read books in order but still displays books in order of recently downloaded not a useful functionbut on a positive note the nook combines the touch facilities and button control to turn the pages of both the kindle touch  normal kindle
the borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your pc then imported onto the nook via adobe digital editions
a bit of a hassle but a good option which kindles do not offer
overall its a good companion to kindle especially if you wish to borrow library booksi loved my nook very much its very comfortable to use 
what i  love about nook more than kindle  that i could pick any russian book magazine  on internet download on my computer  convert to pd format and download on nook  i could pick on nook any size of letters for comfortable reading  on kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you bought ebook on kindle store
other pd format books have so small size of letters  only if you zoom text  which i find uncomfortable  like i said with nook no problem
also touch screen work great tooill be writing this review in stages as i hit stopping pointslightweight nice screen cute lowprofile buttons around the rim
touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone s
includes cable that has a standard usb a jack that plugs into just about everything the computer my hub and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargersthis device is hard directed for easy setup
too hard
there should be a way to accept the tou and get to using the device
forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planningwifi  this is the stupidest thing about this device
once you charge it up you turn it on it asks for you to agree to terms then it goes through wifi setup
note you must have wifi and connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue
at this time im stuck
im in a town with limited wifi options so its not like i can just select a local hotspot
until i register the device i have a bricki have an old netgear router gb with wep and wpa protection
the nook is capable of wpa security but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely
strange thing was that i could get past the password but it still would not connect to the internet i checked the setup with my iphone and everything worked fine
customer service had very few answers and only about  steps for me to take to fix the problem
i tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the nook runs on an x eap network
upon googling it this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems
next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try againhowever as soon as the thing charged and turned on it showed up on my desktop and i was able to upload screensavers books documents etc
the device has a very small available memory about mb so text only books can be loaded but not large pdfs i bought this to enjoy the modernist cuisine series mb pdfs
i had an old version of calibre that worked right awayill change this review and maybe the two stars rating once i have something more than an expensive sd card reader to play withupdate after a stop at dennysokay sure enough once in a local restaurant with free wifi i was able to connect register and start using my nook
i made sure i had a couple books on it when i left so i was able to read a chapter before i paid the checkin good light this screen is beautiful
the characters are crisp and clear its easy to read and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts size and margins
in lower light the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than say a printed sheet of paper
still in my apt with only a  watt light illuminating the room its still pretty easy to readyou get two choices on how the side buttons function
personally i like the lower one turning the page forward because i tend to hold it in the lower corner cupped in my hand
however you can swipe the screen to turn pages toothe os on the nook is a little simpler than say the kindle fire
and maybe thats why i like it better
on this device books are books are books
they can be epubs pdfs purchased or uploaded they all go the same place and they all end up in the same list
nothing grinds my gears more than having to look  places for things based on where you bought them or some other phantom difference established by the designers or worse the marketing department  im looking at you kindle
the down side to this that if you have a large ebook library you are pretty much stuck using the search function
there doesnt seem to be a way to organize books any other way
checking online oh crap they have this whole shelf system built in
damn scratch that organizational thing ill get back to ya therescreen saversforget about those fancy things on your pc the nooks idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps
the default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors
nice you can also choose nature scenes
but remember i said that you could upload directly to the nook
well here ya go
create a folder with the name of your screen saver set upload some x pics jpgpng formats in portrait mode and voila
you have your own custom set
i went to nookcom and downloaded a bunch of str trek geeky stuff at first but then realized i could just take a few snapshots and convert them to  greys myself
now i have a folder of a dozen of my pictures as the screen saver
very nice
kinda like having an image viewer as wellcalibregetting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze
i bought a gb micro sd on sale and added it
the card mounts on the desktop separately but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly
so when you put stuff on the device you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card
come to think of it a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well
put your sf collection on this card classics on that one etc
funoh also once i got the registration completed at dennys i went into settings and disconnected the wifi
its been operating in that mode ever since
so only that first time is neededadding two more stars for all the juicy goodness
ill play around with it a while and see if we can get it to   no real serious problems yetupdatepdfs  okay so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document
this strange little device actually reads the text easiest way to save formatting  text  format and produces it in standard format
its a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experiencemicro sdi think my real problem with this device was getting a huge sd card for this then thinking i had to fill it with a whole library
bah
granted those  really large pdfs need some room but i could have fit them all on a  gb card and still had plenty of room to spare
sigh  all that room meant i could have s of books on the device
think tim taylor  more power
grunt gruntshelves
the device keeps track of the shelves internally so its not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computers search function to organize
you must go through your entire library no search functions one book at a time to add to shelves
great if you know what youre looking for but not all sets start with lord of the rings  if you buy this dont get an external card right away
the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff
shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and suchi wont be exploring the bn store for a while a long while
i have a massive library to work through first
so look elsewhere for those reviews
ive heard the store is mighty nice thoughno ads easy to use a joy to read
this my final entry sees that last star moving up the device
take heed of the speedbumps ive experienced and enjoy this cute little reader
now i just need a case  another update months later and ive read a small library on this thing
its a delight
but i still find myself avoiding pdfs a lot because of the disorientation
also to the  people who did not find this review helpful  bite me
leave a commenti bought this directly from barns and noble
i get books from the library on my computer and that works good
the battery life is very good and the screen is very responsive
this is better then the kindle because it has expandable memory and accepts all popular formats for ebooks
the one complaint i have is that when you read pdfs you do not get the dictionary features and some of the writing is weirdly spaced
thats not what i bought it for so it does not matter to me
it has survived many months in public high school so it is very durable
i have of course bought it a protective case though
barns and noble ebooks are cheaper then regular books by a couple of dollarsmore updates at the bottom of my reviewmy review includes details of kindle  the newest version
with the time period i could still return my nook but im still completely in love with it and dont want the kindle for the reasons belowi was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an ereader for a long time
i liked the feel of a real book i was in love with free books at the library why would i start paying for them
then my library got overdrive which is ebooks free from the library
then one day soon after i woke up and the urge for an ereader was there
the nook was my final choice
it took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point
i bought and tried the sony touch reader returned it and went and got the nook
i really honestly wanted the kindle most because im a loyalist
i love amazon and felt really comfortable here if i decided to actually start purchasing books again
but below ill give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons i got the nook nookn by barnes  noble kindle k by amazoncom sony reader touchst my biggest decision maker was epub
this is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library so i needed whatever i got to be epub friendlyn the nook is epub friendly
as well as pdf and many other formatsk the kindle wont use epub which was all i needed to know
it mainly uses its own amazon formatwhile it also uses pdf mobi and a few others
it makes me feel like amazon is being greedy wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site
dont they understand that i love my libraryst sony reader is epub friendly
pretty much the same as the nook
pricen  with wifist  no wifik  with wifior  with wifi and free gwhile kindle  is  dollars cheaper it doesnt give me those free library books so it really doesnt make any difference to me
you can now lend some books from the nook for  days to a friend with their new lend me technology
while this is in beta stages and not all books are lendable
it depends on the agreement with the publisher
the other two you cannot lend at all
the nook has a replaceable rechargable battery
so itll last awhile but when its dwindling you can spend  bucks and put a new one in yourself
for the kindles they are sealed inside
people have said you can do it yourself but you must be tech savvy
or you can send it away to amazon for about the cost of shipping charges and theyll replace it for you
you can expand your memory on the nook and on the sony touch
the kindle you cannot though the kindle will hold  books dont know if you need more space then that
nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom
while the sony touch has a touch screenthe entire screen it was slow to respond very klunky and not very pretty
the kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen
 all three have a built in dictionary which i think is just awesome
the new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width
people used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width now the kindle will be as well
yet the nook is heavier by about  oz then the kindle or sony
the nook battery life lasts about  days with wifi off the sony has  days and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off weeks with it onthis wasnt a big deal to me and i was more interested in the other features the nook did have like replaceable battery and expandable memory
and you may be wondering why did i purchase a sony touch and then scamper back hours later to return it
well
when i got it out of the box it wasnt techy enough for me
it felt like a very basic bare bones ereader
and i already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook books more expensive and for some reason i thought it wasnt epub friendly
but the moment i had that sony in my hand i went to look at the nook more indepth online
the sony online library was nothing in comparison to kindles amazoncom or nooks barnes  noble
one of my favorite reads recently was the hunger games by suzanne collins
it was nowhere to be found on sony
that gave me a bad taste in my mouth
in the past people have complained that barnes  noble is significantly more expensive then amazon
i did some price comparisons of big titles and found them most of the time to be exactly the same
i think barnes  noble might be trying to keep in line with amazon to draw more readerslike me
into getting the nookon the whole the nook is everything i wanted
ive downloaded some free classics from google books ive taken out library ebooks and it was really easy
i even bought my first bookwell ebook in a long time
despite being a new release it was under ten bucks
i also bought another book ive been meaning to read for years for under four dollars
the nook is comfortable to hold with one hand
i like the using the touch screen to swipe and turn pages
and tops on my list i didnt feel horrificly guilty for buying it
one fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book readerupdate oct  a software update is coming in novdramatically increase page turn speed customized bn library organization and password protection
it also includes the ability to sync across all nook and all devices enabled with our free nook apps by syncing your last page read
if you forget your nook at home use the nook app for ipad iphone ipod touch android smartphone or pc to pick up where you left off
and the next time you pick up your nook the reading now page will be updated and ready to goupdate dec  the update was a pinch to install and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable
the shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize
you can name a shelf anything you want
the only limit is your barnes and noble book will stay in their barnes folder while any other books you have will stay in my documents
the page turn is very fast
i do read across multiple devices but for most people that will be a great new featurei absolutely love it
while it doesnt have the bells and whistles of the other ebook readers it does exactly what it is meant to do
it allows you to read books
i bought this as gateway into ebook technology and i love it
the unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy
the buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages
it charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of timei waited until june  until i bought a nook
so far i am loving it
i love the page turning swipe feature
those that gave the nook  star are the ones who got theirs with the  firmware
the firmware is now up to  and the price has dropped to my wife adores this product 
it was our households first ereaderthere is a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro not mini data cable with data capability some usb cables are just chargeonly and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro datapower ability you are looking at up to  unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cableonly thing is its hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use though you can increase font size the rare occasion you have to type something out its kinda small but that doesnt happen often on the nook itselfshe uses hers mainly to check things out from the clark county library district in las vegas
once we registered with the library we installed adobe digital editions which is the digital rights management that took some doing but once in place you tell the ade of the nook you have authorize it and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ade recognizes it and outputs it to your nookafter x amount of dayswhen the checkout time expires the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re checkincheckout the same one for another x daysit makes the public library a whole new experience and thats great because guess whatyour tax dollars paid for it 
and the author gets their cut toowinwin all aroundweve never bought an ebook from barnes and noble yet and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you dont have to put in a credit card but that step is probably skippable its just handy because if you want help from bn theyll want you to at least register the product with themnot a big deal and its onetime during your initial setup procedures and thats the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on typewriter displayhappy nookingps
as a bad pun i told my wife that if the  stooges owned it it would be a nooknooknook but i was frowned at
guess its funnier if curley is your favorite stooge
i digress   this is the most fantastic device imaginable
it has traveled to england scotland turkey egypt and qatar and has even taken a cruise
it has traveled around in a purse a briefcase and a carryon
it has downloaded books in pdf as well as the epub format from barnes  noble as well as other suppliers
it has borrowed and loaned books
it also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check email or the latest news
this is one device that will never disappointso easy to read
a big plus is that when you search for a subject on bn once it has exhausted the bn offerings some free
 it goes on to list all the google books in the same category
if you make selections of google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections
i love the way this all happens automatically
you dont have to do anything at all
you can also add audio books other audio files
the approximately  book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plusi bought a nook during one of my visits to tampa more specifically at the wiregrass shops
i must admit that i was tremendously excited when i got the device because of the reviews and also the sd card capabilitymy joy was short lived
during the  weeks that i owned the product i was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdfs that i have amassed over the years over gb  i am a voracious reader
a long string of calls to customer service and the shop itself ensued after which i decided to take the trip again i live outside of the usa to return the device directly to the storemuch to my surprise they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the devices inability to function properly outside the states and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues
i was refunded for all the items nook cover case and screen protector in no time at allso in summary the nook gets a zero star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader but bn gets a five star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer serviceso i bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this or buying the kindlei bought the device with g simply because it was only a little more and i travel a lot and dont have house wifi
i remember when i used to scoff at the nook when walking into bn and cant believe i ever did that
i love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore with my nook and feel connected to the actual store
i will admit you have to do your research read forums articles etc because the nook demo employees are not going to know everything
also you must read the manual and follow it to a t dont take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because youre going to have battery issues needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacitya lot of people may think their nook is frozen when actually the battery is drained and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver book page etc you were on when it died
theres no powerdown it will just stop and touchscreen will not be active once you plug it up and charge it a little it will be good again
also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster obvious unfortunate factthere are a lot of books available at the moment depending what genre you read especially for teen and scifi and fiction my books and i was surprised to see all of the lend me features for a good portion of the books i was interested in
also bn really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades faster page turning less freezing etc
also even when there was a manufacturing error they were quick to send out a new improved nook
overall i love this device its fun its sleek with a solid feel and its openended for future updatesit may be for you it may not

i think that both the nook and kindle are good products but the nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpartthe kindle
first a buyer can actually test drive the nook before purchasing it at either best buy or at a barnes and noble store
the kindle is only available on line at amazoncom
i cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first
the physical design of the nook is attractive sturdy and compact
navigating is easy
the user does not have to use the leftright arrows on the nook to turn the page of an ebook
the pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen
bookmarks can also be set
this is an important feature for me since i tend to read more than one book at a time
secondly the nook offers web browsing
i was able to link my nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages
although the software is still in its beta stages i am impressed at what i can already do
next i can download andor design wallpapers and screensavers for the nook
this might be a minor point but it makes the nook unique and customizable for its owner
the nooks storage capacity can be expanded
the nook comes with gb of storage that the user can expand up to gb by purchasing and installing a micro sd card
the nooks internal battery lasts about five years with normal use this is according to technical reviewers and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user
nook users also have a community forum they can join on the barnes and noble website to share ideas tips and news about the nook
also improvements in the nook software updates are due to customer input
i like for my suggestions to be heard and the nook engineering team is listening
dont take my word for it
test drive the nook for yourself before you make a decisioni did a lot of research on the different ebook readers before purchasing my nook
i went back and forth between amazons kindle and bns nook
the thing that sold me on the nook was the ability to download books from other sources than just amazon
i can download books from my local library google books along with barnes  nobles selection of over  million books they offer
the ability to download any epub and pdf files is a plus
i like the touch pad vs keyboard on kindle
it took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive but once i got the hang of it it is a smooth way to navigate
one of the criticisms of nook has been some sluggishness with the nook which i have maybe a tiny bit of but were talking maybe a second or so so it is no big deal really
there have been many criticisms about the battery life of the nook but to me its a minor thing as all i have to do is plug it in about every  or  days if i use my nook excessively
it lasts longer if the wifi is turned off
i can go a week without having to recharge it then
i also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire kindle in to have it replaced
one of the nicest features of the nook is being able to go into my local bn bookstore and talking to a real live person if i have any questions or have any problem with my nook
bn has nook stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter
they are very helpful
the kindle does not offer that kind of service
all in all i am very happy with my nook and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook readerive researched the readers for about two yearsi only buy electronics after i can give the item a test drive
upon that note i have always been a huge fan of amazonfor the first time i could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in questionthe nook was available to be put through anything i wanted to try
first of all the new nook in stores has the most recent upgrades
no problem with turning the page at alltouch screen worked great
in the store i downdoaded a book in under  minute and have downloaded  books at home that are nearly  pages long in under  minutethe nook can connect to your computer as does the sony
you can also download from other sources other than the dealerthe nook also downloads without any effort wifi  as does the kindlethe nooks battery you can change at home
it also accepts a memory card which allows you to expand your book collectionthe nook also has other advantagesbut i was only wanted a reliable readerbarnes and noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat packageafter months of research for my first ereader i finally decided on the nook
with all the buzz i of course ran out to bn to see the nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and i had almost crossed it off my list for purchase
however i went back and saw it again at the store after about  weeks from my first viewing and what a difference
barnes and noble has made great strides
a friend showed me her kindle and i got to play with it and i looked in stores and saw the sony reader as well
did much research online as well on some of the others such as jetbook liteas much as i love amazon and shop here more often than i probably should lol
i decided on the nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time
what sealed the deal for me was the sd card option to expand memory and you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery changei am not regretting my decision to go with the nook at all
i have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice but it only did that when i interrupted the charging process
so i dont know exactly what caused that
no problems at all while reading
as far as reading on the nook its a great device
downloading books is fast and simple to do
page turning is fast now
its a dream come true for an avid reader like methe only con that ive noticed so far is battery life
i think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts  days
however the wifi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so so you dont have to manually turn it off
when you activate the menu it will reconnect to the network
so bn is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interactioni highly recommend the nook
with bn updates coming as quick as they are i think this device is proving to be the superior ereaderi purchased a kindle for my wife last christmas
she loves it and uses it more than any other gift i ever purchased her
she was having so much fun with it i decided to get an ereader for myself but i was drawn more toward the nook
i read so many bad reviews about the nook i wasnt sure if i should get it or a kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection
i thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better
i decided to go for it
i ordered it last wednesday from bn and received it  days later
i am so happy i did
i didnt experience any of the the negatives i read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer
talking about the battery its nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a kindle
ill probably never need it but its also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content
and the nook just looks nicer in my opinionthe new update was released the same day i received my nook and i updated the firmware the second day i had it and it runs even more smoother
i have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device
i had no problems whatsoever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for memy wife still loves her kindle but i think she is a little jealous
she asked me why i didnt get her a nook for christmasi was completely in the dark about ereaders until just  months ago
i know during my research i found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader i checked into
if you were putting off getting a nook because of bad reviews i would give them another look
there has been  firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns
thats not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago
im sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only bettereddiefirst let me say that when the nook first came out on the market it caught my eye
i begin to research e readers i even went to the store and tested the nook played with it
i went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well
then one of my coworkers showed me her kindle and i was able to play with it and look at itthen the i pad came out so i went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well
i have read review after review and watched youtubewell the holidays came and my husband bought me the nook
i was so excited
i wanted the nook as soon as i saw it but took my time and compared it to other e readers i knew right from the start which e reader i wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of themright out of the box the nook made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the nook
my husband knew that i wanted it but i waited trying to justify why i needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations
the nook did exactly that
for me the nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase here is why i love the nook i can lend books to other i can download from my library which is so awesome
i can surf the net for free
no monthly fees like the i pad it fits in my computer bag purse which makes it so easy to take with me it has my favorite games chess and sukodu
it was easy for me to download a ebook that i already have but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around the book loaded right from my lap top to the nook in no time the amount of free books that are available to the nook and the daily free treats from barnes and nobles
which will more than pay for the nook over time
being able to call barnes and nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer servicei also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks
for me it was the right choice for our family as when we go to barnes and nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks
it pays for itself these are some of the reason why i love my nook and i am excited that i received the nook for a gift
i can not say enough about the nook i dont have to be tied to one book store like itunes ibook are the kindle store i dont like limits and the nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books fromnow with that said when i visited my local barnes and nobles and received a free smoothie it was so stress free and everyone was so nice i could not believe iti have also downloaded music that i can listen to and have my ear plugs for that i have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that i was shocked
i like getting my monies worth and not having to pay extra monthly feesnow with that said i hope that when you do your research you will consider the nook i am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews
well back to my nook as i can not put it downwhat a great gift and a great buyi got my nook wifig about  months ago and i love it
i researched alot of ereaders before making the decision to buy the nook in fact i originally bought a kindle from a local store but never took it out of the box and returned it to purchase the nooki originally decided to go with the g for two reasons  i wasnt sure i could set up my home wifi to work with the nook and  i wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere
and ive been glad i chose that i have yet to purchase a book over just the wifi
i was at a doctors office recently waiting and waiting and waiting and it was wonderful to be able to shop buy a book and start it while enduring the endless waitingthe customer service from barnes and noble is great all i have to do is walk in the store with my nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the nook
also the store nearest me has classes on saturday afternoons for nooknookcolor owners and i found that to be very helpful when i first purchased my nookspeaking of the physical store i also like that i can read any book for free for up to an hour a day in the store
that gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a free sample and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or notive looked at the newest generation nook which has just recently become available and im glad i got my nook when i did i like it so much better than any ereader ive looked at
i can drop my nook in my purse and anytime im stuck somewhere and want to read ive got a whole library right there with me
the nook is awesomei have been super happy with this reader
in the bright sun sitting outside no problem
on the many flights i take no problem
bn site and downloading books is a breeze
ive got a droid x phone and the accounts sync so i can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the nook app very cooli can lend and have others lend me some of the books purchasedour local library in central texas outside austin is connected to overdrivecom
with my library card i can download epub books and check them out anywhere ive got internet
i dont have to check them back in they just go away after the check out period
same with audiobooks
nook handles this format other ereaders do not so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decisioni like the onscreen keyboardtouch screen personally
it is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen
seems like no big deal but after  hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a differencenot a bunch of keys to hitpress with the keyboard exposed
this is a personal opinion and i can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard
i put in pagemarks etc on books but dont type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading
if you do a lot of this you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it
i dont the amount of typing is very limited so onscreen is perfect and im used to it with my phonesusing this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do but it isnt the best
you can in a pinch but its easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a websitethe number of places to get books especially free ones is awesome with the nook handling so many formats
bn just search  and titles and youll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free
gutenbergorg is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your nook for free google books does this and a few other sites
tons and tons of books for free i havent read tom sawyer in  years and am now for free
just an addition to notelots of periodicals newspapers etc that you can get dailyi take my kids into bn and they love to look through the kids books
while there i can read any book over their wifi for free for up to an hour
i dont use this a lot but once a month or so when i take the kids its pretty cooloverall im really pysched this nook has been awesomehad this for sevral months now and i love it
i love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in colorvery easy to set up account with bn using my nook
it serches for wifi and is very easyanytime i have had any problem a simple reboot fixes iti love the free friday that is offered
i have read sooo many books since i bought iti also think i would like the lend me option if any of my friends had a nookpros eink display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast
reads pdf both scanned and standard text and epub book formats with no hassles or conversion required
instore help and extra features from bn
 page turning speed is much improved with most recent update
android os allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features
replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily
accepts sd cards for increased storage capacity this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp player or for audiobookscons eink display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow
also not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high
ive played with an ipad and its a very fun device
but what i dont like is a glowing backlit screen as i look at a monitor all day
when i read i want to relax and give my eyes a break and thats why i prefer eink displaysthe nooks primary advantage over the kindle is that it allows you to read epub and pdf books scanned or text either works and buy books from various online ebook stores including the sony reader store
this has already allowed me to read two titles that i wouldnt have been able to get for the kindle
it also works very easily with adobe digital editions software a huge plus
currently amazon offers some titles that bn does not a very temporary state of affairs i suspect but those are usually available from sonyadd the book loan feature free library books and the ability to take it to a bn store for bonus features and this unit pretty much stomps the kindle and sony readersthe nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the eink screen but once you get used to it the device seems very smooth
in fact i find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen reading with the nook is a very pleasant experience
i now prefer it to reading books in print to be perfectly honesti have had my nook for a week now and just love it
i find the touchscreen easy to understand and use
i have downloaded books from the local public library using overdrive and adobe digital edition and all have come through perfectly
downloading books from b  n have been quick and efficient
i like being able to findsearch forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily
i have used bookmarks and highlights as well
i also like the feature of being able to go to last read page or to quickly pick a page using the go to
i have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers
the two reasons i chose the nook over the kindle  local support at barnes and noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library
i also easily added my own microsd card and added personal pdf documents to it
i love reading on iti will continue to update this review as i discover new features of the nook so stay tuned folks
updated ive been using my nook with the newest update v  for a few days now
this is the second update to the nook since launch
all i can say is thank you barnes  noblethe lcd screen improvements alone are great
with better looking icons more responsiveness and a sleeker appearance  it makes me think of that mcdonalds commercial im lovin itseveral of the well documented issues have been fixed such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit  which as it turns out was the most cited problem for nook bashers and haters alike
nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized tooallinall if youve been waiting for the minor  issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version
and if you have been considering switching from the kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point
updated this device is clearly the best option on the market today with its lcd touchscreen wifi memory expansion capabilities and so so much more
lets wade in the weeds and look at some of the features in detaillcd touchscreenso far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a lcd screen of any kind
the coverflowlike book cover listing is beautiful elegant and functional
with the newest update it is uber fast intuitive and responsive
page turns are super easy with the touchscreen all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when its in standby mode and the page turns
in addition its easier for me to navigate books via the lcd than textually
seeing the cover is a really nice feature since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover
it just seems like a good cover sells a book and seeing that cover in crisp lcd sells me from time to timethe keyboard is nice any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue
its fast responsive and best of all doesnt look like a s era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the marketwifithe built in wifi is one of the great features of this device
modern g speeds are pretty fast but as most of us know that have smartphones wifi is about  times faster especially when one tries to download large things or a lot of content
the wifi on this device is no exception its fast and super easy to set up
the on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow
i couldnt imagine only having g these days like when you are in an area that doesnt have g coverage you can still use the nook over wifi
this is truly one of the killer features of the nook
you can go into a bn store and wifi to your hearts content but then come home and do the same
hotels offering free wifi are the nooks biachmemory expansionthe nook has a microsd card slot which accepts up to gb microsd cards this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely
another advantage would be to organize your books
and books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies  without having to redownload from the cloud
plus with the new bn desktop reader you can move your books from the nook to a laptopnetbook on the fly and what if the worst should happen and your ereader dies
you still have those books on the cardappearancethis is a biggy for me as it is for most people i dont tend to buy or use things that look ugly
thats why ive got an ipod instead of a zune why ive got a lcd tv instead of a crt and now why ive got a nook instead of another reader
the appearance of this device can be described with one word sexy
it just looks good
other readers currently available range from looking not too bad to looking downright ugly
this reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to bootbook formats and availabilitythis is probably the biggest of all the features since we are talking about a book reader the nook boasts a whopping  books available for it in readily readable format from just two sources bn and google
the nearest competitor only offers  books in its native format kindle
you can convert many books to a kindle readable format but its a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that
sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the pc
and there are third party sources for books in kindle format probably websites youve never heard of new sites pop up all the time since kindle has a big install base but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like googleeink displayit seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there
the ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful
the nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison which for me makes it harder to read
page changes are fast on the nook while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books page its fast enough for the average person
speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though
the controls on the nook are straightforward and intuitivereplacable batterythis is another biggy for most ebook people with the nook you can change the battery out should you a want extended reading times without charge or b if the original battery dies for some reason
many of the other readers on the market do not allow this which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replacedbattery lifea lot has been said about the battery life of the nook and other ereaders
all of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations
i have a coworker with one of the amazon kindle brand ereaders and he has to charge every    days
nook lasts for me about    days but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual real world battery usage
either way all of these devices are easy to charge
just plug into a standard    outlet and presto
or in the case of the nook you can also plug into your computerlaptopnetbook and voila
you will be on go in no time flatease of usethe nook is easy to set up and use the onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setupssummarythere are so many features of this device its hard to capture them all in one review
all in all this is one great device with its ipod like look and feel large number of built in features and industry standard operating system its clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers
updateso i had been told on these comments that the bn in store functionality was not ready to be used yet  another lie dispelled today
i stopped in at the bn in hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional
my nook immediately recognized the bn network and connected without me even having to tell it to
as it turns out there is exclusive content at each bn store at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for free
so seeing one that piqued my interest i naturally downloaded it
wow super fast and convenient and freethe nook is the best ereader yet
it replaces the keyboard on the kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iphone display
this makes it easy to maneuver between  the store your library your current book the daily with messages newsletters and other free content and settings
the lcd display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed and then turns off when readingyou can connect by both wifi and free g to download a purchase in seconds and connect with wifi to get content and other offers when you walk into a bn store
im using the latest  sw release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews
updates are done automatically over the airthe nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip
controls are provided for equal usability by a left or righthander person
the back is removable and replaceable with different colors
they are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop
unlike the kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable
the eink display is the same type but appears to be slightly crisper than the kindle  the nook supports  epub non or adobe drm pdb non drm pdf graphics jpg gif png bmp audio mp pdb
the online bn bookstore has about a million books compared to the kindle store with half that the major difference being the free public domain books provided by googlesummarywhile it costs the same as the kindle the nook is loaded with extra features wifi color lcd removable battery expandable memory more open book formats
you can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook iphone a pc and a macthis is a good item
even though its old its sticks to what an reader should be
it really is good for just reading books
it has great battery and the g works everywherevery happy with the purchase of the nook
wonderful minimalist design lends well to an ereader  its easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback slightly larger yes but certainly not as large as the kindle or the ipad
im tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective  yes we all get electronics that go bad but really cant you talk about the functionality of the device a bit
anyway the device isnt perfect interface not as smooth as the ipad but for the price and functionality its great
i can read ebooks borrowed from my local library have free g service when im out and about and i like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based avoids fingerprints
all in all worth the priceperfect as described thank yougreat product great sale i just love this product and my children will too i want one for myself this is suppose to be their christmas gift but i want one nowits a fine tablet
the screen is excellent
the speakers are very good
the interface is a little clunky but easy to use
it does just what i want it to do and it does it welli couldnt have asked for a better product
i upgraded from the nook color to the hd and i am super happyi had given my kids a nook color a couple years ago
sold it last fall and got  girl a kindle fire nd gen and the other a lenovo a
the lenovo was absolutely horrid so i wanted to replace it
this summer when the nook hd got google play and the prices fell i sold the lenovo and got my daughter the nook hd gb snow
she absolutely loves it
i liked it so much i got the nook hd gb for myself
i like it much better than my kindle fire hd
the size is smaller and thinner and lighter which are great things
and you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it unlike the fire hdi sold the nd gen kindle fire and gave the other daughter the fire hd but she has since switched to a nook also hd
so now i have the fire hd and the nook hd for myself
i like the nook hd better for the reasons stated above
size and weight are so much smaller on the nook hd
the screen resolution is also better
there is nothing i dont like about the nook hd
i did put a greatshield glare screen protector on the nooks to reduce the shiny glare
we use them without cases just sleeves
they are phenomenal tabletsif you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them definitely get the gb nook hd
you will want as much space for apps as you can afford despite the sd card slot
games have to be installed to internal memory for the most part
the sd card slot comes in handy for books movies photos and music
i got the  gb nook hd for myself because i dont play games the only apps i need are for reading playing music news web stuff like that
i put my files on the sd card and i am seti dont plan to buy the new fires when they come out
they are far too limited in my opinion
so was the nook of course until they added google play
i have adw launcher on all three of the nooks though my daughters tend to prefer the standard nook launcher
what shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show
there is also an app drawer icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching
it really is a great design and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the kindle firesi bought this for a friend who studies programming using ebooks while hes at work repairing cars  and he loves itbought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer
she absolutely loves it
its the perfect product for her
the reader portion is excellent
the web graphics are vivid and colorful
it has great functionality for such a small machine and last but not least the price is rightexactly the same as from barnes and noble but less expensive
it has been working great and doing more than i even needed
wow
arrived on time i was a bit worried about the packaging as it came in a bubble envelope in its nook box but everything was fineshe has been using a nook ereader for several years
i decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks
her little smart phone was just too small to use
now shes using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmailthis is a very good tablet for readingsatisfied with my purchasevery handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your handsjust convenient for my needbrand loyalty aside the nook hd and the kindle fire hd are both great products
i have a barnes  noble store about one mile away
i called with some typical learning curve operating questions and was treated with courtesy and competence
my after my poor effort to explain the issues on the phone the local b  n nook expert offered to come in person to help me
took about  minutestry that with amazon
lolnow with google play
an exceptional product with exceptional people backing it upwhen i learned the modifications barnes  noble made to its nooks and saw the price drop i decided to get one formy very active  yearold grandson
he loves it
despite him being a rough  tumble outdoor boy it has held up wellfor a few months now
i attribute this partly to solid quality build and partly to the nook hd  being so thin  lightweighti recommend this tablet especially for children a much better buy than those heavier more expensive  slower tabletssold for childreni had a nook tablet which was fine
saw these at barnes and noble and picked some up for the kids
the difference between the hd and the table is night and day
the screen is amazing
the addition of google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet
it also turns it into a kindle
the kids are busy on all our long car rides
the sd card make it completely expandable
we can watch netflix with wifi or load the sd card with movies for a road trip
its under  bucks too
greati got one of these for christmas and i love it
at first i wasnt all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store but recently they had an update that added all sorts of google apps including google playstore
it has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets
it is great to read with but the books are a little priceynow that it has google playstore and great graphics i cant think of a reason for somebody not to get iti recently bought the nook hd white for  greenbacks from bn
i had originally purchased a kindle fire hd
the nook is lighter and the screen is brightersharper than the kindle fire
with the recent update to allow the full version of google play a lot of the original limitations with the nook have gone away
the chrome browser beats silk all the way
you can actually download the kindle app from the google appstore and read all the books
however you cannot install the amazon appstore and i had to buy some of the apps from google play that i had originally purchased
there are no ads with the nook
even with the fathers day sale which put the kindle noad version at  this is cheaper by  bucks
an additional benefit is you can add an external sd card and there are options to boot a full blown standard android jellybean from the sd card with the nook from places like afn  android for nook for just  bucksthe two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera but i really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the kindle you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered but i have not fully figured it outi liked it so much that i bought a second nook in smoke color todayjust want you to know that i did not get this tablet from amazon got it from walmart but i must say that the tablet is great
i searched it on amazon but because it was near xmas i went to walmart and bought one so as to ensure i would have it by xmas
the nook tablet looks and works just fine was a gift for my granddaughteri cant say enough good things about this tablet i love it
first off the screen is beautifulits vivid and the colors are greatthe best for the price no doubt
its even nicer than the nexus  screentablet performance is good for a dual core tabletand the gpu is a good one sgx same as some of the ipads so games run pretty wellweight ergonomics and screen size are just rightthe quality of this tablet is excellent
it also has bluetooth which manny tablets dont have in this price rangepersonally i love the ui barnes and noble put on this table its nice
and now with google play you have a gazillion apps to choose frombattery life is also pretty good and wifi works wellthe tablet has  speakers and there decent pretty loud which is nicei got mine on sale for  is worth every penny
i guess the only minor thing i found was it gets a little warm at times but thats typical of manny tablets and phonesmy daughter bought these for her children through me
they love them
i would recommend them to everyone that likes this kind of stuffa year after barnes and noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the nook hd  is still one of the best values in the tablet market
the price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale but dont wait too long because they are no longer being manufacturedthere are two primary reasons that i like the nook hd 
first of course is the  x  high resolution display
you will note that  by comparison p is only  x  so this display is x not x
in my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode
the second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released rom builds with the latest version of android kitkat
these can be used either by flashing the tablets rom internally or running kitkat from a micro sd card and leaving the nooks original operating system untouchedwe have numerous android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free but their are companies who sell micro sd cards already set up for around 
so for a reasonable price one can get a rooted android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warrantythis tablet was originally released in november of   it has a  ghz omap dualcore processor which is a little slower than the samsung exynos  dualcore ghz processor found in the galaxy tab   that was released in a few months later in mid   the processor is good enough to play most formats of hd video but struggles with games with d graphics
it performs better with the rooted version of kitkat than with the stock nook oswe had a galaxy tab   and now have a galaxy tab  
they both have a very good gps and cameras in the front and rear
the nook has neither of these features
but the bigger display with x resolution as compared to x on the galaxy tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet formany of these were sold so there is a very good support network
lots of accessories are available through amazon and the other usual suspects
the hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here
they come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available
i am giving it  stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale it is the best tablet value that i am currently aware ofive bought a few nooks over the years and have always loaded cyanogenmod plain android off an sd card and a few times on the actual devicethe hd is no exception
as long as you understand that it doesnt have a camera its powerful and inexpensive
it even comes with google play
east your hear out kindle usersup for your own project
head over to the xda developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of android either right on the device or run it off a microsd cardgreat screen fast processor
this thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and android oswell i bought it because of the p resolution
the screen quality is beautiful
i already have an apple th generation ipad but i couldnt resist on the high quality picture and low price
after i received the nook i immediately rooted with kit kat the latest operating system
let me tell you i am glad that i made the move
the original ice cream sandwich os has lag but not kit kat
with kit kat not only the nook operates much more smoothly you also get the full android tablet experience and more apps available from google playi recently stumbled across the xbmc cine player android app in the google play store
with this app i can now stream over  movies in hd quality for free
i have been using xbmc for a little while now on both macbook pro and raspberry pi though the cine player versions library is not as extensive as the macbook pro and raspberry pi it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something
with kit kat i experience very little buffering issue
i can also output contents to a tv via the nook hdmi adapter
i believe you can output signal to a tv via google chromecast but i havent tried it yet so i cant be for surei highly recommend the nook if you root it with the latest os
i am finding more and more things that i can do with the nook then the ipad due to android is an open systemby the way i use na to root my two nook hds
with a na micro sd card it gives you the dual boot capabilities
you can use it to boot kit kat or the native barnes and noble os without removing the card
the na card doesnt replace the native os as the kit kat os is stored in the micro sd card so you dont have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet osbottom line the nook hd is already a pretty decent tablet
one can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the os
if front and back cameras and gps are not necessities for you the nook is a good value tablet for  of the cost of an ipad
by the way i bought an external bluetooth gps for  and it works like a charm with the nook
one can expect to spend  for an external bluetooth gps if your ios device doesnt come with an internal gpsmy husband had one and i got this one for christmas
it keeps all my books and crafting patterns in one placereview for barnes  noble nook hda new winner in the best value in a midsize android tablet categorywhen it was originally introduced at around  it was a decent value in a midhi range tablet but limited by the closed bn ecosystem
now that it is being offered at new prices  and has been upgraded to support google play android apps as well as bn content the value proposition is much improved
yes you will have to be patient and let your nook hd do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy
but its worth the wait
if you are coming from other nook devices youll feel right at home
if not you may be surprised to find the combined reader and android tablet interface pretty nice
its well thought out and for the most part works very well
take your time and be willing to explore a bit and youll soon get the hang if  it
dont miss the nook today icon which is a clever one but easily overlooked
all in all i was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the ui a bit of a refreshing change
occasionally you have to use the home key instead of just back but a minor quibble
note you can override the nook ui and install other launchers but i personally felt no need to do so
but nice to know the option is there if ever needed
the size is a nice compromise between the smaller units too small for comfortable long video watching and the larger units big heavy bulky
the  range seems to be the sweet spot
the full hd x ppi screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness
videosmovies youtube photos graphics all look great
the high quality screen is the big draw here in my opinion
excellent value at the new price pointthe size weight very light for this size device slimness and easy handling are all good points of this tablet
some do not like the nook hole on the bottom left but i am fine with it
it gives a bit of orientation an easy place to grab the tablet and so on
the styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handlehd youtube and netflix look wonderful
this is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch netflix on the go
i was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems so the movies sounded great as well
bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones of course
the built in speakers is ok but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality as is true with most tabletsthe controls are well placed simple and easy to use
the microsd card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets
the proprietary charging port is a minus a standard usb would have been more flexible but it works well and charges faster
the handy home button with the nook logo is very useful and also works wellthere are no cameras  and i could care less but some might
ill take the superb screen great design and build and other nice features and be happy
for the techies it uses  ghz dualcore omap  proc and  gb of ram
not cutting edge but plenty fast
benchmarks i checked were all pretty good and the nook hd is very responsive in use
the back features a nice soft touch feel that i really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily droppedthe recent update adds the chrome browser to the nook hd and web browsing is snappy and works well
everything looks great of course on the full hd screen and the chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb formatting them nicely for the nook hd
chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices automatically which is niceif you like barnes  noble and their books and movie content then of course that is a win for you as well
its all here and well integrated
plus there are some nook hd specific apps preinstalled and you should prefer them in most cases
note i made the mistake of updating the nook netflix app with the one from the google play store  big nono
it did not work at all
once i uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the nookbranded version from the nook store free  everything worked fine again
ive had this issue with other tablets as well the netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet
i had also installed the android pandora over the nook version but that one worked fine
soif you do this and have issues just uninstall and reinstall from nook storecloud vs google play store and youll be fine
all of the other android apps from google play that i tried have worked fine
pandora stitcher internet radio maps amazon mp amazon kindle wow
a bit of a surprise
 gmail youtube etc
all work as expected
the new openness of the nook hd is a game changer for the nook line and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinioni bought mine at the local bn store and theres a lot of help available there if you need it which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally
very friendly staff and great customer service what a novel concept
the nook hd is a sleeper  an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value being available currently at very attractive prices
a  star item for features design performance and valuei bought this tablet for someone as a gift
i was so confused about which one i should get them
i definitely chose correctly for themi cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good great nook hd that is keeping me very happy
i have been truly blessed this nook tablet is the best
i am watching movies on it via hulu and netflix and other apps for movies etc
the video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoorsi do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there this tablet is sufficient to my needs
there is no camera if you need one get another type of tablet
i recommend for those who do not need a super tablet however this tablet can do a lot
i just have not tried it all yet
i will  again say this the video playback to me is awesomeit is truly hd
i am very satisfied with my refurbished nook hd ii am getting a lot for very little
i recommend buying thnook for a few dollars worth a  lot of funthis is good product compared to its price
im using it for watching video writing documents and web searching
its perfect for my needs and i upload cm  so now im using it with android its so goodbrand new condition
fast shipping
this tablet is the best deal on a  size that you can get
way better than what the same size cost in my last husbandeasy to use lots of storage for apps even the large ones
plus will hold additional scancard
beats the kindle sorry amazon by a mile in functionality weight and pricegot this for my nook since bn didnt have it
good price and exactly what i needed
it also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nookthe original chargers i had for the nooks were dying as in literally falling apart after a couple years
hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long if not longerthis is the third adapter that i have tried other than buying direct from bn
this adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device
it is better made than the original
great valueworks as described  owned  years now and works well no complaints here
great product at an excellent pricesince its a cable for digital data shielding isnt a big issue with hdmi
use it for my satellite boxes for i hd plus audio
no problemsonly had it for a few weeks but have not noticed one problem for this price compared to other hdmi cables i feel like i won big on this itemits not top of the line by any means but certainly a good value for the pricei bought this cable to hook up an apple tv
save your money on the expensive cable and buy this oneworks greatthis item does exactly what it says it will do  and at a good price
if i had a complaint it was that i did not purchase a longer one for what i need it for
of course this is more of my fault versus the productbut if the length works for you and you need a hdmi cable this will fill the job and do it very wellwire is heavy grade but as with all cables you cant really tell how strong the connectors are till they breakitem was as described in post
simple and just what i needed
great price too
actually bought two
good valuewith amazon prime these things are only 
they arrived so quickly just in time for me to hookup my computer and other entertainment systems into my new tv
theyre fantasticthis cable works as advertised
no need to spend more for an hdmi cable
there is no difference in picture quality between this cable and brands costing much much morethey are inexpensive and they get the job done
im glad i got them
i use them with my wdtv at worklove em and if i lose them ill just buy another set or gold is good
makes the best quality connections for data trans
length is more than adequate ft as length can attenuate diminish the quality of signals
also sheathing to reduceilluminate crosstalk or interference both in and out of the cable
used to connect bluray player wifi to  inch plasma tv wo a hitch
amazon cables are just as good
i think they all come from china
the thickness of the wire and the gold plate are both factors in quality data links
like the size of a hose for water and how much pressure it will endurewith free shipping you cant go wrong and they are guaranteed
it took about three weeks for deliveryi dont have too much exciting to say about the cable
im not a videophile by any means but the cable works i dont see any problems with it and it is a bunch cheaper than i could get from best buya cable is a cable
its going to work  of the time no matter where you buy it
but amazon always has the best pricesthis cable works fantastic and i didnt have to pay  for it
i highly recommend
so glad i gave a cheap price hdmi a shotthe price was right and i cannot discern a difference between this cable and a higher priced cable i have in my possession
maybe ill see a difference when i upgrade to k productsbought this to replace a   foot cable bought from target which would cause picture glitches and dropouts regularly  this one works flawlessly is twice as long and a fraction of the pricepurchased this a few years ago and forgot to write a review
needless to say im still using it and have no problems
i purchased this back when the cheapest hdmi cord was 
great buy i recommend itbrought back my ipod video g back life easy to replace
only hard part is to get the case openedawesome replacement for an ipod video th gen gb hard drive saved me the cost of buying a brand new ipodthis article with all my expectations fulfilled recommend it because the packaging and jurisdiction entrag correct in addition to run ferfeciona very easy replacement for a th gen ipod g hd
i purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged
it had the sad ipod face screen of death
i could hear the hd trying to spin up but not reading properly
if you have that indication all you need is this hdthe repair was easy
carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector
the ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open
next remove the bad hd by unplugging the ribbon cable on the hd side
make sure to note the orientation of the hd as it will only work one wayeasy to put the replacement hd in backwards
replace with the new hd
the only trouble i had was the cable would not stay in the hd for some reason
i had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the hd so it wouldnt come out
next using a small pair of needlenose pliers grip the small ribbon cable gently and push it back into its slot
finally carefully hold the hd in place and reattach the two ipod piecesnow you will have to restore to factory settings
there are resources on the net for thisi just started up itunes and plugged in the ipod
after a few min
itunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restoredgood luckmy ipod video had hard drive failure
i used ifixit instructions and this drive to make it workmake sure you plug the cable in the right way
drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully
if you get it wrong ipod will tell you there is battery failure but there isnt its just the drive in backwards
i flipped it around and it worked no harm donenot much to say
dropped right into my zune in place of the original drivethe cable release tab is extremely fragile but the drive works just fine even though i broke the tab oopsmy daughters gb ipod classic needed a new hard drive and this worked greatabout  minutes to install plug in to itunes and it set up by itselfmoney wellspent
i love this little speakermicrophone
the sounds is very clear
volume buttons work great and the microphone is great
i love this itemi love this produtct
echo canceling is working perfectry
it is avairable for room meeting
mm headphone jacki bought it totaly more than  and i will buy more for my friendsthis movie was playing at radio city music hall back in the days of the moviestage show formt
it was also presented in mm on that huge radio city screen
i remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more
wowwhat a great movieive seen many versions of quottom sawyerquot but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen
maybe because its a musical
whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by its gradure and scope
a must for ever american kid and adult too
this is as red white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made
hehe  buy it before some group puts a ban on it
which should want you to buy this for the kids even more
they dont make them like this anymorethis is a wellmade and wellacted musical version of the tom sawyer story
it does not follow the book exactly but the substance is there
charming performances by then child actors johnny whitaker tom and jodie foster becky thatcher and academyawardwinner celeste holm as aunt polly
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
i rented it for my granddaughters school project and wound up watching it  times
it took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly worldhighly recommendedthis fits my  kindle fire hd perfectly
i love it
it even has a slot for a stylus
the kindle is velcroed in so its nice and secure
very glad i bought thisi love this case fits my kindle perfectly the only thing i dont like is that the power button is not visable in the case other than a great caseits her favorite color and it protects her kindle
she has no complaints
covers the power button but not a big deali just received this today
i love it
i have one similar for my kindle fire hd and i love the sleep and awake featuregreat case especially for the price point
my daughters favorite color so she loves it too
bought the matching stylusworked great for what  i needed it for and was small toovery compact and no problems with baud rates up to k
couldnt be happier with this adapter
i highly recommend keeping this and the various related adapters to anyone who needs to interface with network equipmentthis works as a null modem cable just as advertisedthis low profile connector is working perfect in combination with my usb rs cablenice construction and nice labeling so you dont use it for the wrong thing
it does the job and for only three bucks you cant go wrongit is not very often that i can get something cheap fast and that performs as it should
this is one such item
the hardware seems to be durable it is very compact and it performs the simple null modem taski have been using this alot converting old video tapes vhs and tv into online videos
anything you can play on your vcr from tapes or tv it can recordat the time i bought this cover the kindle had just come out
st generation it served its purpose  but since then there have been so many new cover in types and stylesi have read many reviews on folio cases for ipad
you will find the best ever in most of reviews that have got over four stars
so i wont say the cliche but want to say that i am very satisfied
although i love my ipad id felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful
then i bumped into this case
what a wonderful idea to put moleskine with ipadsomeone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick and it is true
i feel like i am holding a book
however it makes me feel that my ipad is well protected
the quality of paper is good as always and it is very easy to flip over
also it also has the rubber band
since i dont have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not but the skin feels smooth and softi am a gamer and a coder
this monitor is great for both
although i would like it a bit more with hdmi it performs beautifully from my gtx  gb dvidsince the resolution is great at  you can view magazine like hbr or scientific america in dual page with crystal clear flicker free
you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous dell  inch
the brightness and ips performance so stunning
for thailand friend they send direct to your home and pay custom for  b then this monitor is much cheaper than any  inch with same resolution selling in thailanddrpoonchaibangkok thailandmuch better than the p qnix and destroys all pthis puts all the  hz stuff to bed
unless you play seriously competitively and you probably do not then p ips absolutely destroys  monitors with much higher refresh rates
those are ok monitors and just fine but if you have the horsepower r  or x  or ti can definitely max this baby other slightly lower cards still work very well as well as crossfire and sli get thisno dead pixels gorgeous screen and a really good stand
straight monitor with no bs features
it turns on
its a boss
it turns offheres what you want to knowthe stand is fine
there are only  working buttons on this
this is the power button a brightness buttons and volume buttons
there is no other screens setups no calibrations etc
all of that has to be done on your pc connected to this
it is literally a straight monitor
as advertised not  dead pixelresolutions excellentthere is a powerbrick with this item just an fyi
havent had any issues with itto mount the monitor on the monitor mount put the backend on first then put the big base on the  feet screw them in recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it
the dvi connector is a good lengthid recommend it
went from a dual monitors at x  inch to this beast
night and day
i can have two documents up side by side with room to spare my girl reviews allot of documents and she was liking this hunking thing too
it is a large monitor comparable to a  inch tvyes the instructions are in korean who cares
the box has the whole sparta theme on it dont care either
it is a good monitor good response time awesome resolutioni would do this monitor at x vs a k monitor for  reasons k monitors are 
yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because most k monitors run at hz
basically it means that the monitor can only display hz
this monitor displays at  hz which is fantastic
to clarify essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second
now you can have a k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at  fps your monitor will only support  fps of it its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter and you want at least  if not more k monitors may require more than  connection aka  dvi port connections to run well k is still reaaaaly new
there working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming k monitor that isnt over this is a  inch monitor well under the  to  pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this oneto the gamers out there loaded up counter strike awesomenauts eve online all ran at this resolution full screen no barsthis is the best thing i have ever bought get a wireless signal is the easiest using the device is the best and overall this is the best thing i have boughtnever had one of these before and i love mine
limit as far as performancecant take an sd card bigger than g no sdhc cards and only runs windows mobile  se
still works great for what it does
can connect via b to just about any hotspot available and plenty of apps still floating around the net for windows mobile  but if you have the money as i didnt i would suggest the axim x the last of the axim series dell madei bought this to go with my new acer aspire one
i also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small
this one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be
fast service from the seller with several preand postshipping alerts from the seller too
a real pleasuretengo una mini y no tiene unidad de disco este producto ha sido de muchisima utilidad para la reproduccioacuten y grabacion en cdsi bought this drive to go with my netbook since netbooks are too small for a drive with removable media
i based my decision on size price and the fact that you do not need to use two usb cables to power this up
this plays cds and dvds as well as any internal drive in a laptop
i can watch movies play music and install software
no big deal to pack it with the netbook and take it with you
excellent product would highly recommedi have had this for a couple months
used it to load win on a acer netbook
worked just greati have a   in
computer with no disk drive and i needed to get my computer updated as much as possible
this is working wonders and i am slowly cleaning my computer off of the old stuff and putting on new or updated programsi had no problem with my red dvdcd player
i pluged it in and worked immediately in my three laptops
i have a ten year old hp laptop that i dont use much but i pluged the external usb in it just to see if it would work on an old one and it worked fine
i bought this dvdcd player to use with a netbook that i bought but it has not arrived yet so i can not tell if it will work in the netbook
if i have any problems with it i will update this review later oni must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low pricei needed a cddvd player to install programs to my new netbook
installation was easy just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediatelyi upload microsoft professional office  quickly and easily
it does play movies i played my harry potter movie with no problems
the vlc media player was already installed
i highly recommend this playerthis goes great with my acer netbook
i use it a lot to import things from other computers
it makes things so much more convenientworks as advertised
i needed a replacement for the internal drive on my lenovo y which had failed
since the failure on the internal drive had happened before i didnt want to deal with that again
having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the os had been loaded on it an internal drive would be rarely neededi use this thing way more than i thought i ever would
great little product can be a pain if your usb ports are to close togetheri bought the blue one for my sons blue toshiba netbook and it matches exactly
it arrived with two cables and instructions but i only needed the usb cable
i plugged it in the driver software loaded and it worked
its small and quiet and works perfectly for a great pricethis external drive has helped me a lot it comes in handy when your mac notebook or netbook cddvd drive is not workingi had a small notebook computer which had no internal dvdcd drive so i purchased this
i have used it to run and install countless programs and not once has it ever given me trouble
i have also installed and played many games and it has a fast read speed and gets the job done in a timely fashion i highly recommendi have purchased a small laptop netbook type for use as a large tablet
it has a touch screen and windows  installed
however it does not have an optical drive too small of a footprint
to load some of my favorite programs requires a cddvd drive
this unit meets that need very nicely
it is effective quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one usb cablethere are times that a dvd drive is essential such as installing office this does the job throught the usb connectioni bought this external usb for my netbook and it works great for downloading programs
in fact ive been lending out to other family members
no complaints hereit works fine to play dvds
havent used it in other applications yet
as others have said you have to download a media player if you have windows   i used vlc media free downloadthe description didnt say what brand the dvd drive was so i assumed i would be getting a cheap chinese generic drive
however when i opened the package it was a brand new lg drive
i was very thrilled to get that for only 
the drive is very thin and made of aluminum
the drive features a slidetray and works decently
i used it to install microsoft office  and star wars battlefront ii on my asus tmt tablet pc without any issues
plus lg is a namebrand you can trust
i highly recommend this dvd drive as you get the best bang for you buckpros full system in a small casecons having t use  usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawbackoverall a good external systemi purchased this player for my  year old daughters acer aspire one netbook de for her to play dvds games and to load norton  on the netbook
item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from amazon simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box
there were no receipts etc for the shipment and only a small booklet for installation on older windows os systems
the booklet did mention that the unit is a cddvd burner but required additional software to do so i checked on my acer  laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check it is only a dvdcd player
it also came with a usb driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation and two usb plugs one for media and one for power
simple to figure out though just plug in both usb plugs and windows  starter did the rest
however like others with windows  starter i had to download vlc media player to play dvds
no problem there except for the additional junk that came with the media player download which i immediately deleted
the cddvd player works great now and sounds especially awesome on earbuds
i have a windows anytime upgrade from starter to full home version ready to install but i may return it now that i have this dvdcd rom working and the free desktop download correction fixedcons  i was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a dvdcd burner
that is not a real major setback since this is for a  yr olds netbook but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner
one for all and all for one i saypros  easy  i mean easy setup
also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both usb cables just plug in the media plug to the usb  and that is all required
great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my acer one netbook model
free shipping
case seems to be sturdy enough just dont pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing
region settings available so it plays most everything
great dvd picture on both my acer laptop and the acer aspire one netbook very pleasedoverall  i would recommend this to anyone needing a dvdcd rom for the acer aspire one netbook  provided you do not want a unit for burning cds and dvdsupdate  march   the more i use this player the more i like it
the picture on my daughters acer aspire one netbook is sharper than the one on my acer laptop with widescreen hd
if you are an acer netbook lover this is the external player for you
just a reminder it is not a dvdcd burnerfinal update   i finally upgraded my daughters acer one netbook from windows starter to windows  and the new os picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc
i also upgraded to gb memory see my other reviews which took all of about  minutes to accomplish
my daughter is playing video games and watching dvd movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow
i am amazed that this player has performed as it has
total thumbs up for quality and performance
i upgraded to  stars simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far
for the price you simply cannot go wrongthis usb dvdcd external drive works like a charm
very simple to set up have been using it with my imac that does not have an internal disk drive
computer recognized it immediately
the drive is very light and portablei use cra batteries like candy i didnt know they were rechargeable till a colleague of mine happened to have a set
i quickly got on amazon and found this kit which has been a life saver
the ability to charge them either from a  wall outlet or a v car charger is invaluable particularly if travel between countriesvery powerful batteries use it a lot and doesnt have to care about spare batteries great price for the packagethese batteries are good and so is the charger
for my husbands police small flashlight this is great especially the car chargerthis is a great kit everything works as it should
fast service from the seller
didnt realize there was a car plug adapter included this will come in handyif you are like us and you have tactical flashlites and night lights on your firearms you know it is no fun to pay  for  to  hours of light
these pay for themselves in no time at allwith that said i will repost if they fail early or quit retaining full charge
so far we have about  charges and recharges
we have had them for about  monthsi needed a replacement battery for a davis weather station which uses solar cells to power the remote sensors
after finding out that nonrechargeable batteries only lasted  weeks the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell wont do much for a nonrechargeable battery
i bought this product and am very happy with it
my weather station is happy again the charger itself which ive only used for the initial charge worked quickly and without a hitch
the product design is pleasant and fool proof
im a satisfied customerthe batteries work and the recharger recharges
you cannot ask for more so this product has my blessing
it was also a great buy and saved me some coin so it really has my blessing
thanks for providing a great product at a great priceoriginal these batteries have been excellent for my flashlight and work four about  hours on full power
not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mineupdate   these batteries are still running as strong as they were when i purchased them so i have increased my rating from  to  stars
they work great in my work light fenix tk which is a highly demanding power consuming unit
i completely recommend these for anyone who is a leo ems or similar line of worki bought some of these to try with a light using  as
they work as advertised
when you check them with a meter they show over  volts but under load they do not hurt the light
have been using them for a while now
hold a charge very well and no longer have to buy throw away asi bought these for use in my flashlights steripen adventurer and msr miox
the chargers work better than the solar counterparts but any use overseas you better take the solar chargers
still they arrived quickly and have worked well every timethe charger took about  hours to give two rca v mah rechargeable liion protected batteries a charge of 
so for  batterys figure  hours
i only use one at a time so thats roughly four nights on my nodadditional information  i used it by doing a direct plugin to my solar charger and it powered up two rca batteries to  charge in an  hour sunrise till sunset daythe link for the amanzon solar charger is  httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbhsgrefcmcrrypsolprdtitlesfthis is exactly what i needed for my su wireless flash commander
it sure beats buying these batteries as often as i was
i definitely recommend itgot one for home and one for the car
work great but sometimes dont last as long as the nonrechargeable versions
great for training days for my tactical lights as i can use one up and grab another from the chargerimagine that you dont have to worry that you forgot to turn your flash off or it got flipped on in your camera bag
imagine you never have to worry that your battery will die on youand it came fast in great packagaingthankscharges quickly
very good set for the price
will review more when field tested
using it for my tactical flashlight used for le worki bought this for my ipod g
i wanted to take advantage of skype calling my family
the mic itself is small about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who dont know that a horse pill is any big a pill you try to swallowlol i have a little pouch in my purse i keep it in so i dont lose itbecause you will lose it
the sound was good when i recorded a voice memo
but you have to remove it to hear anything back
thats the kickerits a restriction of the device not the mic
i thought i could use the mic to speak and my bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time
no such luck
you have to get the ipod headphones with built in micrecorder to do that
so all i can use this for is to record stuff and listen later
but it was cheap so its still a cool addition to my toys
oh and i also got the ipod headphones with mic those too live in my little pouch of goodieslolthis little microphone transforms my ipod into something much more useful for recording events
there is no way to listen at the same time but that was advertised as such
thank youi just got my mini mic and my chill pill rapcap in the mail todayi bought both for my ipod class gig for recording lectures
i didnt want to get one at a time to compare so i just bought both
my mini mic cost me  and just under  shipping and rapcap was  and free shippingi compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound
turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic
also the rapcap is about mm smaller in diameter but same size in length
the caps construction is identical
both work identical
everything is the same
the only thing to test is durability but im confident it will be the sameso save the money and buy this one over the rapcap
they pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about  feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine
i have a flip open case so i can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound greatonly complaint i have is that i bought the rapcap toowhen i wanted to use my ipod to record some reminders to myself i looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay  to  or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study but then i found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me just plug it in and go
i wish all tech stuff could be this easywe received our order in three days which was super fast
the microphone that we received is actually white but that is not an issue for us
we put it on our  year old ipod touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games
despite reviews that stated it didnt work because the ipod thinks there are headphones in we have not had that issue with any of our talking games  with the exception of the talking angela game
i put the mic in and rebooted the ipod and it worked perfectly
i thought perhaps i would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either
i was actually ready to take my ipod to the apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this  dollar microphone was the answer for usthis products work for what i was using it for an old ipod touch
im pleased but this is very easy to losei bought my mic from crazyfrog not expecting that great of a mic due to the price
it shipped very fast and i recieved it in perfect condition
it works just as well as if not better than my mic that came with an iphone
it works great with my ipod touch nd generation mc model
i would strongly advise anyone to buy this whos looking for a high quality mic at a low price
dont let those bad reviews scare you
i dont know about the quality from other sellers but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition
great buyi gave this five stars because for the price this tiny microphone is excellent
i needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my rd generation ipod touch
i can report that this mic works perfectlyif you need fancy cut offs filters or you expect concert quality results please go elsewhere
if you want something that works well for much less than  get this mic or get a couple of themthis mic sounds surprisingly great
it picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely
my only complaint is that it is easy to lose but theres nothing the manufacturer could do about thati purchased from hourdispatchglobal and it arrived quickly
the microphone was readily accepted by my ipod touch g and allows me to make voice memos
i also tried it for a skype call and it works
note other reviewers have noted you cant both have it in the ipod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers  this is a limitation of the ipod touch and i refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the ipod touch like so many others have
you can use it to make a skype call and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to speaker either when making or receiving a call
its about the size of a very large pill
im very pleased with the seller and the itemsmall compact easy to carry around
followed the instructions and it worked perfectly
its not a broadcast quality microphone but for everyday voice use its a great portable solutionwhen i bought my itouch a few years back i didnt like the fact that it had no mic
so i started doing some searching here on amazoncom and i found one and still have it today
i was able to ptt  press to talk like a walkie talkie and other stuff
i like itit works perfect
the only thing is it is so small
lol
like i think i have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device
good item
would recomend to anyonei love this mic it works on itouch generation  gb so well
i love it too much and wat a money saver too 
nothing more to say but to order it soonreceived this item today
plugged it in and thought that i should have read the reviews first
but there were also alot of good reviews
so i tried to think what was going on plugging it in first it said no microphone when i went to my recording app
i dont know if it did not go in all the way with the case on my ipod but i had to charge it and when i tried again with the case off it did work
in order to listen to what you have recorded you have to disconnect the microphone
made sure it was pushed in all the way when i put the case back onthis is a very good seller
the product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival
the only problem i have is that the mic has no speakers so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod againi needed this for my ipod touch and also ordered a few extras because i lose little things easily
this mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than i was expecting it to be
ive even recommended this to a couple of friendsgood product does the job
good price
it has a carrying case
i used for the ipod  does a good jobthis is a fantastic tool if you are recording anything from business meetings you can even use it for the app shazam it really cool
not for use for the voip thoughi use this product all the time since i am on voxer
i needed a microphone and this product is great because it is small and not as noticeable
i really love itsd ultra micro sdxc card has worked without flaw so far
its been troublefree up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files gb from my hp laptop to my samsung note   edition
ive also purchased compatible sd micro cards for my samsung galaxy iii cell phones which have worked out better than the kingston cards that i had originally purchasedworks as described
have not had an issue with my samsung galaxy note   there was a surprise when it arrived though there was an sd adapter card with it
did not read that in the description when i ordered the cardthis product does not deserve the  stars the other reviewers gave it
one reviewer got the wrong product apparently which has to do with the seller while the other doesnt seem to realize that the usb port is for charging peripherals not a computerproshas basically all plug adapters you need builtin or easily removablecompactsturdy good quality plastic kind of like legodecent usb power port rated at malights for ac power and usb powerconsdoes not groundinstructions say vv but unit says v
should work in japan but havent tested itnotesdo not pay full price at a retailer for this item
i got mine from the seller in this listing
it was delivered in a simple bubbleenvelope with instruction sheet no maimshell packaging
i love the lights on this thing
you can plug in and know right away if there is ac
furthermore the usb lights up depending on the current being drawn and thus flickers when something is tricklecharging
know what this means
it means you can tell at a glance if your device is  charged
do not topoff your batterypowered devices to 
the memory effect is a myth
the real culprit is toppingoff your battery
charge your devices until the usb flickers and then remove them
keep in mind that as with all modern plug converters your primary device must be rated to use v mains power
this adapter will not stepup or stepdown voltage unnecessary with modern electronicsthe only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra usb port or if it was somehow rotatablethis thing kicks ass and is a great bargain compared to the other namebrand junk out there that is either overpriced or overpriced and doesnt have usb powerthese are great the usb port is especially handy
small size and all the adapters i could want
at first it seemed to light to do its job but it is working great
it is the only adapter that i use when travellingthis is very handy and it charges two things at once easily
i usually charge my laptop and ipod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far
it also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself which is very handy because you dont have to remember where you put the eu plug or the us plug etcthese were a lifesaver
i bought  of these and i was a little unsure of the quality based on the price of this item but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked for me over  weeks in europe and uk
stayed in over  hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem
i travel with a cpap breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so i could sleep
i also had an iphone and my brother had an ipad and the usb charger was great for both
i could also use one plug to both power the cpap and charge the iphone
it was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in europe and uk have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet
also on the train the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasnt working
i worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on
that was quite a time saver and great tool for that purposethe only negative i have is that the part that holds the us plug into the device could be a little more snug
it felt like it was going to fall out at times and did fallout  times but that wasnt much over  weeks of usethere is one design enhancement that i would have put into this device when using the uk converter they could have made the bottom of the device a nd  outlet so that you would have   outlets the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the euro converter as well as the usb outlet
of course this may be over the amperage that one plug should carry but its a thought for the designerswe are heading to europe this summer
of course well have an array of electronic devices with us camera kindle phones etc
and i wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up
this is a perfect solution at a very affordable priceonce upon a time i travelled with a heavy current converter and a handful of plugs to fit a variety of sockets outside the us all in a bulky case
now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter and this one fits the bill
its very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit  no more lost parts
 and it has the added benefit of a usb port for charging mp players  the like
add to that a superreasonable price and i dont know how you could ask for moreit is good and as expected
i love to have it with me for my international traveli love itthis adapter is a very good investment
ive used this in europe korea ethiopia africaand the uk and it has not missed a beat
i really like the extra usb plugs
they work so well that i no longer carry an extra ac to usb adapter
it does have an internal fuse that cannot be replaced but i have yet to encounter a problemi plan to get another onenote this is only an adapter not a voltage converter
most outlets outside of the usa are  so be sure what you plug in is duel voltage
most cell phone chargers and laptops are duel voltageedit ive uploaded some pictures please feel free to viewwe have two of these and recently used them in both ireland and sweden
it includes plugs for uk us european and australian style plugs
contrary to what one other reviewer says here it does really support australian plugs
to use it on an australian outlet with the angled slots just twist the blades of the us plugthe fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it
i have removed the fuse and ordered replacements
when i get it working again ill post an update
it is marked as a  a  v fast blowing fuse which means that this is rated for about  w thats about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question but its more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carrythe red indicator leds are helpful to know that its working but they are fairly bright so if bright leds in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping plan ahead to cover them up with somethingupdate i replaced the blown fuse with one of thesequality usa brand fuses
set of  pieces agav falv fa v f lv fa v flv cartridge glass fuses xmm  in x  in  a v fastblow fast acting
everything appears to be working fine and i now have  spares to take with me on my next tripim in europe right now using this and it hasnt let me down
i use it every morning to heat water with a immersion heater i insert in my coffee mug to make coffee each day
at other times i use it to charge my kindle backup batteries camera and cellphonei wish i had purchased  so i can use more than one outlet at a time
i did bring along an extension cord but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate
using  outlets is more efficient
im buying an additional one for my next triphighly recommend this one as it is very versatile with the usb porttheres not much to say other than that the price was exceptional
the adapter set is compact and appears durable
i really wanted the usb charger plug and figured i might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargainthis is a cable
it allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my nexus   it functions exactly as advertisedcord worked great for awhile but had recently not been working up to snuff
cant understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months
it should last a lot longer than that
wont keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station
switched back to the oem cable and what do you know
its charging againdefinitely going to have to find a different cableedit  nope the cable is fine
it works great as an otg cablei was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone as well as add files to my nexus  it was actually the cheaplymade  chinese charger i had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad
when i put this cable on my nexus oem charger it worked just fine
i do believe ill be purchasing another nexus  oem charger in the near futurea big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device liked it so much i am going to buy several morebecause i take my nexus everywhereperfect additional memory for my samsung galaxy  smart phone
easy to install and transfer data
could have not asked for anything bettershe put it in her samsung galaxy  phone to be able to hold more pictures and data and hopefully not lose it if she breaks her phone againnow so far ive only tested it out on a computer as my tablet has still not arrivedshipped out a week ago
so i will update when i get to test it out on the tablet as well
it works great a bit slow in transfer items from my computer but thats to be expected on my old laptop so no problems there either
 gb only  can be used on mine but that is still more than enough space for me since i only plan on storing apps and ebooks on it along with a few moviesmaybe
will look to buy this again if i need more room or if my mom needs oneupdate received tablet today and popped this in works great reads really fast
great for holding my books movies and apps that i dont want taking space on the tabletmy last memory card for my galaxy s got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessiblegot deleted
i needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it
ive had this microsd card for a few months now and it has been great
i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data especially photos on the galaxy si bought this for my sons gopro and its worked out great
i just wish i would have bought the gb instead of going cheap on the gb but so far so good
hes a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issuespurchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a gig
got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare amazon first
haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait
was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store pricethis card is very good
i use it in my gopro because that need a fast writing and reading
i recommend iti needed a class  card for my gopro and this one looked like the best deal for the size and i have always liked the sandisk brand bought this for my new gopro and away we go
great sd card at a great pricelove it love it love itvery high quality and what a deal
fast shipping
i trippled the memory on my galaxy s for only   ship
anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great
i have the samsung galaxy gear watch so i needed more room to install programs for the gear
awesome dealthis is a good inexpensive option for my camera
it works perfectly
amazon sells it for less
kingston is a reliable brandi finally have more than enough storage on my phonemore than i will probably ever need
if others are like me they save zillions of graphics apps pictures videos etcand the constant warnings on my screen that i am almost out of room drive me crazy
soas much as i can i add to my sd card  voila
no more warningseven after all that i have in there i still have between gb of room openi dont think i will ever be able to use it all up lolshipper was fast  the price was not too badso glad i ordered this cardslipped right into my galaxy s and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one
allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storagefast delivery
works as described and does the job
kingston reputation was final decision maker
would buy again
using with samsung galaxy swe bought two of these micro cards for my wifes new samsung galaxy  cell phone since she takes a lot of pictures and we wanted a second micro card for backup
all i can say is that the card works well in the samsung cell phonenice pack
installed easily in my galaxy s
works great instead of paying  for a gb phone get a gb phone and add the sd cardordered this to leave connected to an hdmi port on the upstairs tv so my wife could connect her tablet to the tv
it works great and appears well made and should last a long time especially where only the minihdmi connector will the inserted and removed multiple times
no issues with it being loose weak or ready to break
hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge
it arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition and the shipping was exactly when they said it would bedigital works or it doesnt despite monster cables hooey
this works and the price is rightthis cable for under  was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for  dollars
im very happy with my purchasethe cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable
i am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with hdmi out
the photos and videos look greatbought this hoping it would be as good as the  one at staples
for the pricewhy not try it
works great
no graininess
no interruption of transmission
perfect length for my purposes
they must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top qualityi needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv
did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables
cables work and were cheapprompt shipping
on time delivery
excellent quality cable
tested using my canon sx  and it worked really well for images and for video
good buy and great pricewhat pay  for a canon brand cable when you can get this one for under  and the quality is just as good
i highly recommend this mini hdmi cablethis cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my tv monitor
easy to use
clean picture
it does what its supposed to dowe use this cable to hook our camera to the rv tv
works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device
the photos look nice on a large screencan view my pictures right from my cannon ti on my big screen tv with this
it works great but be sure to follow cannons directions
you must have the cable connected and have the tv on before turning on the camera
it is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good picturesthis hdmi cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my hdtv
being told that it isnt necessary to spend outrageous money on hdmi cable has proven true
i now have several inexpensive hdmi cables that work perfectly
i would purchase additional cables from this seller in the futureworks flawlessly to connect my new canon camera to all the hd tvs that i have hooked it to
great pics and vids and soundworks just like my shorter cables only with more optional length
a good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to tv hookup when viewing picturesi bought this to use with my canon g camera
the canon version costs about 
this one works perfectly
no reason to pay a penny morethe cable is doing just what it is suppose to do
the connectors fit snuggly into the hdmi input on the tv and the output of my canon d mark ii
saved a lot of money vs the cable offered by canonjust what i wanted to review photos on my camera via my hd tv
i can sit across the room from the tv and get an excellent viewthis cable does work with my d mark iii and my canon point and shootaudio seems a little off  not sure if it is the cable or not i mean it does not sound as crisp as listen direct from card and from computer  no more thought is given to thati found a tiny hdmi jack on my the canon sxis powershot and found no one had one instock locally and special order i needed to take out a loan
this cable worked perfectly no issues
now my still camera can output full hd videoaudio
signal delivered without errors to monitor
 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mountsvery good and normal quality
you can use it instead of originals
cheap

made well good price and the length is enough to give you access to a system from a table and run it across the floorclean audio and video
good purchasei chose this one because it was the cheapest under  dollars
i tested it today on my ge dv video recorder and used to to connect to my lcd tvs hdmi port
the mini hdmi end went in the camera and the large end in the tv
it worked fine
i will just leave it plugged into my hdmi port  all the time so i will be able to hook up the camera to it for big screen viewing whenever neededvery good working just as i wanted plugged to my ti this is just what i was looking foras everyone should know any hdmi cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so i bought this cheap hdmi cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores etc

i did not have any problems with using this to display the hd output from my camera to a large screenworks great
i lost the original and this one is perfect for my needs
without it my camera is uselessperfect mini hdmi and its a real bargain
there are some hdmi cables that have a very high price range but this one has a really low price and it works great
i am using this cable on my canon drebel ti
the ti takes  mega pixel pictures and i can now see them on my hdtv
i played back hd video on it to and there was no lag what so ever

the cable was  as described and produces a flicker free clear p image
mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cableno problems running from computer to monitor great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just finecable is greatallows me to bridge tv to pc and watch the pictures taken in travelthis past year for a low pricevery stable for tablet to tvlove it

im able to control my camera with the tv remote via hdmi
so why spend more money than you have toworked great no issues
i didnt realize it was  wanted a  but that was my faultcant beat the pricethe cable works as it is described it is thinner then some other brand cables like belkin etc
cant beat the pricei bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it workss excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this producti already used this on my recorder
i got this at the right price
everything here is reasonable and a person cant go wrongarrived on time and as described
plugged directly from my canon dslr to my tv
pictures were clear and bright
great price when i combined this purchase with other cables i neededif you have a canon camera with a port suitable for connecting to this cable but this now
for just a few dollars you can enjoy hd pictures and video on your hd television
cable is nice and long for easy use with the tv
i would recommend to anyonethis  cable works great with my canon ti and my lcd tv
leaves plenty of room to reach the input on the tv and step back to enjoy the pictures
picture quality on my  tv is amazing compared to the rca video cord that is included with the camerawonderful deal on a good length cable with no adapters required
i use this frequently for previewing on large screens works like a charmi used this to connect an older nvidia gtx video card in a pc with a low clearance backplate minihdmi port to me av receiver on a home theater system
cable worked perfectly with no issuesthe cable arrived quickly and is well made with gold connectors 
this conversion of one smaller than the other also will fit most digital devices ie android tablets digital cameras cellphones etcit seems to work ok to connect my tv with a canon dslrperfect length
sturdy and works as good as any other major brands out there
its the best bang for the buckdoes what it supposed to and so far no problems
length is good too as i dont have to be right in front of the tvall the new graphics card seem to be going to minihdmi or displayport i hooked this up from my pc to my  inch lcd hdtv and it works great the display is fabulous
playing games like starcraft  is just awesomenote this is an adapter to go from full size hdmi to mini hdmi this is for digital cameras and other equipment with mini hdmi
this is not for cell phones and tablets that have micro hdmi adapters like the htc evo motorolla droid nexus  etcnot much to say here it works just as i expect it to work on any digital camera ive used
plug it in and youre ready to view files on the big screenworks fine when i use it to connect my android tablet to tv
only used it or times but happy for nowcanon wanted  for a similar cable but i bought this cable for my canon rebel t digital slr at this remarkable price
the cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear
the standard analog cable that was included with the rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal
im very pleased with my purchasei bought this exclusively to use withcanon eos dand i happy to report that this cable works flawlessly with this camerai was initially concerned about the quality based on the price it is been offered and also was worried that the extra length  ft would be an issue when it comes to signal degradation etc but as the cable is of good quality i did not notice any sync issues or signal degradationhaving the extra length allowed me to keep the camera close to me on the couch and view the breath taking pictures and p videos that thecanon eos dis capable ofit is a nice cable very good purchasehighly recommended
 get one to use with any device that has a mini hdmi interfacetested this out to connect a mk android stick to my panasonic plasma tv
works fine no problems i could tellplugged in my tablet  works finei havent tested it on my dslrs but im sure those work fine toothis hdmi cable got shipped the same day i ordered it
i was thinking it would work from my canon slr to my laptop to view photos after i shoot them but it doesnt
i have a small lcd screen i use and it works perfecti bought this for the convenience of hooking up the hdmi port on my canon camera to my hdmi tv
the length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures back and forth at your own speed
plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well but youre stuck using the tvs slide show or other program to viewthis cable has simple small ends not overly flexible or stiff
great value for the dollaryou can purchase with confidenceperfect
does what it says
very reasonably priced
i use this cable for my canon d mkii with various monitors and televisionswhat can i say  it works at a fraction of the price canon wants
i would buy again
prompt delivery
useful product to review photos on hdtvi needed a minihdmi to hdmi cable to hook up my computer to my tv
this is exactly what i neededit works without any problems and ive had it for awhile and moved my pc  tv many times
good durabilityit works great for a canon mini type slr detected the camera and samsung tv with no problems great priceneeded it so i can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time
basically just got it to share fast and it does the jobat the price i paid for this
using twoone as a cameratocomputer and the other as a monitortocomputer cord and have had zero problems with either of them to datei needed this cable to connect my epson project to my laptop
works great and the price made it a no brainer purchasegot this to connect my  ti to my tv and it works perfectly
audio and video are both delivered fine
its good length too
not sure what else you could want from a cable
i suppose its a little loose in the  but im not sure if thats the cable or the graphics card itselfanyhow let me know if you have any questions ill try to answer themthis cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the tv
its long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the tv while using the controls on my camcorder
the connectors on the ends are not bulky and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff
i can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while were on the go
well see how long it lasts but its working great for nowa cable runs lifetime
excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you
product  percent recommendedquality of connection and video seems good with my fujifilm fexr camera connected to my hdtv
 foot of cable really helps so i can sit comfortably in front of the tv at a little distance and manipulate the camerawhat is there to say
i needed a cable to run from the camera to my tv and this is what was needed
it works as expected and allows me to view my videos and pictures that are on my camera directly on my televisioni can find nothing wrong with this cable
it works perfectly and has a great price
i do not understand why the hdmi cables are so expensive at the brick and mortar storesworks perfectly at p hd and in all other canon eos d modes
costs less than  the price of the canon equivalent
expensive high end cables are a scam
it would be crazy to pay more
tip if you have never tried displaying your hd video or stills on an hd tv through an hdmi input you will be shocked by the magnificent quality
absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputsbought this to hook up my motorola photon g to my  inch tv
worked like a charm
you cant beat the price too
all in all its a good product to have if your internet is down and you want to stream hdmi from your phonedevice to your tv like netflix etcon many cars the electric outlets turn off after a period of time when the car is turned off
so if you want to charge from an electric outlet you need this charger
works well and fasti like to know that when i need a device i can use it when i feel like so the need to have it ready and going made me get this at home charger for my garmin
now i can go and around on foot and know that where there is an outlet i can charge up again and go
slmthis product is of sturdy construction
works well with the garmin and you cant beat the low price of this venderhe used it a few weeks and it didnt work after that
he had to return it and they sent him another one
as far as i know this one is working fine
i know initially he enjoyed using iti use a car charger more than i use the wall charger but the wall charger comes in handy at the housei bought this ac charger for my gps so that i could charge it in the house when i get home from a trip instead of leaving it in the car to charge
i would recomend this to anyonewhat can i sayit does the job with no problems
actually since i use my garmin a lot in my car it keeps a charge without having to charge it at homejust recieved my charger works fine 
did not understand all the negative reviews
cant beat the price
shipped on time
like hdethese were a great addition to my gps but i wish i didnt have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gpsi bought the wall charger because i bring my garmin into the house each night
i thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day
now i dont need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended useworks as escribed
shiiping container damaged but no harm to the charger
i use it to charge my garminwhen i use it at homei dont use this very much but when my nuvi has sat in my car for a few months ill pull this baby out and let it charge overnight when im about to take a trip
works well with no problems so far
a good buywanted a spare charger to keep at home for my gpsthis one works fine and  gives convenience at a low pricei keep it plugged in at home to use there
the other chargers are packed in a bag with the gps for when i travel
no wondering to remember if i packed the chargers for travel or left it at homein a pinch should the car charger fail while traveling i can use the other ac charger with my inverter to keep going until i can get a replacementthe usb charger that came with the other set i bought is totally useless
i wish it had two ac chargers instead
if i have a pc then i have ac and would not need a usb chargerbut this one was cheap enough that paying for a useless usb cable from that other company is not that big a dealit is designed to charge your gps and protect the gps battery
of course it takes longer
works fine
i love it
nuf saidat a much lower cost than many cost this does the job very well if you want to do extended work with your garmin gps away from a car like when i was adding all my addresses to itit has worked well with no problems
that is the short and sweet
this sentence is added  to satisfy the word counti no longer buy any accessories for a gps or cell phone accessories or other tech accessoriesdirectly from the retail shop where ive purchased these items as amazon offers these accessories at a much better price and the generic versions ive purchased are excellent and reliable  in this case a charger for my garmin nuvi t
very happy with my purchase
ive had the item for over  years now and it still charges perfectly
trust amazons sellers on items like thisthe charger that came with my garmin was no longer functioning so i was pleased to find this item
it is worth buying
it was packaged securely and arrived very quicklygarmin nuvi  series standard red led wall  ac  home charger is a time and battery saver also the price was righti needed it for a phone and gps battery chargerso far its a work horse and worth the money if you needed it of coarseit worked perfectly
nothing more that i could ask from a home charger
if you need one it will do the jobits a wall wart
its black
it works
it looks just like the ones for my pocket camera ipod amp cell phone im going to have to start labeling these thingsi used it once
worked jus real goodcant find it now  its probably with the  other ac adaptors i have because the idiots in the electronics industries cant agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes grrrrthe thing i liked best about this charger is that one can actually use the gps while it is being charged
as you probably know when the garmin is plugged into ones laptop via usb it enters chargeonly mode and you cannot use the device while its being charged that way
this unit enables one to charge the device in a hotel room without the need for a laptop and allows use in order to find an expensive italian restaurant nearbyby the way though the title says the led is red mine was actually blue horrors
that slight misrepresentation aside i think this unit is well worth the investmentits difficult to write a specific review for this product
it either works or it dont
it works
thats what i want it to dovery happy with it i bought this for my garmin gps it does what it should without any problems great price toinstalled into my garmin  and was able to download entire map of north america
good price quick delivery and happy customeri uploaded all of united states and canada via garmin and have all the space i need for my gpsi needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my garmin nuvi gps
this one did the trickthis is the card that is needed to fit the rest of the maps and traffic updates onto the garmin nuvi  works greatworks fine in my garmin and for a gb card the price is right
i would recommend it to a friendvery pleased with my purchase
i needed a ad card for my gps to download updates maps and fun vehicles
this works great
no problemsi needed this card to update my maps in my garmin because there was not enough room on the garmin to fit all the new maps
this card worked finei have purchased many kingston micro cards over time and have always found them reliable fast and easy to handle
i use them on my gps hd video camera samsung tablet laptops and including my desktop
i do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable
that is important to me as i handle them a lotback and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music my guitar recordings lyricsetc
i have not hesitation to recommend them highly to othersnow i can install the full maps on the micro sd card  gb and have the full  gb available on the gps for vehicle voices and other extrasawesome memory
highly recommendedi have been trying to update my garmin nuvi  with the latest maps for quite some time with no success
i had a gb micro sd card installed in the nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update but it would never complete the download
on an off chance i ordered this micro sd and it worked perfectly the first time
i have no idea why the old card would not work but now it doesnt matter
for the low price and free shipping this is a great deali bought this for my garmin nuvi cant remember the model number with lifetime map updates a  inch screen and live traffic updates
it works great to update the us  canada maps because you need about gb to update thosei was having problems with my garmin nuvi   i could not download map updates
this gb card solved the problem perfectlyit was easy to install and now i have updated my mapswhen i began updating the maps i was confronted with no memory
i didnt realize my garmin had a place for a sd card
duhi ordered this one because kingston is a quality company and the price was right
perfect
im all caught up on my gps updates and assume this gb card will last the life of the gps and not fill upi was not happy that i needed a micro card for my nuvi  i get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them lol
and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one
i was happy to find this at such a great price
it arrived quickly and works great
thanks for saving my nuvi kingstongreat little drive
it gave me the additional space to load more maps on my nuvi
i also use one in my wifes camera
any time i use her camera i swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card
she has about  pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album
this card is so inexpensive that i use one to back up her photos even though i have never had one of these cards failim a musician and i record almost everyday 
these tapes is an excelent way to check my self
very clean recordings and excelent playbackgood tapesas the author of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tent and a former radio discjockey i am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the s and si have used thousands of maxell cassette tapes over the years and the quality has been superlativethe maxell xl is high bias also known as chrome position  and cro
they are specifically engineered for music
if you are recording rock jazz or classical the quality will surpass your expectationsmaxells reputation for tapes was solidified as far back as the s when the majority of the sound crews would use maxell at the mixing board for playback after a live performancein order to get the best result it is imperative the tape deck you use has clean heads all the time
failure to keep dirt away from the internal parts will result in subpar recordings even with first class tapesif you are recording voice only look for the normal bias position  tapes by maxelltry to avoid using tapes over  minutes you will have less headaches with breakage
the  and  minutes are thinner and will tear fairly oftenenjoy the music and be wellcraig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tentfor some reason couldnt find high bias cassette tapes around town
amazon to the rescue
no problems or complaints with this producti have found through my experience that maxell xlii high bias cassette tapes are highly durable long lasting and play back very clear sound
while high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from cds metal bias tapes are they are a big step up from normal bias tapes
i have used these maxell tapes for about  years for everything from voice recordings to sound effects to music
about  years ago i started getting into cd burning for some of my music needs including burning my own original music from tapes onto cd through the computer but i still use these maxell tapes to this day for certain thingscassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past
if you still have use for them then i highly recommend these maxell tapesi have used maxell xlii for over two decades
ive used them on a nakamichi  cassette deck a tandberg tcd cassette deck and small handheld recorders from sony with builtin microphoneive used the maxell xlii tapes for recording albums from vinyl recording from compact discs and recording live eg parties waterfalls and my own electricguitar playing using a nakamichi microphonewhen i first got my nakamichi  i did a sidebyside test of an actual vinyl record and my taped copy of the vinyl recording
i was not able to tell the difference
this demonstrates the high quality of the maxell xlii tape
the particular recording was a duet with max roach on drums and anthony braxton on saxophone
this recording was an especial challenge to the tapes ability to record at higher frequencies
the maxell tape passed the test so to speak
also i recently listened to recordings that i made in the year   i have no reason to believe that the recordings on my maxell tape have deteriorated
this is another good thing about the maxell xlii tapei have nothing bad to say about the  minute maxell xlii tapebut i do have bad things to say about tape recorders
first of all my tandberg is a risky machine
perhaps one time out of  times that i use the tandberg the tape gets tangled up
i blame this on the tandberg not on the tape
another problem is that my nakamichi  has been broken for many years and i have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine
the nakamichi  was and probably still is the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind
but i cant find anybody who can fix mine
again this is not the fault of the tapefinally sony had an excellent little handheld cassette playerrecorder the tcmvk
the sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and childrens music concerts
however i dropped this sony machine and it broke and it is not manufactured anymore
instead sony does make a similar newer model but the sound quality of this sony cassette recorder is garbage please see my reviews of the newer sony machine
but this is not the fault of the tape
sony tcmdv standard cassette voice recorder adds a highpitched whining sound to your tapes
a similar recorder the panasonic rql portable cassette recorder with slide microphone adds a highpitched chirping sound to your tapesthe following applies only to recording nature sounds childrens marching bands and so on
the following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discslast year i bought a digital voice recorder the olympus ds
please see my review of the olympus ds
the olympus ds is an absolute dream and a miracle   because of the very low background noise because of the absence of clicking sounds when startingstopping or when pausingrestarting recordings because of the extreme length of recordability and because of its extremely compact size
therefore at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds marching bands and parties cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choicei use this in my car to play mps of rock db electronic and some metal and it all sounds good
convenient feature allows the cord to come out of either of  spots on the cassette so it can fit in any car and lets you control where the cord goes
no problems yet it does as advertised and as always amazon rocks with fulfillmentyeah yeah so if were looking at these cassette adapters we already know were not on the cutting edge of the tech world
but this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate
works way better than any fm transmitter ive ever tried although i admit i gave up after the first one or two
and the quality of this maxell unit is at least as good as anything else ive come up with the last few years particularly for the price
the heads look well made ive seen others that were downright crude and the mechanism is quiet after six months use
sound quality is certainly good enough although my car is noisy enough that its not a big issue
i cant discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off cds in the factory player so its sure good enough for me
im not an audiophile but if i was i wouldnt be messing with cassette adaptershow do audio cassettes load in your cars cassette deck
do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side
the problem is that most cassette adaptors cant accommodate both types of cassette deckswith this maxell adaptor that isnt a problem
the great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issuesnotesif youre not hearing anything try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side
in my rav cassettes load by inserting the narrow end
but since i didnt hear any audio i thought this adaptor was broken
it turned out that if i made the audio cable exit on the other narrow end of the cassette then there was no problemalso try increasing the output volume of your ipodtested with a  rav and an ipod  gig and also an ipod touch
they worked fine except for the setup issue mentioned abovei drive an old car without a cd drive
it has a cassette drive though and i had an additional mpplayer i did not use anymore so i bought this gadget  and it works
sound quality is surprisingly good the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound
the only little annoyance is that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel
but eventually i will fix it somewhere where it is not in the way anymorei got this several years ago so my daughter could listen to her ipod through the family car radio which does not have an aux inputit does not provide super fidelity but such a device cant ever be compared to a direct connectionit works good certainly met my expectation and it still gets used occasionally to play mps from my phoneso i just got an ipod gb from amazon and was dying to play it in my ride
unintentioanlly i saw this in a friends car and i did some research and a week later its in my hands
well i have to say this is an impressive tape adaptor
the sound quality is just as good as playing a cd and the stereo in my car reads it smoothly
on top of that its inexpensiveso if you are looking for a tape adapto for your ipod you should get this onemy other adapter was taken from my car so i needed a replacement
i am satisfied with this one
it does the job well
im glad i bought itfolks let me be honest i ran through several loops till  i put the money on this adapter
i tried several in car radio wave adapters in car radio listing to my ipod video all of them are crap
i wasted bucks i tried several no brand cassette adapters crap
i wasted like  bucks on no name versioni say if u are an audiophile in your car and your ipod is a must everyday get this maxell adapter
its the only one i found to work fantastically on a lexus gs and a honda and a merc and toyota factory installed playersthis stuff i think has improved over the years
i dont hear any hissing even during classical performancesi ordered this after much searching
i ordered this one to go in my toyota sienna  which has a cassette deck
i chose this brand because i trust it more than the cheaper ones
it plays good through my car stereo
the sound is good enough not as  great as when you have earphones on but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway
so far i am satisfied with ithas a little hum but the highs are crystal clear
sounds as good as cdworks great
it is excellent quality
i use it for my mp player in my car and the sound quality exceeds the ones ive used in the past
i had a couple ones from radio shack before this one that didnt hold up for very long and broke after a short while
the problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player
this cassette adapter uses a much more durable cord which gives it better reliability and sound quality
i have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone
i have a discerning ear for sound quality and this exceeds all other units ive triedupdate  i lost my old one when i got a new car and liked it so much i got another to replace the old one
i had the old one for years without any issuesi use this in my older model truck to listen to my ipod
i have used different fm transmitters in the past and was never really happy with the sound quality
this is the way to go
i wish i had tried it beforei was force to buy this since the one that came with my sony portable cd player and my cassette player in my car didnt get along
i had one of these for years but time got the best of it
so if i have to get another one this was my only choice since it works without any dramaarrived on time
was brand new as described
i like this product because it brings out a little more bass in the sound
this is actually the first stereo cassette adapter ive seen that has an extra bass feature
i recommend it very highlywe got this player because another brand would not work in my husbands taurus
it kept giving us an error message and he could not use it with his ipod
this one does not have the same problems
it works every time
we are very happylove these adaptors 
i got this one  mainly for my car since it  has a  combo cdcassette deckwhich is awesomethis little  gem  does the tricki use this to play  my mp players sony and an ipod   the audio quality is superb its  crystal clear  i  also use this in the house on my stereo systemthis is a great buy
and its worth it  to have a few of these on handyou never know when youll need onei was really surprised at how good the sound quality is with this unit
my old adapter distorted if turned up to loud at the source but not this onethis thing works great
being able to move the cord around is very handy when using this in various places
i use it in my car  home stereo  the sound quality is very close to a cd
there is not very much airy sounding feedback either
make sure to turn the volume all the way up on the device so it will sound the besti love being able to plug in my android phone  stream things from the internet through my car stereoi highly recommend this if you are considering one of theseafter ordering and returning the coby brand version which did not work at all i am pleased to report this one works fine
i bought it to play tunes from my sandisk mp player on my car cassette deck and this unit fits the bill nicelythis works great
it shouldnt be that difficult and it isnt
we used it to connect an ipod to my wifes car stereo
the sound is just finemuch better than an fm transmitter we used in the pastit works
it wasnt expensive
what more can you ask for
only use it for the car
and so for  bucks it represents the cheapest way to wire my podi have a single cd plyer in my  car
never cleaned the lens the entire time i own it
lately its been scratching my cds and frequently not playing themput this lens cleaner in
at first it wasnt doing anything but the cd player just spit the cd right out
apparently the lens is really dirty
after a couple times of putting the cd back in i heard instruction in track  saying that tract  only needs to be played the minimum of  seconds to get the lense cleanedmy player required  playings of full tract  to function properly againwhen i took the lens cleaner out i see a lot of dust on the little brush and on the bottom surface of the disk picked up by static
i think it has done its job and now the cd player is playing my music againthis arrived in only two days so i popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos
this directions are on the disc and really simple
the cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning  i turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish but that is my only dislike
the packaging was very study
i will definitely buy from this seller againmy  pontiac montanas cd player started acting up a few months ago
almost every time i put a cd in the player would spit it back out and the display would say check cd
after  or  tries the player would finally accept the cd
but it sure was frustrating
so i stopped at the dealership and inquired about this problem
the first thing the service advisor suggested was to try a cd lens cleaner
i had never used one of these in my life
and ive had cd players since  but when i went to my brotherinlaws house for thanksgiving he had just purchased this same identical cd lens cleaner at the local meijer store
i asked him if i could try it out in my cars cd player and he gladly obliged
well after one cleaning so far the cd player hasnt rejected any of my cds
and we drove back home after thanksgivingalmost  milesand played many cds
so for now at least im convinced
i came right home and ordered this maxell cd lens cleaner for myself
i dont know if id feel comfortable enough to try it in my mac desktop or powerbookbut i think id feel safe using it in my sony cd player or playstation
in fact the ps will be the first device to get cleaned when this arrives
its been rejecting discs too
maybe the lens is just gunked up with dust
anywaysit fixed my car cd player trouble and saved me a lot of money that the dealership wouldve charged me to service the darn thing
id recommend it highlyafter trying the memorex lens cleaner obtained from wal mart and returning it because neither of my computers cddvd drives recognized it i bought this product the maxell cd from amazon
shipping via prime was rapid and arrival was in excellent condition
the product works just fine thus hardening my positionopinion that maxell products are of good quality and memorex products are of lower quality
 my computers drive can now burn a music cd at full speed and make a product which is playable on the same drive
before cleaning i had to reduce writing speed from fastest to medium to burn readable disksit worked great for me but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me
i found out that you really dont need it
the reason i gave it  stars is the fact it really worksi just needed something any brand would have done
worked great helped alot and was pretty cheap
under no consjust as describedive used the maxell cd cleaner in my car and home players two of them  one a recorder where ive cleaned its mirror too for  years and theyve never failed
these things dont do much you stick it in listen to some jingoism and a pleasing voice on the first track then advance to the cleaning track and wait for  seconds while a continuous beep ensures you turn the volume way down
afterward your lens is clean
thats all there is to itwhy does the lens have to be cleaned
i cant answer that since ive never seen one
in the cassette era i bought a clumsy plugin electrical wand with a metal probe that i had to physically touch to my recording and playback heads on reeltoreel players too to demagnitize them
apparently all that tape going through left some kind of magnetic charge behind that would foul the signal at some point
its questionable whether the gadget i owned ever actually worked unlike this product which works every timetheres no such issue with the digital cd lens cleaner
this disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about  of an inch from the surface of the disk
i guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the cd lens
if theres another explanation id like to hear it
it works every timeunfortunately the thing this product wont do is eliminate age from cranky car cd players
ive owned a couple gm models where the player had to be replaced and the player in my  chevy malibu is becoming increasingly wearisome
it has a habit of failing to play disks that are thicker than the norm
youd think there would be a standard in the digital industry but there is not
sometime spinning my maxell cd arrests this behavior but typically it does not
i usually have to burn myself a homemade disk on a maxell cdr blank disk maxell x cdr for music   spindle to get the recalcitrant player to spin the musicas for the cleaner it works in spades every time
buy with confidence for that purposethis is one of the best dvd cleaners 
i use it to clean my sony dvd burner head once a weeki have not use it yet so i can not write a review for this item at this point but i will as soon as i use itbeen having trouble with both my pc dvd drive and video recorder in getting a good clean start andor playrecord
put this in today and followed instructions and after just  seconds removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past
no problems now
everything i tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly
probably saved me from ordering a new dvd drive for the pc
should have had one of these discs months or years ago
highly recommendedi was ready to purchase a new cd player because the one i had wouldnt recognize any cddvds
i read quite a few ofthe reviews and based on price and reviews i decided on this one
i installed this cleaner into the player and followedthe instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new
great productgot this to clean a dvd drive and it wokred as intended 
its good and useful good buy recommenedi bought this cd lens cleaner a while ago for use with my computer
it seems to work fine and i have had no problems with itthis is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything
but i just finished using it for the th time after which it is recommended that you buy a new one and all the playersburners ive used it on seem to be in fine working order
whether they would be working as well if i didnt periodically clean them is impossible to saythe disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipments lens
it takes about one minute
there are also some additional features which i have never usedi was having a lot of problems with my cd player skipping refusing to play certain cds and randomly changing cds
i thought i would have to replace it which i didnt want to because its a highend one and i just love the sound quality
in the process of shopping for a new player i came across information on cd lens cleaners
people were saying that they saved their cd player
well its true
dont believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out
my  yearold cd player just had a dirty lens it wasnt brokenthis one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens
some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the cd player accepted so that was the reason i picked this oneyou put the cd in the player in my case a  cd changer and hit play
it then plays a little music and talks to you
when its done cleaning your cd player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check  basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels
i was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctlytonight i put in a cd that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song
will wonders never ceaseit played perfectlycouldnt ask for a better product
saved me a ton of money on a new high end i was going to choose a yamaha playerhad trouble with recorder playing and then recording used this cleaner and now works like new
will use on a regular basis from now onthis product was wonderfuli have cd player in my basement which quit playing cd and i used it once and thsat is all it took the lens was clean and have not had any troubles sinceit really worked for me i noticed a difference after the first application but i actually had to run it maybe  times total but now no more skips
might depend on just how dirty your lens is
another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system found out my system was out of phase and i didnt know it
just a fantastic product get it
tommy job involves wearing earphones all the time
so if they are tight my ears get sore and especially where my eyeglasses go behind my ears
these are perfect with really good soundobviously these headphones are not for the audiophile
nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or morethese headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package
commuters some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these
they fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you
the headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it inthe earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear
ive been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort
if you dont demand much in the way of bass or treble the audio range is acceptable
as i said these headphones are not intended for audiophiles
that said distortion isnt a problem even with the audio cranked upthese headphones dont pretend to be noisecancelling
they are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor
they are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months
considering their price the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a painoverall a good value as long as you dont demand or expect more than the product can deliverjerrythis is a great set of headphones cheap only in pricefidelity is finedesign and light weight are impressiveim not a fussy headphone buyer
i like em simple and cheap so long as they get the job donesound quality well they sound good to me
ive had some headphones sound tinny or weird but these sound pretty normal
mind you im certainly no audiophile and i abhor bass in my music and whatnot so take that into consideration
for basic computer usage and pop music these sound perfectly finecomfort actually these are the most comfortable headphones ive ever worn
i get headaches if i wear a pair of headphones for too long due to the pressure on my head
i also cant wear headbands for the same reason
these headphones are so lightweight and flexible that i can barely tell im wearing them  and so far no headaches even though ive worn them for some longer periods than i normally wear headphonesoverall id say im surprisingly impressed with these headphones
i got them expecting the usual cheap headphones i buy the brand changes since i just buy the cheapest phones i can find by a brand ive actually heard of and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones
i havent had them for long so i cant speak to the endurance of them but even if they only last a short bit i think id actually just replace them with these same ones
theyre really that comfortablereally nice headsetespecially for the pricei use it for my radio while i am walkingno more ear buds for menot even me but also my friends used it for our car cassette players
worked well no bad comments
i am happywe bought this maxell audio head cleaner to clean our tape heads on our tape cassette player which is now obsolete being that it was created and used by us in the dinosaur age
it performed exactly as described
it cleaned up the audio heads quite nicelythe music doesnt sound muffled or unclear
now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to
if you own a retro tape cassette player then by all means get this audio head cleaner itll make it as good as new
great product highly recommendi use this in conjunction with a demagnetizing tape head cleaner cassette
both are the same exact thing except that this one has no rotating magnet in it
i wet this cassette with plenty of cleaning fluid and it improves the quality of my playback after playing filthy old cassettes
i play it with the dry demagnetizing tape to dry it off and polish it while demagnetizing it
i recommend this tape in conjunction with a demagnetizing head cleaner cassette as wellim copying old cassettes to mps and some of the tapes are a real mess so after running a couple through the tape player the player starts to sound really mushy
a couple runs through with this tape head cleaner and its back to clear sound againone thing  i noticed another reviewer complained that they were not able to get the liquid out of the bottle because the bottle was too stiff to squeeze  i also had this problem until i realized that you have to stick a pin inside the dropper to break the seal  after that it worked perfectlyi use tapes over and over
maxell has been the best so far use to use tdk but they failed way to soon
i have a maxell standard ive used  times
i tape a lot of stuff maxell high grade is superior to thier maxell standard  for movies you want to save maxell high grade will do the jobmaxell has always been a good brand of vhs tape and this did not disappoint me
i like it aloti use this brand because they last me for years
i use them weekly and they have good video and audio qualitiesvhs tapes are becoming harder to come by
i normally buy sony blank vhs tapes but maxell had the better deal and work just as well
i have used their products beforeafter i initially had some problems the seller sent me a replacement tape free of charge via priority mail
initial delivery was also more rapid than expected
the problems now appear to have been because of some programming inconsistency with one of my vcr recorders
both tapes are now serving wellwe were getting very grained tapes that we could not play back very well
after cleaning the heads with this wet cleaner we now get a very clear play back picture
good productworks great
if you still have the old vcr this product will do a good job of cleaning it
it is simple to usei have used this product time and time again over the years
and when my vcr heads get dirty and when i play my old vhs tapes and the picture is scratchy
i clean my vcr heads with the maxell vp vhs wet cleaner
and after the simple yet highly efficient cleaning this product does i rewatch the same tape and the picture quality is as excellent as it was if i was watching it off my my plasma tv for the first time
you are not going to find a better vcr head cleaner than the maxell vp vhs wet cleaner guys
no one can go wrong with this fantastic product
thank you maxellworked as described
cleaned the heads on my vcrdvd player and the picture quality was better
very easy to usethis cleaner works very well and is so easy to use
i will order more when this one runs outwho still uses vhs tapes these days
people that havent converted their beloved old school workout tapes by jane fonda to dvd
i do not fall into this category but i was responsible for getting a vcr to work
the old one was eating tapes received a new one from a friend
didnt chew up tapes but it only showed a quick  seconds of a tape then everything was garbled beyond recognition
no matter how much i played with the tracking it did not improve
ran the maxell vcr cleaner through a few times seemed like a slight improvement
ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon
put it back in the vcr ran it a few more times bingo works againi read other reviews saying this was not the original maxell vcr cleaner
it seems like it is to me but bottom line i could care less it worked
i will say this though if you want to convert precious home movies to dvddigital from vhs dont use an old vcr
this improved the vcr by magnitudes but in my opinion its not going to be as good as new vcrs that are made specifically for converting and compensating bad track
either that or pay one of those sendaway services to do iti have used this product many times before so knew just what i was getting
it does a very good job of cleaning the track system of your vcr
you will notice a big difference in the clarification of your tapes once you have used this productreceived the maxell vcr head cleaner and loved it
i have always been leary of the dry onesi have previously had these that had a built in button you pushed to put the cleaner on the cleaning tape
they were a very professional way to go and i loved them
this is about as close as you can get to that
i mostly use my professional vcr to convert my old videos to dvds so is nice to keep the heads clean so as to do a great job
i would recommend this to anyonei have two vcrs that are  years old
this wet system gently cleans the heads where a dry system might harm them
do not order the cleandr  vhs video head cleaning system just because it is cheaper than this brand
the cleandr shows a bottle of fluid and describes it as a wet system but it is not
i ordered that first and was sent a totally dry cleaning tape which i cannot safely use with my old vcrs
so i had to return and then i ordered this brand
i am very happy with this purchase
the boxes i ordered  i received look just like the product pictured herei tried to play some tapes id had stored for a long while they were defective from age and humidity and made my vcr dirty and unusable
this headcleaner took a few uses to clean the heads but it got the gunk off and now the vcr works as well as when it was newthis was the perfect fix for my vcr
i did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional but worth the time and effort
liquid drops do come with iti have a sony vhs player that had seen very little use yet i managed to apparently ruin by carelessly slotting a home tape inside which ants had made their lair life in the tropics
debated cleaning the contaminated heads but fearing ruining the device i ordered this wet cleaner cartridge instead
it wiped clean the contaminated heads in one single pass and the playback is as good as newthis cleaning tape has solved the problem with two vcrs that i still use
i dont know how the heads get dirty but this worked wellthis product was as advertised and came with all of the parts
reviewers who downgraded it must have received a different itemi wasnt able to find one of these in local outlets
i have a bunch of vcr tapes i want to convert to digital but my vhs player had given me a clean heads message and i had noticed more than usual static when i was playing the videos
this cleared that problem up
 the wet media in the package appears to be isopropyl alcohol which i will use when the small bottle runs outdid the perfect job for me i have an old vcr i thought was not working so i thought i would at least try cleaning the headsmost stores now a days do not sell this product anymore but luckily i found it on amazon and a great price too it worked excellent my vcr is working again just from the cleaning tapethanksthis cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and i would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleanerwe still use our vcrs to watch older tapes and occasionally the units get dirty and project striations on the screen so that the picture is obscured
this happens probably once a month
a couple drops of the maxell vcr wet cleaner on the cleaner unit clears up all problems
the product does exactly what it advertisesi was volunteered by my wife to record her friends home vhs tapes onto dvds
i have  vcrs both of which i rarely use anymore
between her old tapes and my old vcrs the picture and particularly the sound quality was awful
after i used the maxwell vp vhs wet cleaner the picture and sound improved greatly  probably the same quality as it was when the tapes were originally made about  years agoproduct arrived quickly and was easy to use starsi have to say its a bit over priced for the fact that most dont even use vhs anymore but i actually prefer vhs still over dvds because i dont have to worry about resurfacing when scratched so that the move will work again
my vcr had never been cleaned when i purchased it many yrs ago found this one here on amazon was not happy that this was the cheapest and not cheap but had to get it anyway
it did work thoughi could only see a snow screen on my vcr
now its like new
i went with the wet cleaner since it looks like that is the best way to clean it if you have big problemsi wholeheartedly give this product my ringing endorsement
in all the years of owning vcrs ive never really felt the need to use a head cleanernever really had a problemlong story made short what i originally thought was a hardware problem turned out to be dirty heads
i was getting sound but only noise on the video
this started again shortly after purchasing a second vcr to replace one doing the same thing which replaced two previouslyowned older units doing the same thing
there had to be something else
so after checking all my connections and cables i purchased this head cleaner
after adding the included cleaning liquid i ran it for about  seconds
the thing plays like new well it was new but i guess all these old tapes are depositing a lot of residue on the heads as i run them throughill definitely be using this head cleaner regularlyexcellent vhs head cleaner
been buying maxwell products for years now and have never had any problems or anything at all wrong with themkeeps the vhs recorder in top shape great if you use the vcr alot
highly recomend this product
happy tapingthe maxell vp vhs wet cleaner far exceeded my expections and i will be ordering more of them from you soon
i highly recommend this seller and this productthe head cleaner works fine
i have no issues that i have seen from this product
it works as advertisedi needed my old vhs player to work to transfer videos to mp files
this did the trick
thank youtitle says it all
this product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy thisi heard others rave about the expodisc for some time
i thought the cost was a little high especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance in camera settings grey card coffee filtersdont laugh i did this and it was actually the next best thing to the expodisc
well i bought my expodisc and i am a convert to the church of expodisc
this thing is awesome
it gets me perfect wb every time whether im using natural light bounced flash strobes or a combination of all different kinds of light
i have never once had to change the wb in post and my photos look awesome sooc
you can also use the expodisc as an incedent light meter which is pretty awesome
i would totally buy it againi bought the current expodisc to replace an earlier model recently stolen
the old model seemed overpriced but it was handmade in a low volume production
current models made by new owners are priced about  more than the old for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a cd rather than on a peice of paper  big deal
however the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make
as to function nothing really replaces an expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure
i use mine to shoot grey color negatives to automate traditional color printing
i have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed but logically they should do so
unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing the excessive cost of an expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable
if you photoshop your pictures to death you will get no value from this itemupdate  its over a year since i wrote the original review  radio looks almost new cleans easily works great and still doesnt require frequent battery changes  still love it
youve lost faith that there is such a thing as a good shower radio
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good rock while gettin clean
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good npr morning edition while getting clean
it would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some the morning tv news while gettin clean
all of the above also applies to shaving or putting on makeup
tend to dawdle
it has a timer
get out the door before the rest of the nuts get on the road
it doesnt mind getting wet along with you
batteries have lasted me a month so far
though i dont care
the sound is so good for a shower radio id happily replace them weekly
oh the weather channel  very nice although a bit repetitiveand the top reason you should buy this radio is ahhh nine are enough
just buy the thingi have used this radio for over a year almost every morning for  minutes and i have only replaced the batteries once
great sound easy to use
it is a sony what else do i saysurprisingly long battery life
after doing the research this sony was the one to buy and it didnt disappointnanive had this radio for months now and really like it
i like the digital tuning and timer function
the battery life is great
i am thinking of buying another onei owned a sharper image shower radio the kind with suction cups that sticks to the shower wall for years until it died on me and thought the poor sound quality is the price you pay for a waterproof radio
im so sorry i didnt buy the sony sooner
the sound quality is tremendous
it isnt waterproof but i keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem
i love the big preset selection including local tv channels the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own
great machinei agree that this is the best shower radio
i have been through  other radios all bad
this unit is true  digitial great reception good sound quality and easy to usegot this for my girlfriend and she loves it
shes had it for a little over a year now and it is working great
i recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality shower radio
she keeps it outside the shower to help keep any water from ruining iti recently purchased my second sony icfsv to replace the first one i purchased almost seven years ago
thats right  my first sony icfsv lasted almost seven years which is why i had no problem replacing it with the same model
the reason why i had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time
the second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid  wet conditons
i would totally recommend this product because it looks great last a long time gets great reception a huge amount of digital presets and much moreive bought sony shower radios for  years  this is the third and by far the best model and ive had at least one of all three models
the digital tuning is essential  you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station
i love the presets and listening to  minutes and similar tv shows is great
the solid base means its less likely to fall over or off of things
the radio is pretty tough  ive dropped it and had nothing happen but once the am antenna broke and that was that for talk radio
and the batteries really do seem to last forever
on the one i have now five years old the plastic waterproof top is cracking and the fm antenna caught on something and pulled loose
so im buying another
dont ever stop making this radio sonyive had this radio for over  years now and the only problem is with the fm tuner it died in less than one year
it still works with am weather and tv
since i use it for primarily am its not a big deal
speaking of am this has absolutely the best am reception of any radio ive hadone last comment the batteries last quite a while
i use it at least    mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three yearsif youre looking for a shower radio this is itno need in me going thru all of the features you can see them in the product descriptiona few things that are important though before you purchase a radio for your bathroom
make sure it has a digital tuner
you want to know you are on the right station and you dont want it to drift
get one that has a large battery capacity
ensure it has a poweroff timer
you dont want to have to remember to shut it off when you leave the roomas far as reception  mine picks up great
even without the antenna extensionthis unit has all of these features plus many more
i think you will be very pleased if you purchase this unit  i know i ami have had this shower radio for several months
i purchased a similar model for my parents several years ago
i liked is so much that i finally decided to purchase one for myself
not only can this shower radio withstand exposure to water but the quality of the sound and reception is excellent for its size
it is very intuitive to useim on my second one  had my first one for a year before my sister swiped it and took it back to alabama with her
i guess she must have liked it a lot too
after about a week without it i had to buy another
i do not use it in the shower but i do keep it in the bathroom on top of the toilet tank
wow is it great
one push on top and the radio is on
you dont even need to have your glasses on because the button is big
push another button and you set a timer for it to go off after  or  minutes so you dont have to remember to go back in and turn it off
im listening to the morning news while i brush my teeth and dry my hair and put makeup on and i can put it on a classical music station for a soak in the tub after work
its not too big the controls are simple and intuitive and it looks nice
the battery lasted in the first one for the whole year before my sister took it  its probably still running at her house on the same battery
i looked at a lot of radios before i found this one  i wanted waterproof not too big no cord  there just isnt anything close
highly recommended if youd like a radio in the bathroompicked this one up based on the reviews of this site
absolutely worth it
great sound and ease of useive always listened to news radio in the mornings and i like to take long showers
this is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower
ive had it for over  years now and it has been through just  batteries
it comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the showers wall and reception is amazing
buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local tv stations so you get the audio
sometimes i do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise but i never go more than half way up
this shower radio is excellent get it nowi purchased this radio from amazon in may of  its now january  and the radio is still on the first set of batteries
i use it at least a  hour a day and on weekends as much as  hours per day
fantastic
it shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower and has even been in light rain beside our spait gets great reception no tv signals in our town is easy to use and sounds greati highly recommend this radioupdate oct  after   years of daily use my sony shower radio finally quit
as many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked water got into the off button area and the radio would no longer work
however i just ordered another onethis radio has some very good qualitiespros clear and loud sound battery life is so long it is ridiculous
i dont think i used more than three sets of batteries in  years and i use the radio every day good reception ease of use
i really appreciate an amfm radio with station presets it is waterproof enough that i take it in the shower every day
i dont leave it there though because i use it on the bathroom counter while i shave too
perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isnt in the damp shower area  i like the top buttons
they are easy to hit with one hand
if the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands
my radio is never mounted high so i dont have the issue others complain about where they cant see the buttons
even if i did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bumpcons  is a very high price to pay for an amfm radio it does seem sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longeri was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale
i looked at a few others but nothing matched in my opinion this onethe sony icfsv is a another good example of the old phrase you get what you pay for
at  i was hesitant to purchase this radio but im delighted i did it is worth every cent
battery life is simply amazing i listen to it for a minimum of  hours each and every day and im still on the first set of batteries after  months ive even accidentally left it on for the entire day several times
wow
excellent reception for all bands am fm tv and weather
simple convenient buttons and operation
the o
peace of mind with water resistance ive not placed it in the shower but do have it in the bathroom which often gets quite steamy
excellent sound for the type of radio it is clear and loud
small footprint takes up little space
like the wire antenna didnt think i would at first
it is better than a hard antenna sticking up waiting to be bumped andor broken
timer and autooff timer are quite nice also even though i sometimes forget to use the autooff timer
digital tuning and display makes it simple to find the station you are looking for
the fit and finish is outstanding the radio looks and feels very well constructedoverall a worthy purchasethis is a nice little radio
it has good sound quality  its easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets
the timer function is useful since it does run on batteries
my only issue is that i wish an ac adapter was included so that i didnt always have to run it on batteriesby far the best waterproof multiband radio on the market
i am purchasing my second radio only because after nearly several years of abuse from twin teenagers it finally is starting to wear out
i will not be without one in my bathroomthis is a classic little gizmo
weve used one since the late s and even though the off button has long since worn through it still works like a charmive purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once theyve spent a little time with it they love ittarget and other stores have stopped selling them as offtheshelf retail but i hope sony continues to make this little cbattery shower radio and doesnt screw it up with any improvementsi have had one of these for about ten years and love it
it lives in my shower
the plastic on top has cracked over the years but it works fine
i use it to listen to the local tv station news in the morning
i just bought two more for my kids
 note since tv has gone digital i can no longer catch the tv station in the morninggreat reception easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radioa wonderful product
wellbuilt
very clear reception
easy setup
the flat broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sinkbe aware that the tv channel reception feature will cease in  when all transmission goes digital
until then enjoy itnow i dont have to miss ten or fifteen minutes of my favorite morning talk shows while i get ready for work
ive got this little jewel sitting on the toilet tank where it can project sound into the entire bathroomi love having the waterproof controls on the top and the station presets
this radio also has very good reception bringing in one of the weaker stations i like loud and clearmy one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom
that means the designers thought of slide resistance like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan but they didnt do enough to prevent it
this radio needs big hightraction rubber pads on the bottom and then it would be perfectwhen home i have the radio on a lot of the day mainly talk radio
i bought  of this radio in august  yes three zeros and they bit the dust in late   i got about  years of excellent performance from these radios
i have  because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back  forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed
the other goes between kitchen and office constantly
theres  presets for am
i wish there were more
theres  presets for fm
one used to be for howard until he left a huge howard fan here who has not gone sirius and now i basically only use one for wcbsfm when they got smart and realized in the immortal words of ny daily news that they didnt know jack and the others go unused
the tv channel part of this radio i never use and couldnt commentthe radio is excellent
the controls are responsive the battery life is very decent and most importantly the reception is excellentthe reason my radios now need to be replaced i just ordered one from amazon and will try the sangean for the second is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic
after  years of pressing the onoff button im sure thousands of times the plastic over the onoff button ate through
the onoff button needs that plastic over it to work
the damn thing wont turn onoff now
i tried turning the volume down to zero to turn it off but the batteries do wear out and its annoyingso i figure that  years of constant usage is pretty good and i am not complaining and have even come back for morein spite of the year life i still give this radio the highest rating
fair is fair right
cant complain about  years of perfect performance can we
i say nothis is without a double the best shower radio i have ever owned
the reception is crisp and clear and i love the preprogrammable stations
it is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter
its very user friendly no complicated directions
perfect for us  technically challenged
i would definitely recommend this product to everyonenotice this unit was introduced two and a half years ago and still going strong which indicates to me people really like it and it holds up well
ive had mine about six months
its got everything a radio should have and nothing it doesnt need except maybe the digital clock
the knob on the right top is volume
the rest of the controls are push buttons on the top that include five presets for each of three bands
the buttons are under a protective rubber cover so no need to worry about humidity or splashes
it has an  antenna with a little suction cup at the end so you can hook it on a mirror
and it has a loop of twine on the back for carrying it around or for hanging it on a coat hook or something similari find its clunkiness sort of endearing
the sound quality is all you could ask for and the reception is excellent
so for what it is its probably as good as it getsafter researching shower radios and looking at ones that cost almost twice as much i decided on the sony icfsv and i am impressed with the following points great fit and finish
not too big
seems smaller out of the box than photos on internet suggest
this is good for cluttered showers
easytouse controls for clock tuning and presets
i didnt even need to consult the manual
excellent sensitivity for am internal ferrite antenna and fm a pullout wire from the battery compartment full sound to overcome shower noise
sonys decision to require  c batteries insures longlasting life between battery changesso far i have not found any weaknesses with the radio
sony has found a niche in their shower radio
i give it the fullest recommendation especially for the dollar price and free shipping no less i found on amazoni selected this radio for myself several years ago and i have found that all claims for it are true
it has excellent reception clear sound and the batteries last foreveri dont use mine in the shower itself but sitting on the cabinet
volume is very goodmy recent purchase was a gift there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well
they were cheaper but if they dont work what have you gainedif your looking for a radio for your shower then look no further
this gets great reception and the timer to shutoff feature is very handythis product gets used  minutes per day on average
i also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets  hrs of use maybe once every other week
they say the battery life is  hrs but that must be if you use it  straight hours
we received the radio in early march put in  batteries and they are still going strong it is now december
amazing
sometimes i am shocked when i find a consumer electronic product that works well works simply and works reliably
this is one of those productsreception is outstanding
easy to set up stations
timed onoff is automatic
easy to read display
great sound for a mono speaker
battery life is amazing
worth the price
i would happily repeat the purchase if i manage to wreck this radioupdate  the tv function of this radio is not functional with the digital tv change oververy easy to use basic functions
good tone sufficient volume
dont know what i would change if i could
well donei was given this shower radio  years ago as a gift
i have listened to npr in the shower almost every day since then and it has lasted and performed well
finally the plastic cover over some of the buttons on top started to crack and break off so i just bought a new one
it lasts many months  months
on  c batteries
the reception is pretty good
i was hoping that sony would have made it a bit more modern in appearance but it looks decent enough for a shower radio
i like the countdown timer as i can turn it on for  minutes when i take a shower and by the time i am done dressing it shuts off automatically
thus i dont have to get back in the shower wet floor to turn it offi have to say this radio works flawless in my shower
ive had it for a little over  months and i listen to it daily for about  minutes at a time and i still have yet to change the batteries on it  aa i believe
prior to this shower radio i had a brookstone amfm shower radio which took  c batteries and i would have to change them about once a month
i get great reception of my fm stations and i even get some tv audio through it to listen to the football games
its very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna
all in all i strongly recommend this shower radio over any other on the market
no problems no complaintsweve had ours for a year use it daily in the shower and all over the house and it still looks and works like new
we may have replaced the batteries once
maybe not i cant rememberkeep in mind that its not designed or sold as a hifi radio
its not stereo and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response
but for its size and shape its as loud and clear as it can possibly beyou will never find a better radio for use in the shower the reception is outstanding
the speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower
the case is attractive and tough
the controls are easy to operate even with wet hands
how often do you buy a product thats reasonably affordable and absolutely flawlessupdate  my wife still wont just leave this radio in the shower to my occasional chagrin
she carries it around the house to listen to npr while she works on stuff and i can never find it when i want it
today she dropped it on our hardwood floor
the battery door popped off and and the batteries spilled out
she put them back in and npr was again heard from the radio
why havent you bought one of these yetupdate  still going strong
this radio is no longer available but theicfswseems to be an able replacement
what a workhorse this radio has beeni will admit that i recently gave up my sony headphones for the bang and olufsen as  however that was more for portabilities sake than soundwith regards to sound this is the best pair of headphones that i have usedthe noise cancelling features are excellent
 putting these things on along with the noise cancellers allows you to hear sounds that you never knew existed within many of your favorite songsi compared these headphones head to head on an airplane against the bose quiet comfort  and there was no difference in sound  both performed excellently and equally within the airplane environment  however the sony ones were more comfortable and much cheaperdont even waster your time with the bose quite comfort  grab a pair of these and youll fall in love quickive owned these for years
i used to fly two round trips a week and i wore these constantly whether or not there was any reason to in flight entertainment a cd playerthe first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible
i could hear the person in the next seat better and in fact i found that i could eavesdrop on people a row or two away since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked but the speech came throughthe loud constant background sound in airplanes is very draining
i was more likely to be able to nap with these on and i was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noisedont get a unit that simply insulates the sound  you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds
there is nothing wrong with that solution it is just that the solution of generated countersound exactly out of phase exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones  as far as i am concerned nothing works as wellmicrophones that are placed in an offheadphone device cant tell where the headphones are direction or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones
this effect is not as important at low frequencies but it becomes more important at higher frequencies so this unit can provide more coverage
the design is simply the best possible  microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefitwell being in a quiet environment works better but that is not always availablewhen you are flying especially if you fly a lot small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it
these cost me less than a quarter per flight have lasted years and are still going strongsound quality was fine
i could head spoken voice programming just fine and far as i was concerned music was enjoyable
airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphonesi have used the headphones for  years  they offer a material reduction in the droning noise on airplaneseven when i am ready to sleep and i turn my music off i leave the headphones on and it reduces the ambient noisei think you arrive much less fatiguedi own these and the bose quiet comfort   and i can honestly tell you the bose phones are not impressively better and certainly not worth vhsc is out of date these days but these are just as good a quality as they were when they were the main format
recorded a few things with my old camcorder no issuesa very good producthavent had chance to use the tapes in camcorder yet
i bet i will use this year welll i hopei have only used it one time and so far i am quite satisfied
will order again in the futurethis tapes came out ok just like i expected for my camcorder real nice colors and easy to deal withthese are great tapes and are getting harder to findi love my old camera and these tapes keep it working for methese tpes fit perfectly and have been very reliabl eon my video shoots
i will be purchasing more in the futureshe loves these
although prime is no longer a  day process she still received it in soon enough to take more recordings of her grandchildrenit works for me
thats all it has to do
it was and still is an interesting idea whos time came and is still with usthe palm will certainly revolutionize the way you arrange your life
at the touch of a button you can connect it to your pc and transfer all of its information which also means you can input information to your palm  from your pc
theres a myriad of freeware available on the net that will  enhance the performance of the palm iiix
the screen is great for viewing
mb is more than youll ever need i have many programs loaded and  thousands of phone numbers and appointments and i only use  mbthe  great advantage of the palm iiix is that it uses batteries versus the palm  v and vx which are rechargeable which means you dont have to carry your  cradle when you travel and you can get batteries for it anywhere
small  lightweight highly efficient
i highly recommend iti have had my palm iiix for almost  years now and it is still working as well as the day i bought it
i am more than satisfied with palm products and am currently looking into a tungsten as an upgrade
the windows based palmtops are nice too but they cannot beat the palms reliability and ease of use
the software is also very stable and easy to use
this is the only device of its kind i own that has never lost data or become corrupted
reliability goes a long way with me so i give it  starsi absolutely love my palm iiix
originally my wife ordered a handspring visor for my birthday
six weeks later with no indication of when if ever the visor would be shipping she cancelled it and ordered the palm  iiix for me instead
ive been playing endless with it sincei find  for example its easier to write on the pda than on paper in a moving car  hence car rides can be much more productivethen i found out about  downloading games from the internet
ive been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days quotroguequotthis is my first dvd after thinking about it for two months
ive only purchased it since dvds are entering the rental market
with  lines of resolution using the svideo connector cable this system has the same  picture quality of any current dvd player dont be fooled
 the sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround
great buygave it to my brother  not because the first one broke
ive had it for a year now  and not once did it ever give me a problem  watch the matrix regularly
i get rental dvds more scratched  usually quotmore  difficult to playquot about twice a week  and in the last  months of  renting so frequently i have never had a disc that gave me a problemoverall i think theres no reason to buy a more expensive dvd player   like cd players theyre one and the same unless youre really descriminate  about quality or features not detectable to an average consumeri was initially concerned about buying the rca p dvd player after several of the reviews i read here
however i decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad i did
great picture great sound
plenty of features
i  have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the  dvds ive purchased
this is one great little machine for the pricei was looking around for a small radio to have at my desk at work
i figured with a smaller unit i would save space and not have a very good sound
i was wrong about this unit
i was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit
 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well
i highly recommend this product
it is a good price small and has a great soundi wanted a radio to listen to npr for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo
i did not want a cd or tape player
this is a good little basic radio and i am pleased with iti bought this for listening to npr while working on painting and  stenciling projects on our backporch
i was pleasantly surprised to  discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words
i  also like the fact that it has a solid metal antenna instead of one of  those thin whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our  household my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those  antennas  after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the  living room for the  antenna olympics
another nice feature is the  little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cordi needed a cheap radio for background music
all i wanted was  decent sound and to receive fm radio
i wasnt interested in playing cds or mps
since i do a lot of work around the homestead i wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound
this ge radio delivers on all counts
i live rurally but still close enough to town that i cant comment on longdistance reception
all i can say is that i get all the radio stations that i want to listen to the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in fm music and i dont get any frequency drift so that i dont have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob
its just a great little radio for a very decent price
the only downside is that the fm antenna is quite flimsy and can be alltooeasily bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extendedso great i bought one for everyone in my family
the ultimate christmas present
great range clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries
incredibly durable toofor the price you cant beat this sturdy radio
great sound and durable
use it in the garage and around the deck and its got great volumn and clarity
you cant beat the deal that ge is providing
second model owned had their original model for  yrs and was so impressed i got a new onea friend of mine had this radio for listening to sports
we live in a small town and have trouble receiving am stations from the city on normal radios
with the superadio theres no problem
the tuner is sensitive and easy to use the speaker sounds good and the dials are tough
i think this radio is a perfect part of anyones emergency kit
youd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area
so far ive used mostly the batteries for power and theyre lasting nicely the product instructions say theyll last for  hours of on time
do yourself a favor and buy this radio its a fun toy and a useful toolthis radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up am stations from hundred of miles awaywithin a couple of hours of unpacking this radio and without an external antenna i was able to hear and identify five am stations that were each over  miles away from my home here in mesa arizona  in salt lake city  miles  in denver  miles  in san francisco  miles and  in san antonio  miles
i should point out that this was in the evening when radio signals travel bestone station that has always been problematic for me kbaq  fm transmitting from the other side of phoenix came in loud and almost perfectly clear
unfortunately selectivity on this radios fm band is poor ge chose fidelity over selectivity in this case so  fm in tucson is completely drowned out by  fm here in phoenix
after opening the unit and replacing the stock if filter with a  khz filter please read the superadio faq on the internet for more information i can now pull in  as wellthankfully the radio has a narrowwide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the am band narrow for pulling in those hardtotune stations and wide for getting extra fidelity from closer stationsat  its hard to go wrong with this radio
the next step up would be a shortwave radio like the grundig s  or the sangean ccradio plus update i have only  complaints about this radio moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume but a small effect at high volume
because this radio doesnt have a digital pll tuner it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you werent looking forif you like to listen to am talk radion sports or news this radio is unbeatable
i have the sony icf swgr and the am section cant hold a candle to the superadio iiipersonally i think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found
i am amased that this unit gets the job done for it does what it says
hope this is helpfuljust give me a good amfm radio that performs
the superadio iii does exactly that
the am is so potent its like having am shortwave  so many stations can be found  all over the usa
the first night i ran it through its capabilities from nc we were clear receptioned in chicago miss cleveland ny and other places that didnt identify
great trip
and the fm reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear rich and fullyes its on the bulky side not many bells and whistles but for the price its a real champ
trying to convince my wife to get another one
when it was suggested she could use that one for outside battle won
great radiops
if your battery compartment clips on your super superadio  dont all snap into place and if you havent thought of it yet fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the v of the offending clips and voilagrave the compartment is closed tightly
now its a  star radioi purchased this item then in afterthought read the reviews listed here
so i was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob
but the promise of awesome reception was all i needed to hearfirst off i work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference
i needed something to get past that
that was my only concern
so it didnt much matter as long as i could get past the interference
now that you know that let me tell you about this thingfirst of all its not huge
im  right now so ive seen rickety bulky radios that would kill if it hit you
this is a nice unit well sized for the speakers and antennas in itsecond its very well built
i tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect
even the volume treble and bass buttons nicely placed on the unit cant be removed without some extra tool
the switches are only two function switches and are well built
granted it doesnt light up and the tuner bar isnt a lit bar but who cares its very well built
i tried to squeeze the unit to see if i could make it crack no its sturdynow for the tuning ability
there is a wide and narrow switch which can either give you a very narrow tuning area or a much wider tuning area
a station i listen to at am appears on the wide area from  to about  on the dial
however on the narrow switch it only comes in within a few millimeters of where  is
that explains why people say the tuning was so bad they had it set to wideso all things said and done how did it do against the interference
now basically im stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles
the improvement was marginal
but to my surprise there are additional amfm jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to ltg  i grabbed a power cord wrapped it around the am port and between the improvement in tuning signal grabbing and the extra antennae im getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissingthis is a very nice radio well worth every penny i spent on it
hope this review helpsed williams colorado springs coi have always enjoyed listening to far away am stations at night dxing and this radio is one of the better ones for that purpose even compared to much more expensive radios
it is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna
i have never connected it to an external antenna screws for this are on the back or antenna tuner which i imagine would improve reception
most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy it often adds noise that is bad for dxing
this radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified
it isnt tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker tweeter and basstreble controls
the fm section works very well too
i do not dx fm so cant comment on its long distance capabilities but it sounds good and holds the stations well
it uses long running d cells but i use the internal ac power supply  the ac cord is permanently attachedthere are many reviews of this storied radio on the net you can read so i wont go on and on
it looks like the rca model replaced the ge but i imagine it is the same radio other than the name on the fronti was fortunate to find a superadio ii at a thrift store and enjoy that earlier model as wellive owned a ge superadio since  works great
sounds fantastic
pulls in stations from great distance
seems bulletproof
i especially enjoy the old school knobs and dials
they are no brainers
spin the dial turn it up
done
no digging into digital layersi have several superadios both iis and iiis
im not particularly wild about their redesign of the iiis case the ii had a tremendous generic radio look to it but the reception and audio quality is about the  same
as other reviewers have noted the dial accuracy is poor so you have  to quotlearnquot each superadios setting but once you learn where  stations are they stay putthis is a superb radio with surprisingly  good sound and excellent reception
i have one at work one in the kitchen  and one that i tote around to the beach to the driveway for carwashing  to the bball court
versatile solidly built and nice pricedif you love am radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios the ccradio plus and the ge superadio
these are the best radios on the market for fans of talk sports art bell phil hendrie etc
which one should you buy
i have both the ge for my office ccradio for home so here is my take on the two
both have nearly equal am reception
at night you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live
there the difference ends
the ccradio has a lot of features that i felt i wanted in a radio
it has a sleep timer accurate digital tuning automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time scan buttons lighted dial power cord not bulky adaptor weather radio with auto alert memory buttons tv audio of the network stations
the only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle
they are a family business and take good care of their customers
the ccradio company loves radio and loves people who share their passion
is it worth the  for the extras
to me it is
the ge superadio has a rotary  and inaccurate  tuning dial
this will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching
some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations  it is that inaccurate
there is no timer no alarm no weather no tv audio no lit dial etc
the sound is better on the ge superadio though
the ge superadio feels cheaply made and probably wont make it through many beach or camping excursions
the ge superadio is enormously sized  it is the size of a small attache case or tv
if you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station get the ge radio
that is all you need
it has great almost legendary reception without any bells or whistles
on the other hand if you love radio need the extras change stations a lot want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime want to explore the large number of am stations that are out there go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception see their website to order
i am a radio person rather than a tv person
i have radio playing all day as some people have tv going on all day
i sleep to radio and need that sleep timer
i would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com
i would rather listen to coast to coast phil hendrie and rush than watch another rerun of frasier or friends
if you are like me do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio
you wont regret it
ps the fm reception will be better than you are used to alsobottom line the ge superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky
the ccradio plus is expensive has every extra you could want except a decent handle more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the ge for musicthe rca superadio is a very sensitive great sounding amfm radio
it pulls in stations from out of town and out of state which will expand your listening choices
and is just darn interesting to boot
it is a big heavy unit  more than  pounds with batteries
not exactly a ipod but is fine for carting around the house to listen to while you clean up the garagethis isnt a dxing long distance radio aficionadoradio
for that you would want digital readout and more control over reception characteristics
this is a radio for those those who love the medium listen a lot and want a set that doesnt sound cheap and tinnythis can also make a very good home emergency radio
keep it on batteries ive easily run it more than  hours on a set using it a couple of hours a day use it for everyday listening while you get ready for work in the morning or make dinner in the evening
when the power goes out or the alien spaceships land turn to it to find out whats going onthere are radios that are a skootch above the superadio in reception and sound  the c crane cc radio and sangean prd among them
but the sangean is at least twice as expensive the cc radio four times so
for less than  you can have a highquality radio that will serve you for many years
every household should have oneget it while you can  it seems rca is not making it any more or have cut back on production  a lot of retailers that stock it are no longer carrying iti bought this radio as a garageworkshop unit for use when tinkering around
i wanted something that had no gimmicks that plugged into the wall was analog tuned so there was no power draw or batteries to worry about when it is off and so that i know it will last me a long time without an lcd failure or whatnotthis radio definitely delivers
sound quality is awesome reception is top notch and it does exactly what i desired it to
not small trendy or stylish  if youre looking for that go elsewhere
but for a rugged quality unit with good sound from one speaker you cant do much betteri like this radio
pulls in am stations great
has nice sound quality
ive even dropped this on the floor a few times
still works great
very durable
battery life is excellent
happy with this radioand i bought one for my dad also
the thing i like about it is it pulls in the am stations very well
i listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other cheap boom box type radios cannot cut through the computer generated rf but this one discriminates and i can hear the stations
also the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes
it is also very inexpensive
i would recommend to anyoneso if cc crane is listing this along with their awesome collection of mw  sw radios  wouldnt you get it too
i looked long and hard  crane was ok but i already had a grundig pe  and wanted a radio for primarily am reception i like to dx from time to time ge superradio iii does the trick and i got it from amazon for 
target doesnt even carry it anymore and sears does for 
what a ripoff
thanks to amazon  they paid for the shipping got it before christmas and came in tight packaging with no problems whatsoever
this is the best radio in the business i get kgo from sf like a local la station at night  no static like my other units
thanks
jgthe ge superadio iii is impossible to beat
long battery life  d cells superb am sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to quotwidequot bandwidth mode and sensitivity that allows me to listen to ny and nj am stations during the day at my home in md using just the superadios builtin antennathe only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display but the analog quotdialquot is ok enough once you get used to itthe fm section is no slouch either
mine picks up a distant highschool station without even extending the antenna
and the superadio is also one of only two radios ive ever been able to use at home near a busy tower with no front end overload problems at all
the other radio is a discontinued model that cost  times as muchin  dollarsas the superadio does nowthis is by far the best radio you can buy for amfm reception
the am reception is fantastic with a superlarge internal am antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hardcore dxing
fm reception is so good you dont need the afc function but is only in monaural
tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners
there is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thingthe six dcell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms power outages and to tune in faroff stations without electrical interference
the power supply is well shielded from noisy power sourcesthe sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble which is perfect for attenuating static and whine
the speaker is enormous and the radio features a highquality tweeter
the sound quality both on ac and batteries is superpowerfulthe volume and basstreble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but thats the only complaint i have
the antenna is easily replaced if damaged
it seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not waterresistanti have several of these radios and have given them as gifts
there appears to be some variance in quality between units such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker
some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency youre tuning but i dont think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anywaythis is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale
the regular price is excessive though even for this level of quality
edit  in  this radio is now known as the rca superadio iii
model numbers include rca  and rca rp
i am listening to the original reviewed item right now and im glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback rca brandyeah its made of plastic
dont throw it down the stairs then
just put it where you want it and enjoy it
now that ive got mine set up where it can pick up stations and ive got the volume and tone set the way i want all i do with the controls is switch between the same two stations on occasion
so i suspect this radio will last a whilethese radios are especially useful if your home office is partially or completely below ground like in a finished basement
or if you work in a metal framed office building and you want to listen to talk radioam signals are directional
you need to find the location of the transmitting tower for the station you want to listen to and then point the radio toward the tower
thats what i did and i can listen to radio in a place where nobody else canits also a good general purpose portable radio for sitting out on your deck listening to the game or music or whatever
its not as bulky as a boom box but its got better speakers than most portable radios so it just sounds better in return for a slightly higher pricepostscript  in all fairness to those who comment on the build quality i will say that my radio stays in one place tuned to one channel and maybe tuned to a second channel on occasion
i hardly adjust the controls at all
so maybe those who are complaining about the construction quality have a point
im just not using this radio in a way that involves moving it or manipulating the controls much
it has a very easy lifeits big its bulky and you cant carry it while youre roller blading but the ge superradio has the best am and fm reception of just about any  portable radio on the market short of a  lowe
its especially valued  for its sensitive am reception its a favorite of am broadcast band  quotdxersquot chasing distant stations but the fm reception is nearly  as good
spend some time listening to it in the evening and youllbe amazed  how many am stations are out there that you never suspected existedafter i loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house he ran out  and bought one his old job site radio just couldnt get his favorite  stations
he listens to it at home now too
for the money theres just  nothing else that even comes closeive been a radio buff for years amfmshortwave have tried receivers from bargainbasement level to the  digital jobs and cant tell you the number of times ive responded to another radio by thinking pretty good am receiver but not quite up to the old superadio iiiif you want the best am reception possible and demand the convenience of digital tuning get a ccradio for about if you listen in an area that gets poor reception like a basement you may need a more expensive receiver that can accept an external antennabut if all you want is the best am reception and great fm sound at a reasonable price the matter is simple and clear  get a superadio iiiand by all means run it on batteries  the d cells give the unit a wonderful heft that keeps it stable and even seems to improve the sound somewhat and are remarkably longlastinghope that helpsthe superradio iii is a one of a kind radio that will get you far better am reception than even the legendary grundig s
its fm is equal to the grundig s and its speaker is even bigger and fuller
i cant overemphasize this speaker
it can fill an entire house
its the biggest speaker of any radio i own including my grundig sthe superradio iiis am is leaps and bounds beyond any radio you can buy
no comparison
and the reason is plain other radios have a conventional fourinch internal ferrite am antenna
the superradios ferrite antenna is in contrast eight inchesweak points
well the cheap build quality and you have to suffer with a less than precise spin dial
also some dont like its huge size
but for the price i cant fault the radio
for strong amfm reception with a big full speaker than can fill a huge room look no further
buy a superradio iii for onefourth the cost of radios that wont give you as much bang for your buckat this price point the superradio iii blows away the competitionthis baby is about the size of a couple of laptops stacked and turned on edge
its hard to miss almost anywhere you put it and probably too big to look ok on your deskbut the sound is huge and there is much less am buzzing pretty much none
than ive experienced with the halfdozen other radios ive tried in my house over the yearsi listen to just two am stations so tuning has not been a problem for methe superadio has a plug coiled out of the way in the battery compartment so you have it if you need it
and since this is no walkman you may find yourself able to plug it in more often than you might expectreally excellent reception
very good sound quality
separate treble and bass controlsi was surprised by the good reception
highly recommendedvery sensitive radio on am widely considered the best buy for the money by far
very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performancesound is top ratedial calibration is poor but you can  get used to itits exactly as sensitive as the ccradio at  with  much better sound than the ccradio
lacks only the ccradios digital  tuning
sorry art belli have spent the last  weeks trying to get decent fm radio reception in the middle of an office building with significant emi electromagnetic interference
i tried three radios including the radio shack rs portable amfm radio with extended am range cat  which is modeled after the ge superadio
the superadio and the rs  are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features
my goal was to receive my favorite fm station which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations
the superadio with the help of a c crane fm reflect antenna found at was the only radioantenna combo that would bring it in for me
i also tried  other antennas including  amplified antennas  another nice item is that i get excellent fm reception on almost every channel now
the ability to turn off the auto frequency control seems to make all the difference for my needs
the rs  had the same switch but i didnt notice a significant difference when i turned it on or off like i do with the superadio
the only thing the rs  had going for it was its sturdier case but it was  more even on sale
i havent done much with am so i cant comment on that
i hope this is helpfulif you love a place you accept it warts and allthe biggest wart i have had to live with is that while i live in a pretty civilized and tech savvy area santa clara valley i also live in the crotch of foothills and at the bottom of said hollerfor years tv reception was horrible until we got cablebut radio reception never improved
we went through a half dozen radios attempting to find something that could grab a specific pbs station we enjoyed most kqed from san franciscocan you imagine hearing garrison keillor over a crystal setthings changed for the better only after we followed a recommendation in amazon to this ge portablesomehow i think it is a tuner knob that is a precise as a laser knife and a tuning band that seems a foot and a half wide we can nail the signal
after that it is a matter of playing with afc bass treble and a view other variables to pull in a signal that is not only there but pretty goodthe only real drawbacks come from sun spots when they flaired we could could hear them
and oh for a while we heard a neighbor use her cordless phone which was odd and entertaining for a couple of saturdays until we figured it out and knocked on some doorsthe only circumstance that changed our way of life with  the ge came with internet radiowhen the internet has gone down it has out comes the ge
if you live without cable or the internet in some fringe reception hell as did we get this radiogood listeningthis radio compares favorably to my two ccradiosit has a slide rule tuning system and you can more accurately tune into a specific station
at night the selectivity switch really shines as you can tune in distant stations easily or eliminate the interferenceit is a different radio and i like both this one and the ccradiosfor the money unbeatable
the tuning dial is not at all accurate but that is no big deal once you know where the stations are that you want to tune ini also like the advertised battery life although i have not tested the longevity of the batteries yetso i say get one of these even if you are going to get a ccradiothey are both pretty much the best am radios goingbeing a former ham radio operator in the s i appreciate the features ge put back in their superradio that used to be standard
the best is the tuned rf stage that pulls in distance stations with ease
second is the dual power feature a line cord comes built in and in battery mode it takes  d cells so they last a very long time
third two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume
its hard to believe you can buy this for under 
this is a great radio and i will be buying more forchristmas presentsthis is the best sounding radio ever especially for its size
you can adjust the bass amp treble to your liking
i have the first one i purchased many years ago it still works perfectly
i have recently purchased an additional one it is just as good as the original
it is easy to bring in stations on this radio that dont come in clearly on other radios
this is a solid sturdy radio like the ones from years ago
the radio has a full rich warm sound from its large speaker
it is hard to believe a radio so compact can sound so big and wonderfulthis is just a fantastic productive owned two for fifteen years and hope they never stop making this model in case i want anotherthe sound is great the reception is great the price was great the durability is great and the battery usage is great
its all greatit is certainly not feature rich but who needs all that nonsense for am and fm radio
more feature would just get in my waytip the radio has a ground screw on the back which im guessing most people dont use
after hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna i noticed that what really helped am dx reception was the groundi bought a grounding rod from radio shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system
i pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house
that really helped
so much so that i removed the wire antenna and now only use the groundi ordered one of these right here on amazon back in jan  my specimen was probably manufactured in  i should use it more than i have but it still works very well
of all my other radios only the old panasonic allchrome  modelrf
can shade it on am and the difference is very small at best
on fm the extra long whip antenna really helps here in the semisticks and it does very well if not quite up to my little grundig g with dsp
sound from the big speaker is excellent
recently ive begun using it late on sat nights to listen to  am from st louis a long way from ne texas
fades inout a bit less than my best smaller radios on that
mine even has a fairly accurate tuning scale tunes  wsm with the needle centered on the  of   woai with needle on the  of  certainly too close to try  modify
battery life is looong too manual states about  hrs on  alkaline dcells
want to use ac instead
power cord  transformer are builtin no wall wart to get lostwarts
power switch seems a little fragile no light for the sliderule  dial
some will miss a tuning led lamp and though it will handle headphones no fm stereo through phonesbest testimony ive seen was from someone near new orleans who had no power for weeks after katrina all local radio stations were knocked offair he used one of these as his primary radio to get news  info over am stationsive read lots of reviews stating that the later versions sold under the rca name are problematic
maybe so but if you can find one of the ge models at a reasonable price somewhere and you like radios my advice is get it quick before someone else doesit is sensitive and because of it range you can tweek in stuff from far away and then flick a switch and pow even more rangehad a halicrafters  band radio beck when i was a kid it had range with the external antenna but this is a very good radio under battery power or plugged ingood buy for the pricethats right  excellent am radio
good for news and talk radio good for music of the s also a true reproduction of the s impression
 for am programming this is my choice
however for fm and concert music i go with trevolie model one its simply amazing and inspiring
and for an all around portable radio the grundig s is my choice it is much more refined and functional
all three are keeper in my book
in my search of a portable radio i bought all three within two month time frame and am very happy with the flexibility and quality i getfollow up to my initial review back to august  my superadio is still on the first set of battery and working nicely no trouble whatsoever
so far i am convinced if it does not pick up the signal both am and fm pretty much thats it the station is out of range
i use it mostly for am yet fm reception is just as good
by itself and tuned at a moderate leve the sound quality is ok overall a nice radio and well worth the moneywork well for signing thingsthis stylus is metal with a high quality plastic tip thus giving it some needed weight and smoothness when compared to palms pure plastic quotcheapoquot stylus
the end unscrews and reveals a pin to reset your palm in the rare case it crashes
a small purchase that makes a big differencewhy are you even reading the reviews
they get lost easily they get easily left at the office and theyre inexpensivego get some morethese stylus are much better than the generic plastic one that comes with the palm iiixe
these stylus are much more rugged and reliable and are built to last
you should definately replace mr default stylus
the reason being that these new metal stylus will improve your grafitti skills fold
another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip
much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device  pick up these stylus if you havent already they are really good
certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price
plus you get  of them in case you ever lose onemy new iiixe came with a flimsy plastic stylus which was not particularly easy to grip or manipulate
these replacement styli are plastic and brushed metal prividing a much better grip and improved heftso youve got a palm and you consider yourself a decent graffiti artist a whiz with the stylus
not if youre still using the cheap allplastic stylus that likely came with your palm
these replacements a set of three  have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more  like a real pen in your hand making tapping and writing dramatically  easier and more comfortable
the hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the  screwtop of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for  the occasional soft reset and the horror of the hard reset again
its a  stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the  plastic one as i found when i left one at the office gave one to my  girlfriend and lost the one i had in my case
argh
youll never willingly  go back to the allplastic stylus again
the price is right so buy one  buy two buy one for the dog not really
dont tap without itthe original stylus that comes with the palm iiixe is a simple lightweight plastic device that youll want to replace immediately
simply put this stylus threepack is a bargain and should be the first accessory item you add to a palm iiixe purchase
these have a metal barrel that makes it feel like a real writing instrument and not a toyput one in your iiixe one in your briefcase or purse and maybe one in your car and youll always be covered
read the other reviews here and youll see that most of the owners agree  get this and you wont be sorrythe black molded plastic stylus that came with my palm iiixe was lightweight functional  and scratched my screen rather quickly thanks to some excess flashing near the tip
these metal styli dont exhibit that problem
the extra weight also quotfeels betterquot in a way i cant describe otherwise
its not that much heavier but it does feel more comfortable in your hand
the best feature though is that unscrewing the top gets you to a builtin reset tool
unfortunately especially with thirdparty software you will need to reset your palm on occasion and having a handy reset tool saves on batteriesyou never know when youre going to need it
a good traveler always knows where his towel err stylus is at all timesif you have a palm youre going to lose the stylus
if youre like me  youre going to lose one about every four months
so youre going to need  replacements
if you havent lost your original stylus yet waityou will
or better yet toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement  stylii
the cheap metal stylus that comes with the palm iii is hard to use  because it is too light
i have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the  original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard i ended up  gripping the stylus
these replacement stylii are a heavier metal which  is easier to hold and considerably more accurate
highly recommendedi bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my dvrs require
ive had no problems with this uniti got this for a friend to use on his dial up modem and it works flawlessleygreat buythe headline on this review says it all
im not mechanically gifted in the least but this rca wireless phone jack did not test my technical acumen
thank goodnessits easy to set up just click in a couple of leads plug it in the wall and voila instant dial tone good to go and bobs your unclei bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my dvrs require
ive had no problems with this unit
this was an expansion for rca rcive owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless
this unit fits well and the sound quality i hear is superb
ive asked those ive talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear
guess id have to give it a total of five starsthis is a great headset
the volume is just a little lower than i would have expected but overall i am very happy with this headset and i would buy another if i had the needi read the reviews about how theres too much static when used on a phone linei wouldnt know
i only bought this thing to get a credit on my dish network bill
they dont tell you they charge per month if you dont have it plugged into a phone line just that you get a credit each month if you do
for one year it doesnt pay but for a yr contract it pays itself off after the first year
so since i didnt have any phone lines anywhere near by this thing works just fine for what i needive used the rca rc wireless modem jacks to create a poor mans wireless network in my home
it works
and i love it
i can now sit in any chair of my house surf the web and print across the room to my wireless hp  bluetooth printermy system consists of two sets of rca wireless modem jacks a sender and receiver unit in each set  one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected a com bluetooth pc card for my laptop and a hp  bluetooth printeri now use my laptop in the following manner first i plug the rca receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where i want to sit then i turn on the printer and finally i extend the little blue toothshaped antenna how cute
on the laptops pc card  and im all set to gothe rca modem jack is good up to k which is ok since i dont have internet cable or dsl service in my area
but ill gladly tradeoff mobility for speed any day
heres whymy desktop computers old and new are in my upstairs bedrooms  where i cant use them when my family is sleeping
they are also far away from where my family spends most of its time  and thats downstairs by the tvswith the rca wireless modem jacks i can now access the internet  while watching tv with my family and i can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep  when internet speeds are fastest
the connection is fairly clean free of static and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if i had accessed the phone jack directlyive gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net
when cable or dsl eventually come to my neighborhood i guess ill have to set up a wireless network in my home for a lot more money  in order to maintain my mobilityuntil then ill use the next best thing  rcas wireless modem jacks
theyre greati made the mistake of buying the rca wireless phone jack to connect my tivo downstairs in the living room where i dont have a jack
it did not work
once i finally reread what i needed i bought the rca wireless modem jack
it works perfectly and i havent had any problemsi bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack
installation was a snap and it works great
sound quality is awesome and in addition you can use it to connect an access point router to expand the reach of your wifi networki have had my gps for about a year now and love it but i have  problems with it the interface is very difficult to use and tedious to search for a city or road
by the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another  miles
also mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload
so i downloaded the latest patch for it and tried uploading with no success
i have gotten a number from magellan to return it but lost the number actually my dad did so im returning it   but i must say it was great while it worked and the tech support is fast and reliablethis is my first gps unit and i could not be more pleased
it is simple to use and easy to carry
i have used it to mark civil war battle sites and to find bench marks
it takes me right to the bench marks
if you are looking for a good unit the  is the one you are looking fori have a couple dvds that had relatively small scratches on them but deep enough to stop playback and i was able to get them to work correctly
it did take a couple applications but the sections where the dvd would stop and shut off now play continuously through
make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything driesbeen using this stuff for a couple years
works great for me
i use it different than the instruction
find a flat surface lay a bundle of tissue on it place the disk scratched face up
place a couple drops of  abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward you dont have to wait  minutes
keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry about  minutes
spray once with  and using a clean tissue continue wiping very gently radially outward until  dries
try the disk
if it doesnt work repeat all the above until it does
this really does work but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches
ive had a lot of scratched disks and i havent found one yet that i couldnt fix with thisi got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them
they are so good  you just listen to your music and nothing else outside
they have few jacks to fit to different systems so it can be universal to many audio electronics
also it stratches somewhat so it can fit to different sizes of headi really like these and they do cut out the noise only one thing i dont care for id the piece that hangs on the cord
it holds batteries in it so the batteries of your player can last longer in energynice idea but awkward in use
it is heavy in weight and in a bad spot
this little box should have been higher up towards the head instead of the middle of the cord
however it is a nice headphone and studioqualityvery nice
i used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where i needed a headset and microphone combination
i remembered that these had that feature  it was not one i could figure out on my own though i did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at but maybe thats just me
anyway once they were all set they functioned wonderfullythese cassette tapes work well for my needsi use them for lectures and not for musicim happy that they are still availablei have used maxell cassettes for over  years and never have been disappointed
if you ar an audio purist dont purchase this go for the higher bias
for normal folk like me with tinpan ears this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price whether that price is retail or saleits funny to appreciate a source for these tapes but i do
i may be old fashioned but i still like using my cassette player and tapesi immediately passed this link to friends still using magnetic cassette tapes
they are getting harder to locate and this brand length and packaging are excellent
arrived on time and in perfect condition
i might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience
no damage to tapes or their plastic casesso i acutally bought these tapes for an art project and i am not going to be using these at all
i dont even have a tape player anymoreboth projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases
thought i would give both a try and see which i liked betteri really like the first one better i bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the basei have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms put on walls
fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didnt waste batteries
pi needed to buy cassettes elsewhere than where i was buying them from
they were getting more expensive each and every year
luckily i thought about looking here
i found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago
it literally brought back childhood memories well not really but it was very inexpensive
i still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves
and when they did the prices were high
i highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on amazon they have many different brands to chose fromall right i did not time the recording to make sure i actually got  minutes on each side but the tape snapped into place securely and i recorded from one end to the other without it tangling inside the recorder
when i played it back it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles
i have used three or four of them without a hitch but then i generally do rely on maxell for my taping needs so i was not surprised
i will buy more again when i need morei always order these cassettes online
although people now use cds i give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so i dont have to deal with burning cds
buying online is less expensive and easier to find
saves me the trouble of locating a store that still carries them
usually one walgreens that i know of has them but its hit or missrecently found a really great onkyo head motor cassette deck for playing my old cassettes from years ago  for low dollars
this is the best price ive seen on good normal bias tapes  the chrome high bias type ii are just too pricey  but these sound just fine for all my music whether rock jazz country or classical
getcha some before the type i prices get stupid too
and enjoy some george jones singing along with a beethoven tune while david sanborn blows his sax and jimmy page picks his axeif you love to record music from cds or the radio  dont want to pay an arm  a leg for good quality tapes these are for you
i have bought   count packages of them so far
im very happy
i intend to buy morei just wrote a review on  maxell tapes  pack
this  pack  of  minute is a good buy of fine quality reliable blank tapestwo relatives still have multiple vcrs and they tape a lot of stuff
tapes wear out over time so i buy them new tapes once a year or so
these tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year
i have never gotten a bad tape or had tapes breakif you have an old vcr that still works and you enjoy taping your tv shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes
this will more than likely become even harder
we located these on amazon
they are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find
these maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantasticthe package arrived in about  days and in the advertised condition
ive bought maxell products in the pastespecially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes and have never been disappointed
the color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes
i know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the track and im trying to slowly make the change over to digital media but in the meanwhilei can highly recommend this maxell pk for your vcr recording needsalsothis vendor appears to be a fine onei needed some new vhs tapes and these fit the bill perfectly
they have been working well and im very pleased with them
amazon has really good prices on everything anyway so i knew i would find a really good deal and i didi have used these vhs tapes before and the quality is great each time
i will buy these the next time for making copies
darrylif you still use a vcr these maxell video tapes are a good quality
i have used them both for everyday recording of television shows and a onetime use for recording a movie i want to keepgreat price and delivery
we cannot often stay up later to watch a favorite show so we tape it and are able to watch it later
maxell makes a good product that lastspractical and affordable as usual
thats the maxell brandit still gives you quality  integrity with each and every producti use these tapes because unfortunately i still live in the th century and still enjoy taping movies
one day i will order a dvr but for the time being these tapes are greatits nice to know the possibility is there to find them
with them and vcr players next thng ill be looking forwe bought a vcr for nostalgic reasons
we like everyone else got rid of our vcr back when we made the transition to dvd but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia so we bought a vcr some tapes and these blank tapes to reexperience what it was like watching vhs as kids
these are good tapes
they play wellof course this is a great great buy you dont have to pay a lot for quality vhs tapes anymore so we didnt
we got a bargainthey are hard to find these days
i still prefer my vcr to dvd because i simply do not want to keep  of what i record and vcr is still the best way to go
dvds are too expensive and i do not use cable or satellite or things like that
i get over  digital channels with my rabbit ears  and have very little time to actually watch tv so i still rely on my good old vcrdvd recorder to help me eventually view shows i want to see  when i get the timecurrently im moving some family memories from older vhs tapes to dvdram and ripping them to a digital format on my pc
since these are important memories i want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto fresh vhs tapes is something important to me
comparing these tapes to local price the price here on amazon is very competitive
after recording older footage onto these vhs tapes im quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the sp record setting
not much has changed in the vhs tape since it has become such a dinosaur but its great to be able to get this product when you need it for a reasonable pricethis was fantastic you see my husband and i have a unit that requires vcr tape and we tape our soap operas and this is the only way we can get them
stores just dont have what we are looking fori admit i still use a vcr  probably will forever just seems to work better for me
these are hard to find these days so glad you can get here  the price is good
its a quality item as i use these over  over  they never give me problemsyears ago i would be able to buy vhs tapes in just about every store
not they are harder to find and when you do find them they are expensive
here i was able to buy vhs tapes for under 
not only did i find my type of vhs tapes but found other types as well such as pro tapes etc  i plan on purchasing other types of cassettes in the near future only because it is affordable and convenient to buy
i also like the fact that they are delivered to your home at no extra cost
i highly recommend buying vhs tapes here i have purchased over  tapes so far and all recorded perfectlythese do the job expected
no problems with recording or playingit seems vhs tapes are being phased out at least i cant find them in local stores anymorethese do at least as well as what ive used in the pastthe price was right and the quality is what youd expect on a vhs
i am using these to record minidv films and would recommenda couple of the tapes required break in and i suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording
i have dmrs and record tv shows on ep mode
both sound and video are good even on a  d plasma and w sound systemvery happy with this product
it arrived in record time and the tapes work well with my vcrs
would recommend to otheres that are still using vcrsi like to tape a lot on my vcr and this is a quite reliable product
i will continue to purchase thesehad them shipped directly to my brother on the other side of the state
he is a little old fashion and still records on tapehe tells me that the quality of his recorded material plays back great especially the football gamesi bought these to use with my vcr little did i know my hdtv will not accept my on air vcr lol so now even though its a great buyim going to use this some other time im glad i bought it thoughi have found maxell to be one of the reliable vhs tapes
sony and tdk i have always found good too
for those who dont know the  minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a   when tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity
therefore i dont recommend  for repeated reusing but for some long thing or somethings adding up to  hours at sp to save and watch sometime
the s i use and reuse a lot and keep a lot too
  long may the vcrs surviveps
oooops
made an error above
i said  hrs
at sp
of course we all know sp is the fastest
lp or slp  whichever your vcr has as slowest is what i meant
fast speed recording is considered best by some
pause at sp gives a jerky picture
at slp you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot and the overall clarity and quality of the recording i consider quite okthese are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a vcr
i will use them and order morei bought this pack specifically because each tape is  hrs long
this length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty longthe quality of the picture is still pretty good even at  hrs
so far i have had no problems with these tapes
i suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noisei got these at a good pricejust under seven bucks on amazon
vhs tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so i am glad i can still purchase these on amazonif you still use blank vhs vcs like i do this three pack is really handy
i know that most of us are using dvds now but i still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour vc and this fills the bill
this tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and i would surely suggested it if tape is what you needthese tapes are oustanding
brillant picture
no tracking problems
i used to buy another name brand  hour to many tracking problems
first time buyer for maxell very happy with the product excellent price and qualitybelieve me i have gone through tapes since vcrs first came out still have the original ge vcr
cannot go wrong with the maxellgreat product that performs exactly as needed
great look to it and could not be more pleased
i live in the absolute boondocks  miles from the nearest walmart  miles from even a mcdonalds burger stand
i absolutely count on amazoncom to order things i need they are nicely delivered by mail ups or fedex and spare me the need to travel long expensive miles for some of the simplest things
amazoncom rocksmy maxell  vhs t standard grade   pack arrived on time and in good condition
it is very hard to find vhs in retail stores but i am glad these tapes can be found here at amazon and other websites as well
these can record up to  hours
i have a vhs tape eraser which is a giant magnet so when after viewing my recorded program i erase them to record another program
very durable
can be reused over and over again best when you erase with the tape eraser otherwise you will see your old program under your new program
i recommend this product
i rate this a  starmy husband was very please with these vhs tapes and he was excited about the price
he would definitely purchase more at a later dateperfect for people like my daughter who like to record their favorite shows to watch after work at night
with up to  hours on a tape you can get quite a few shows on one tape of course i dont recommend recording on slow speeds if you want to keep a quality recording
a perfect solution for those who dont want the expense of tivo or similar devicesi use these at work and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk
i often have to travel around the building
i work with computers andi wasnt sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy  equipment around us but it works great
highly recommendedterrific value for the money
sound is very clear and warm
upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded  phones and speaker systems
the bass is not muddy but it  is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones
but the overall sound is still excellentrequires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it
dont set the level on the transmitter too high
you will get speaker overload
you can listen throughout your home patio and garage
but you generally get some bursts of static as you walk
none of these drawbacks bothers mebest for listening to cds
sounds great with lps too but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you  are probably used to hearing from the riaa jacks that your turntable is connected toworks very well
used on  different cd players that were starting to skip and took care of the problem
easy to follow audio directionsfor quite a long time i believed that the cd player in my truck was broken
then i thought hey why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe itll work
it did
the cleaner is extremely easy to use
you insert the cleaner disk into your cd player and follow the directions which are said aloud to you and in no time the cleaning is done
after its done cleaning the disk plays some nice classical music for you too
i ejected the cleaning disk inserted one of my cds and voila
it was working againi purchasd a used original xbox really cheap and it wud only play a few games and those that did play wud freeze up
i orderd this lens cleaner and the transformation was instant plays all my games w no freeze
i also hav a few high end dvd units one an expensive samsung dvd recorder that stopped recording and playing discs and a toshiba upconversion dvd player that stopped reconizing and playing discs
i popped the lens cleaner in and their both working beautiful now i was going to throw them out
a great product and i can use it over and over if i hav any other devices that stop reading and playing discsi purchased this from amazon  years ago and here it is  years later and it still works perfectly
i had to write a review on such a great product
it is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road
your television cd player receiver computer etc
these are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budgeti live in a highrise apartment right in downtown boston and there is much dust
when a cd player starts acting up you dont know whats going on at first
if its dead its dead
but if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do
is it the player itself
first you clean the cds
maybe its a simple problem
well my cd player was having a field day at the time  cds jumping and skipping all over
i purchased this product used it correctly and voila  the cd player worked perfectly
all the problems cleared up
now whenever it starts to skip i know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple cleanbottom line this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection
i have had it  years and it is still going strong
i highly recommend this product
finally something that actually does what it says it doesi have a modern warfare  edition xbox  its not that old but here in west texas we get a lot of dust
my console pretty much stopped reading discs
i would have to eject a disc and put it back in at least  times before it would read it
i ordered this based on the reviews
i figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away since it didnt read my games
so i put it in it would spin up and then would say no disc
this only happened once
the next time i ran it it read the disc
to be safe i ran the disc  times
i put in a game it would not read and it read it on the first try
i highly recommend this producti have the boston acoustics bookshelfstyle player no longer made sadly
its a great cd player and radio with all of the features i wanted
it looks and functions like the bose modelbut i hate bose with such a passion i wouldve paid more to not buy their product
the ba unit kept returning an error message cd 
after one was inserted
this cleaner used one time fixed the problem
problem hasnt occurred again in more than a yeari was hesitant to try itsome reviews and advice said it could ruin the system
but i was going to not use the system anywayso i took a chance
turned out to be a good decision but i dont know enough about why it works to say it would be safe for every uniti thought my expensive old sony cd player was finished  it skipped and sound was not as good
allsop restored the player to original good quality
i highly recommend this producti cant say with any certainty that its the end all laser cleaner
its ingeneous approach does seem clever though
consumers buy this product when their cd player starts skipping
i did too
if youre  lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser youre in luck
one cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem
good luck its definitely worth a tryover the course of the last few months my cd player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a cd at all
 minutes after my package arrived with this cd cleaner in it and i was playing cds again
i can also play cdrs now something my stereo hasnt been able to do for six monthsthis product really does make a difference
i had an older cd player that was doing a lot of skipping and sometimes it would not function at all
i ran the cleaning disc through it once and now its working just fine
great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year certainly beats having to buy a new cd or dvd playeri have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem
it has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lenscant say enough good things about this
it took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car cd player
i was shocked that it worked so fast 
just listen to the voice and switch to track  then after the music on the cleaning disk stops remove the disk and your done
unless they came out with a better product i dont know why they stopped selling this one the cd player in my car went haywire
cds were skipping and others wouldnt play at all
thought maybe it may need a clean up
wow
put this in the cd playerran it twice
thats all it took
and to think i was ready to pay to have a new one installed
have to agree with othersdont buy a new cd player before trying this
besides the music on the cd isnt so bad eitheryestheres music on the cd cleanermy professional cd players have always performed well
they are broadcast quality units and it is just not acceptable to have them skip or not read a disc
one of my players recently began to do just that and i was hoping to just get the lens cleaned with a laserlens cleaner
this particular product did the job and so far the unit reads better and does not skip anymorewhen the cd drive on my toshiba laptop refused to write to cds i was convinced i was in for a big bill
then i decided to try the allsop cd laserlens cleaner
it cured my problem in less than  minutes
so if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution
but dont expect it to cure mechanical or other problems
if your cd drive is giving you problems this is worth a try
if it doesnt work you are not out much and you know the problem isnt dirt on the lens
my only complaint is that it is not clear when it is through cleaning so i cleaned the lens  times before i was convinced it was donethis laserlens cleaner works well for what we intended to use it for it helps to eliminate dust from our cdsi was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my dvds so took a chance on these and ordered them from amazon
i dont know what theyre made of but they work great
they clean bluray as well as regular dvds without a bit of scuffing or scatching
i followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge
for fingerprints i found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping
the nice thing about these is that theyre reusable until they get dirtyi was expecting to buy a cleaning system that has at least a liquid solution and of course those fancy ones with a machine that rotates the discs
but ended up trying this out because of its cheap price and its fastwipe title but still a bit skeptical without any wet solutioni am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward
the discs are cleaned within a matter of  to  seconds for a thorough job
i find myself having fun wiping the entire collection of cds dvds and bluray discsthese are good cd cleaning wipes for cleaning fingerprints stain and other marks on a cd to avoid going to a dvd store to get it cleaned
good additions for cd protectionsi used this on a disk i was having problems with
after i used this the disk played finethe instructions told me to wipe on the side with no printing
i was always wiping on topi down load a lot of cds and need to keep them nice and clean
i will use these wisely and keep all my music cds clean from finger prints and dust
thank you so much
beverlypretty simple product
there are about  or so sheets in a package
take one out and wipe in a circular motion
gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine
however if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stainsthese are indespenisible around our house
out grandchilden find then and play with them
ive witnessed them trying to get our wee dog nola to catch as one would catch a frisbee
thankully we have only totally lost a few cds
easily replacablei use these wipes all the times on my electronics
they are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean cds and dvds
i use them from time to time to clean vcr heads too
i just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol
it works a treat
i highly recommend themthis was the first time i have used such a product and was pleased with the results
works great for a fast clean before playingi got these to clean dirty dvd and bluerays that i got from netflix
works great
saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the diski purchased this allsop cd and dvd fastwipes and cannot complain about the product for the cost and how they work especially when picking up dvds or cds from the library to watch or listen to that have smudges that can break up the signal and freeze the visual
they do work but dont expect miracles for nicked or the surface film damaged dvds that need to be tossed
recommend this product for a fast and time saving cleanup of your dvd or cd i am definitely going to order another pack before i run outi use these to clean every movie i receive from netflix
i repurchase these wipes every couple of months to clean rented bluray movies wii and ps games
i prefer to see the dirt im removing
make sure you wipe back and forth away and towards the center of the disc instead of wiping in circles as stated in the directionsgood price but they dont work as good as a mild detergent and warm water
these still leave fingerprints on the disc
good for a quick wipe but not a through cleaningi have looking around for this item for some time
i had some trouble fined them
it work really goodi have usually used wet cleaners for my discs but have run into quality control problems with the units
i decided to try these not expecting much
surprise they work great
i had purchased some discs with excessive fingerprints and the like these cleaned the discs right up
as noted in the item description some small scratches or scuffing can be caused by the wipes not a major problem if care is taken
i will definitely buy again when my supply is goneat first i thought it was little bit expensive price but when i get it and use it it is not definately worth the moneythis cd  dvd wipes really cleans
the wipes is good quality cleaning materials cleans the dirts and finger prints off the dvds very welli definately recommend to give this a try worth your money it does the job good
thanks amazondvd fastwipes clean my cds and dvds and make them extremely clean it wipes of dust and dirt and does a great jobi just bought my second pack of these wipes
i bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them
i was totally surprised that these wipes work so well
i have had dvds that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface
taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge across the grooves seems to get the job done
today my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a dvd he handed to me
when i put it in the player it skipped and then stopped
i pulled it out and saw the crud
i used a fresh wiper and voila
the dvd played without a hitch
i know i am probably not supposed to do this but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a dvd and i use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two
i havent seen a downside
i truly think they are amazingi have purchased many of these belkin velcro cable ties over the past few years
they are well made and very usefuli love these things in fact i use them in my backpack to manage the cables i travel with
power adapters for tablets phones chargers and computers with all that i carry a bunch of cables
so its nice to have theseif you have cords that you want to identify or cords that you need to pack away then these are excellent
i use them on my laptop power cords headphone cords etcmy stereo system was a jungle of wires once i used these cable times i tamed that jungle
i love that i can remove the cables that i no longer need and add new cables without cutting cable tiesthese work and look exactly as expected
easy to use
what more can i say about velcro strips
evidently i need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this reviewthis are great
they are high quality
nothing more to say really except that they work
i use it for all the cables on my computerquick reusable and color coded these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management
easy and reusable unlike ziptiesgood product and different colors come in handy for using a certain color for a specific device they are priced right so like me i bought  packs that way i have  ties of the same colorfor no more than they cost i would recommend these to everyone
yes the colors are rather primary and boring but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abusethese travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great
im ordering more as soon as i finish typing this review
seriously stop reading and just buy them alreadythese were purchased as an add on item and must say that they fit the bill in our house
we use them as a tie on the cords for equipment that we move around the house
easy to wrap and unwrap
thanks amazonas someone with far to many computers anything that helps me tame the mess of wires is welcome
this fit the bill well and i like the tab that makes them easy to removethese are great
that the hooks of the velcro only occupy a small strip on the band isnt a big deal
they hold well theyre colorful and good quality
my strips from eight years ago still worki use these every day for keeping cords neat since i have a lot of computer equipment ipad accessories power cords etci travel with cpap machine and this works great for my hose power cord and extension cord
highly recommended ai have been using these for a few years as i use belkin av pure cables a lot
the colored ones are nice think i will use them to color code cablesa simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib
i like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords
these are well madei love this things
i use them to keep wires contained and out of the way and i use them to keep things organized and handy
they can be reused over and over and the colors help to organize and mark thingsstrong velcro grip long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one
good productthese ties are just what i expected from the photo and description
they are   velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily
the colors are identical to the product photo and the quality is highi use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job
the only improvement i might suggest is make the tag white so i can write notes on it with a sharpie like pr for printer or st for stereo
other than that they are perfecti hate having long cords gather up in a pile and look ugly
these ties do the job and make it look more organizedperforms as expected from any cable tie
i like that its velcro and reusable unlike the stiff plastic ties
i used it to clean up the wires under my desk in my tiny cubicle at work so that im not constantly kicking or stepping on wiresits so much easier to wrap a long cord and put a velcro tie to hold the cable in a shorterbundle than having several feet of all the cordsive been using these allot latley and these work great
dont tear or come apart and the velcro is enough for office use
not recomended for giging musicians or roadies these are not strong enough for road use but great in the officeshort sweet and colorful
everything you could want in velcro ties
im not sure how else to rate these
theyre as advertised
for me it was hard to find short sizes and they were close enough
the colors are an added bonus
they are highquality sturdy and lock together wellthis product is very good high quality good service and fast ship
it is sutable with my think before i got ittheres belkin velcro cable ties  inch are excellent
with the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one im looking for
all of my cables are bound together with the monster cable management system also sold on amazonneeded some wire wraps instead of wire ties to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cords in place while not in use
i tried some other brands and was more of a pain than help
seen this at amazon and it couldnt work better
easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed
get price too even if it is an addon item
thanks  dont spend a lot of money
buy these easy to use velcro cable tie wraps that allow you to use and reuse over and over again  comes in multiple color pack for that color coding you want to do
remember these arent just for cables
ive used them to hold shelves together for extra support
these really stay stuck together
ive chained a few together for a bigger project i needed help together
a must have in any householdi carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use especaily with the different colors to chose
i have used them to temporarily hold something in place while i am trying to drill it in place
i have even connected severl together for larger itemsthese ties are perfect for managing cords
i like that they are reusable and can colorcode your electronics
i use the colors based on sound cords
for example blacksilver for hdmi and redgreenblue for compositei would recommend getting two packages though youll probably need more than you thinkpros does what its suppose to do with excellence the multiple colors help a lot in organizing which cord go with what or which cord are what velcro is effective and sturdy great pricecons only bad thing about this is i wish it came with more ties but i dont really think thats a good enough reason not to buy itoverallexcellent choice if you dont want to get the highly expensive cable shields and very reliable
great choice and great buygreat wire ties
easy to use release and reuse
the colors make it easy to identify different cords
highly recommendi first got these because i needed just over  cents to get free shipping on an order
in that aspect these little things are greatthere isnt much to say about a cable tie but for that extra nudge to get free shipping these are a mustprosinexpensive bump to get free shippingvelcro and multi coloredno more crazy wiresconstag fell off of one but for under  bucks not that big a dealtoo short for anything other than cables again not a real con but it would be great to see a similar product with more lengthi bought  packs of these so far and as long as i still have cables i will slowly get more with each amazon purchase ummseriously
 for these
these cable ties are really good quality have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all
different colors makes it easier kind of to keep things organized but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you haveyou can never have enough velcro cable ties
i use them for everything
i also have plenty around
never know when you need oneive used these velcro straps and similar velcro straps from other manufacturers for several years now to secure cables for computer systems networking systems and entertainment systems in my home
before i discovered the velcro cable ties i was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end pull until tight and cut off the tail
but the thing i didnt like about the plastic cable ties is they cant be reused and you have to cut them to remove them
thats not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables but in my case i seem to be upgrading something moving something repairing something or throwing something away on a regular basis
that meant i was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties getting new ones and retieing everything which i sort of began to dread and then loath
the velcro cable ties make it alot easiertheres is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight but once you figure it out its very simple and you can get them very tight if you want
ive never had one come lose on its own so theyre also very reliable
basically id recommend this type of cable tie to anyone and this particular product from belkin has worked well for megreen ones for hard drive red ones for dvddrive  blue cable tie to help with fans and wiresworth every cent
every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced cabletie system in placeyou can buy the same thing at the dollar store
save yourself the five dollars but if you want color coding this will work well for quick visual idthese are so much better than using ziptiesn theyre easy to see and  more important  much easier to remove
how many times have you needed to remove a ziptie and you had to find something sharp then hope you didnt cut through whatever you had bundled together
these are great for the jobeasy to use velcro fasteners to keep wiring tidy and neat with a belkin labeled pull take to easy undo the fastener
it workstheyre little velcro straps
not much to say here they work exactly as youd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organizedif youve got any devices that have cables this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled
whether youre traveling or simply want to gather cables together so theyre not hanging or lying all over the place these ties do the jobthose are exceptionally well made
i used cheapoproducts before but these are really nice quality and come with a sling on one end that allow you to slide it onto a wire provided the plug on either side is not too large so it does not fall off when untiedi absolutely love these ties and purchased  sets
im a guitarist and constantly having to wrap up chords and wires is annoying especially when i try to take them out again only to find them a tangled mess
ties are a perfect solution to this problem
i wrap them up and stack them then when i use them again theyre still nicely placedthey look exactly as they do in the picture and function as well as you would think
they are velcro and they hold very well
ive had no problems with them yet
i have been using them heavily taking them off and putting them back on again for months and havent noticed much wear at all
sometimes the soft side of velcro frays and becomes useless over time but i have noticed almost none of this with the belkin productmy only complaint would be that they are a little pricey for something that just holds stuff together but you definitely get what you pay forthis is just a high speed usb cable and is of belkins normal good quality
it does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellenti had a printer i needed to connect to and this was great for doing that and the price was great for what i needed it fori had to buy a printer cable for my epson   when i priced around this could not be beatwill not work with parallel port only computers for the person that had a previous review this is a cable that will only work on a printer that has a usb outlet
this is not for printers that are strictly parallel port hook upsends for printer and computer different the usb end that is for the printer if you look in the photo is the small end to the left
it is only about quot wide and shorter than that
the usb end for the computer is the big end to the right in the pictureabout quot wide and shorter than thatmany usb printers have both usb and parallel port connections many usb printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well
that is one of those huge flat type ones roughly quot widethis may sound simple for all you computer experts out there but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that it can get very confusinggreat buyyou did a great job sending this printer cable to me
i got it really fast too
thank youbought it on sale
cheapest i found no problemsi purchased this cable for my brandnew wireless printer after it didnt work so wirelessly after all
i leave the cable attached to the printer and simply plug the usb into my laptop when i needed to print a document
the cable has worked great over the past several months
i did check my local electronic superstore before purchasing a cable via amazon but i found that comparable cables a ran a high dime
for its quality you cant beat the pricei have been using this cable with my samsung laster printer for over  years now and couldnt be happier with the no problem performanceits long enough to be used as a printer cable which is important and it works
what more can you ask for from a usb cablemuch nicer setup than the bulky parallel port setupthis cord does what it says dont waste your money on topoftheline cords they sell at best buy or other palces
they all do the same thingexcellent cable
very reliable
now if only my operating system is the same wayclean connections and flexible cable
no reason topay x or more for any other cable that does justthe samethere is not much to say
the belkin usb cable works and is priced right on amazon when compared to the big box stores
if you have a need for this item get it
you cant go wrongit works great to run a cable from the computer to the photo printer
the cable works great love how long it iswhat can i say about belikin
belkin makes great products which makes me satisfied with this cableplease price this belkin usb pro series  cable at your local office supply store
i did
it is over 
another amazing amazon deal
we have three in use
stocking up on a couple of extra at  each with free shipping is a good idea
quality printer cables will only increase in the future
and the hits just keep on comingthese are excellent quality usb cables that will allow you to connect any usb device printer etc
to your pc or other usb deviceits always good to have extra usb cables floating around
 for home  for work and  for the laptopsparei decided to purchase this cable after noticing that dell computers offers it online at its online store which it often bundles together with other data transfer hardware
so i decided that if this cable is sufficiently wellmade for dell to offer it at its online store then its one i had to consider seriously as a usb cable linking my laptop computer with a brand new laser printer
without question i made the right decision
i am quite impressed with its excellent data transfer speed superb workmanship and ease of use
its an excellent product which i highly recommend to others seeking a well made high speed usb cablei bought this cable to use with my new printer
ive had it for about  months now and its working fineive always seen highquality products from belkin and this one is no exception
it is a highquality usb cable at a great price by a leading computer accessory company
an extra bonus is the lifetime warrantytheres no reason at all to buy misc
electronic usb cables anywhere except through amazon
prices at the shacksmartsand the lesses  usually will cost you more than double for the same electronic items found on amazon
so let your motto always be caveat emptor ie buyer bewarei really like belkin products and this cord works great from my pc to the printer and could not ask for it to do morehooked it up between my printer and my pc and printed about  pages with it
works fine
not as quite as cheep as monoprice but the super saver shipping will make up for that if youre ordering more stuffdoes the job intended good value good quality
not a bad product for the pricethere are better products out there but not at this price pointit might be a little short but seems to be a fine cord dont know what else to saymy amazon verified purchase badge for this cable dates all the way back to september   according to my instant order update
ironically the cable is in the other room connected to a printer and still transmitting flawlessly
the moral is this is one well constructed cable and has returned my investment many times overthe connectors still mate and disengage smoothly like the first day i used it and i am pretty sure that the beefy strain reliefs on each end are responsible for keeping the conductors inside the thick insulator intact
indeed as i inspected this cable before writing this review i marveled at the construction and materials
both are first ratethis cable has traveled extensively  it was part of my travel kit when i was a road warrior consultant and served me well in many us states as well as the middle east on long and short assignments
back to the strain reliefs i would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case yet the ends never damaged which i attribute  in part  to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductorsbottom line  this model is now usb  compatible and is built to last
in other words you cannot go wrongthis is a good usb cable
it is compatible with both usb  and  ports
it is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to
the price is extremely good even though amazoncom changes it every now and then for this cable
it is way more expensive in stores
and getting a belkin product for such a low price is excellent
this is totally worth the money and is a great buy if you need a usb cablei was looking for a usb cable to hook up my allinone printer i found this and i dont regret it the build quality is excellent i recommend itconsidering all the overpriced products on themarketthis cable does the job perfectly and theprice is great
thanks amazonthis is a reliable brand and does exactly what it is supposed to do
great product for the price
i only needed one but was tempted to purchase more just because it was a great value
i would buy againpackage was recieved barely  days after i orderd it i am extremely happy  would that all packages arrived aspromptly as this oneokay since most of the printers dont come with cables any longer you always need to purchase one separately
a quotregularquot printer cable can cost around  and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs
so a usb cable is a great solution
it costs less and its easy to plug and unplug especially if your computer has frontmounted usb ports
i bought this one for my new hp laserjet  printer and it works just fine
for this price its a great bargaini purchase a new inkjet printer from a very well known computer store  i wonder who that might be hehe
but getting back to the review  as most of you know a lot of usb devices dont come with a usb cable
the same thing applied when i purchased my new printer
the clerk who sold me the printer suggested i purchase a usb cable along with my printer  the asking price  for a  foot long cable
i told him quotnoquot
then purchased this cable on amazon for  which included shipping
the only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than i paid for the usb cable
oh well
i bought some sushi with the  bucks that i savedwhen i bought a new printer for the computer i use i needed a usb cable to connect the printer to the hard drive
i ended up purchasing this usb cable from belkin
it works great and ive never had any problems with it
even though the cable is a  device it is apparently backwards compatible and will work with most  devices tooabsolute dependability no matter the device they connectran a local networked computer on this wire and had no issues whatsoevergood quality and no speed issues whatsoeverupdate still using the wire for networking with zero issuesthe item arrived in a timely matter and works greatnot much to say since its just a usb cable
i ordered it it arrived and it works
i plugged one end into my computer and the other end into my printer and lo  behold i can now print things from my computer just as you might expect
it does what its supposed to do with no problems so five stars
too bad everything cant be that simplethis cable is very good i recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend ita good quality cable at a reasonable price
works as advertisedthis cable works well and is a good quality product unlike other cheap cables which sometimes affect the usb transport
i recommend itgreat does whats described sorry cant think of anything else to say except i hate that we have to do this in twenty or more words totally excessiveits an extension
kind of hard to say more than that
its a belkin cable so its good quality
the ends have molded strain reliefs
this is a usb  cable however so data transfer speeds will be slower
but if you are using it only to charge something it wont affect itgreat usb cable durable made very welli use this cable to add a extra usb port on my desk so i dont have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other usb devicesi use a mac and everyone knows mac lovers keep their keyboards
the one thing is that if you use a mac keyboard they have the shortest cord ever
so i got this and it worked like a charm giving me that extra distance between my mac and my keyboard on my desk keeping the wires off the top of my deski needed an extension for my wired mouse and this extension was the answer works great plug in and gowith the popularity of flash drives and the inconvient usb connections on most computers in the back or in the front that requires lying on the floor to make the proper connection a usb extension makes a lot of sense
this one fills the need splendidlythis is a staple that you must have on hand
it has so many uses
it is a good productgood cable no drawbacks works fine clamps on firmly not much to add herethis is the best deal you are going to find for these extention cables great qualitythis is a great accessory to use with a webcam on a laptop computer
my webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that i use
because of this i had to position it on a nearby flat surface but the cord was too short for my needs
with this extension cable i an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off or having to constantly be repositioned
the cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into usb connectors
very useful devicea  meter usb extension cable for this price from a reputed maker is a surprise
works wellii needed this to expand the reach from my laptop that i have connected to the flat screen to the marble mouse and worked fine
price was good and product is belkinthe cord worked great
i needed a longer cable for my logitec mouse
the cord fit on there prefectlyi had a  pc that i needed to run
it booted up and ran the display
unfortunately i did not have a  keyboard
this adapter filled my needperfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a ps type keyboard with ituse with an opposed adapter to monitor a server with an old rack mount terminal
worked as expected
 star because you can fined theseit does what it was supposed to do
it works well for the computer it was bought for
thank yougreat if you need to work on an old school computer tower and dont have an adapter plug for your minidin plugas most of the old school users will remember these adapters came with every keyboard and computer system until the motherboard manufacturers finally switched over the standard input type
it was a welcome change toothese plugs are very handy to have especially if you do any computer work such as repairs mods or upgrades
its a tool youll suffer without if you dont keep it in your toolboxthe package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape
the adapter is exactly what i wanted and makes the connection i neededperfect worked exactly as expected
needed this to attach my model m keyboard to a kvm switch
so happy typing on it nowaffordable and works for us keyboard nerds who love the old style keyboards
i even use this attached to about  more adapters and i have no keystroke loss or anythingmy favorite uncle now in his s hangs on to an old  pc running dos even after i bought him a new pc
he uses both
but he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old pcat style keyboard connector
he wanted to use one of them with his new pc that has usb inputs only i had previously bought him a ps keyboard to usb adapter so he could use his other beloved only slightly newer keyboard
he called me asking if i could find a way to get his old big round plug keyboard with the new pcthis belkin fn adapter was just what he needed combined with the aforementioned psusb adapter
i had it sent to him and he called me a few days later with delight saying that the adapter worked perfectly adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was usingit is a good cord
simply packaged
nicely pricedthere is not much more to say about a simple cordnot really much to tell
i needed a replacement power cord for a computer puppies chewed the old one bought this one from amazoncom plugged it in the computer works
as jerry pournelle has said before about belkin products it just works
and the price is righti needed a replacement cord for my computer and this one works great
very easy to hook up and at a great pricenot really much to say other than it being exactly as expected
lost the cord to my tv moved it around a lot and this fit perfectly
cord doesnt get hot at the connections and fits sturdy into the plugs on each endcables either work or they dont
belkin works great its now my brand of choice and i dont look at any other cable other than an amazon brand cablethis extension cord is a waste of money and i feel like a tool for ordering it
i should have ordered a cheap one instead
i guess i bought the brand name instead lol fmli just built a new pc when it dawned on me that i didnt have a power cable
i borrowed my printers and bought this one right away
cheap and it works
what more could you wanta friend of mine gave me an old computer of hers but the computer lacked a power cord
low and behold belkin comes to the rescue
the power cord was perfect for the old pc but would be good for a new one as well
it never hurts to have extras on hand when it comes of cords and cable for any computergreat product from a reliable companyfor such a low price it is great
it is true to belkin qualitylow price high quality product cant be beatsomehow in my piles of cables and connectors i managed to lose one of these
i bought this as a replacement for my thecus npro server but also tried it on my ps and samsung  lcd tv
it worked fine on all of themthis power cord fit the monitor and the outlet
what more could i ask for
worth the  if you need one of theseworks great
i plugged it in to my acer monitor and image is as it should be
no cut outs and good qualityi needed another power cord because i forgot to bring it with me on a trip so i ordered one from amazon and got it in two days amazon primethis belkin cord has a higher quality than the one that originally came with my pc and the price is very reasonablei recommend it highlypurchased these for the two hp monitors we picked up at the local goodwill
cheaper on amazon than buying at the electronics store and works just fineseriously this is a great product to have around when something gives out or stops working
or to leave plugged in at difficult to reach receptacles where you might use some type of pluggable device burner printer or even a small desk top cpu or a monitor that you occasionally move around
belkin quality here even at this price
my power cord came from techused company though that name is a misnomer because the cord was brand new in original packaging
shipping included
it arrived quickly ahead of schedule nicely wrapped  other companies compete on this item literally different by a pennyi thought that techused did well for me and some other companies might not do as well with this or other items just saying from experiencethis cord did not warm up or soften at the ends when used with even old crt monitors and computers addressing concerns seen concerning other similar power cords
if you need a longer foot cord then look at the foot belkin cord belkin feet ac male to female replacement power cord by belkin sold by amazonthat longer one being available here at amazon for a little more than twice this ones price
since you never know when you might need that extra lengthbuy bothhigh quality material and brand
you can buy this product to replace any cable if you broke the original or if you want to use a diferent male to avoid using an adaptergood quality its sort of hard to write allot about a cable but i would buy this one againthanks jpwe needed a replacement power cord for a lcd tv
did a bit of looking around all of the ones we found were  and up for a power cordnot only did i find this belkin power cord on amazon for much less its a name branded ul listed and just a higher quality cordafter getting it out of its package it didnt retain its bentwadded up form eitherproscheapul listed far too many companies are using cheaper certificationshas a good memory ie
doesnt stay coiled up from being packagedconsdoesnt magically lower my electric bill
lol works just like any power cord should no issues at all bought as a replacement for one that was ran over with a sweeperdoes what it says says what it does
youd have to work to screw up a power cord imo thoughi needed this cord to supply a desktop with ac voltage
it works perfectly
i have no complaints with itworks like it should and cheap as well
worth it in my opinion and i definitely recommend it if you need a power cordi dont know what else to say about this product but its exactly what i expected and works for me
im glad i could find one at this price
any electronic store would sell this for good snug fit on both ends
no overheating of cord with my computer hard drive and screenworks perfectly
good sized cord which is average for  foot cord length
had lost my  previous cords
belkin makes a good productlooks nice considering its a cable
it works well too
my only issue is that i find it a bit short it is the correct size but for my preferences  feet isnt that big for cables in general
regardless did its job well
i am satisfied with it
bought had enough to make it possible to get this wellpriced cord
very happy with it belkin makes a good line of products at least so far as ive foundwell known make to me always rated
used a few times and no issues yet
hopefully will last a number of yearsthis is what i used to replace my monitor power cable that i also lost
this way i was able to turn on my monitorbelkin is a good brand so i did not hesitate in purchasing this power cord
anyway there is not much science in a power cord
this one fit perfectlythis is one of those products that either works or it does
in my case it worked
i used it to power a crt monitorproduct came in belkin packaging and was the same quality as power cords that come with computers and printers
worked perfectly with my lcd tvit works its long its tough its high quality material my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this
if your looking for a power cord that just does its job then get this one
you cant find a better ac adapter power cordthis is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers
this is way cheaper here than in walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra i needed a power cord for a cisco switch i bought recently
this cord was cheap and got the job done
ill be buying another one if i ever need it
i used to have a ton of these lying around and got rid of them
isnt that the way it always isthis thing is more then up to the task
this is as good as the cord that come with any computer printer or tv
its a great replacement part for a good pricewhen after moving a treadmill i couldnt find the power cord my first efforts were devoted to locating the manufacturers website phone number mailing address all the while wringing my hands in despair that my costly indispensable machine had been rendered worthless due to the loss of a mere power cord which certainly had to be custommade to fit the opening designed for it by the makers of this aristocratic device  years ago i viewed all owners of treadmills as selfindulgent elitists
but while waiting for a company representative to answer one of my phone calls it suddenly occurred to me that my father had once purchased a power cord for an old tv set at a hardware store and with no regard even toward the make of tvso i looked on amazon instantly found something that looked promising the description universal was admittedly encouraging and in two days both the treadmill and i were back up and running
the pedestrian exchange in both senses of the word would no doubt have proven satisfying to anyone of any age generation class ethnicity or gender amounting to no less than the discovery of ones autonomy in a world of highpriced experts and gotcha specialists
moreover how reassuring it is whenever one discovers and comes into possession of the knowledge that previously had no doubt belonged to everyone but your own isolated outoftheloop lonely self
i hesitate to say whether the cord was more empowering to me or the treadmill
but dont be shocked if the product delivers what it promisestwice over
since writing the above ive discovered a company essential sounds products inc claiming its power cord is amazing innovative revolutionarythat after using it to supply power to for example an amplifier the cords owner will settle for nothing less one listen and nothing else will do
this possibility sort of blows my tribute to the universality of the common power cord but i remain to be sold on the new revolutionary product
if it converts my television set to smellovision for those of you old enough to remember or my kitchen toaster to a turbocharged forge suitable for alchemy experiments ill be persuaded
return for updatesargh
the esp the acronym for the manufacturer power cord begins at well over a hundred and the power strip at five hundred
i smell exploitation of musicians and gearheads who like athletes are sometimes willing to try anything for that winning edge
better to buy this belkin and if it bothers you paint it some other color and put an exorbitant price tag on it so people will think its one of those elitist ac
cordsi recently acquired an old desktop from a friend that didnt come with a power cord
this arrived quickly and works well at least for the week or so that i have been using it
i dont foresee any problemsive got a rabbit and she decided to 
worst part is it sat there for a while and i didnt know it
one weekend i decided to pratcticeeat my power cord for my amplifier was chewed up
what did i do
i hopped on amazon and bingo i found a new one that was a good deal bucks with shipping and i ordered a new one
two days later i was back in business
all i can say is thats what im talkin aboutnothing special here we needed a few spare power cables for some pcs and monitors that went missing and these fit the bill perfectly
no issues cheap and work great for various  lcds and xps  dell systemsexactly what i needed to get my lcd monitor working again
for buyers this is interchangeable with many desktop computers and other monitors so buy it with confidencewe bought a couple of these to replace our cords to our monitors because we had european cordsanyways these are just as good quality as the originals and dirt cheap here on amazon so it was a no brainer
perfectthis cord is amazing
it feels great and fits into most monitors
it is also made by belkin which means a lifetime warranty and quality product

i found these in red blue and yellow on amazon they are different colors and legnths
i wish they made ft in colors
that would be great
having the color allows you to know how long youre grabbingsimple need and this product delivered
great quality too and very heavy duty
connections are solid with no worry of accidental disconnectwhen i rearranged my office i discovered the power cord from my computer monitor would no long reach my battery backup
an extension cord was needed
i have used belkin products before and have always been satisfied so i didnt hesitate to order this online
i received it in only a few days and it worked perfectly
the plug ends fit snuggly and the picture on the monitor is as good as it was before i added the extension cord
and at a great price toosome belkin branded products are overpriced imho but this cable in particular is a stealhard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay  times the priceits an ethernet cable
its fifty feet long
it worksneed more
well i like that the plastic molding at the connectors doesnt slide down the cablestill need more
buy it if you need itit is an ethernet cable
what is there to be said
it is cheap and it works fineit fits
it works
it was priced right
i bought it
what more can i say about it
still need  more words sheeshgreat value if you just need a regular  ft ethernet cable and you dont care about the color etci saw the same exact cable at bestrip off oh i mean bestbuy and it was  bucks more

the brand is good and the quality is therecable was delivered promptly product was as described
used it to connect a second computer to a router  connections worked with no problems
connector ends appear to be sturdy  enough that i have no concerns about connecting and disconnecting this cable over time
considering the price this is a good valuewhat can i say
it was a great price on a  ft network cable and it works great
will buy again if neededi received this item in record time i dont know how these guys do the item for such a low price
why buy unknown makes names when you can get the real thing for less
thank you and i will surely buy again and reccomend
wish you every successjohni have the tools needed to make my own ethernet patch cables but for  i opted to just buy this  cable and be done with it
the cable is high quality and the connectors are strong and molded in
so for less than  cents a foot i have just what i neededafter receiving this cable i immediately plugged it into my router and my  and was up and running
just what we neede for xbox live
seems to be a high quality cablei have an old pc in the basement that runs as a file server instead of buying a wireless card i picked up this cable and ran it from my router up into the rafters and down into the front half of the basement  with cable to spare
it does just what it claims to do  gives you  feet of cat e cabling gloryits a  ethernet cable that i got for so low a price it bugged me for a bit i got over it
this cable is well made and works as describednow the seller on the hand was incredible
i got the item in three days brand newtheres nothing to itthe belkin network cable worked well right out the box
its solid construction produces good signal conduction
so far i have used it to download firmware to my bd player
great product
worth every pennythe cable connected my computer with the blue ray dvd player to give me access to netflix
it worked flawlesslydont go to best buy and pay that  markup
these cables are just as good if not better
you wont be disappointed by the quality and the length available here for a fraction of the retail price makes them a bargainfrankly the big box stores should be ashamed that they mark up items like this so much
the real quality and bargains are found online with items like this onei needed to connect a blu ray play to a wireless across the room
ft belkin cable worked out great for this task and now i get all my bd live stuffi set this up and have been using it for a while now
excellent quality and was able to run it throught the floor boards to my ps for a faster network connectionbelkin als foot rj cat e snagless molded patch cable worked great for my computer without any problems
we have a wireless internetconnection in the house now but i keep belkin als foot e snagless molded patch cablewhat can one say about an ethernet cable
this is well made and works properly when plugged in
reasonable value and i will order belkin cables againrarely do you find such a good deal on such a typically overpriced commodity
why should a simple cable thats used by billions of people be so unreasonably expense usually
well the answer is because they can get away from it
in this case i felt like i paid what i should pay
good price and the product was everything i needed
shippiing was pretty darned fast too
recommendedthis belkin quality cat is well worth the super almost rediculous low priceif your wired and need lengththis is the product for youeat crow radio shacknot much to say works as needed cheapwill buy again if need
recommendi just needed it to work connecting ps and router and it does  starsthis is the nd time ive used belkin cats i have some shorter ones and needed to change my router placement
ive also used belkin hdmi cables and i think fiber optic cable as well
ive never had any problem with their cables so far and their prices are reasonablei like the snagless feature and easy coiling for storage of this cable
i get it out when using my portable in a wired network and then coil it up and stow it in the casesome days it is better to just buy a good cable like this instead of putting your own ends on a bulk cable
very reasonably priced and a quality productthis was exactly what i needed
thanks for great product and great price
the product is sturdy and works welli ordered this as a spare so i have not used it yet
it does appear to be of good qualityit works as i expect an item from belkin to work
i needed a few extra cables to connect some home theater components to the switch box for the router these do the job quite wellshipped immediately to me this patch cable is worth way more than i paid
very good quality
excellent customer service as well
excellent value and productthese cables rock i got a bunch for my dorm room and they work perfectly and do what i need them to doi am pleased at how well this cable works
i use it to hook up my xbox to my router in order to get greater speeds for streaming video and it doesnt disappointi have no complaints pertaining to this cable
i particularly like the molded connector feature
its always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction
i doubt that will be the case with this cable from belkini also give kudos to the pricing
i simply cannot argue with  for a  foot catsecure snug fit great colors price is definetly right
get what you order at your door with minimal time usually  daysi bought this cable and it worked well
i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for products sold by belkinsworks very well
it has a nice length to it
for it to have been so cheap it really gets the job done
it doesnt fall in and out of the ethernet slot
it stays right in placedont care about color the cords are hidden
just like the high priced store cables
great packaging
why go to bb when you can get thesethese belkin network cables are wellmade and they do the job
of all the colors available the gray is the least expensive and blends in wellwhat can i say its a cat e cable and it works exactly as described no problems
for people who cant deal with making our own cables like methis item worked as expected and the price was lower than other suppliers
i have had no problems with this item thus farits not the prettiest cable in the world but its wellmade and it does what its supposed to do
i cant really ask for morethese belkin category e cables are well made
they are a good overall gauge thickness and the snag less ends are very beneficial
you may have experienced the problem of untangling a phone cord only to have the clip on the end bend over or worse yet snap off
the next time you use that cord it doesnt have anything to keep it in the wall
well what belkin did with these snag less cables was put twin ridges made out of a rubbery plastic that puts the snap in clip in a valley down below the ridges
so if you are untangling those ridges prevent other wires from snagging the clip
that is a great idea
that is not enough to make you want to buy the cable if it werent for the fact that it is overall a great cable
the sevenfoot length is good for a small patch area like when connecting your modem to a router or when your cable or dsl modem andor router are right next to your computerthe other nice thing is the price here at amazon on these cables
i went into the local nationally famous office supply and they were half again as much money
so overall it is a very nice combination
they also dont slow down your connection at all
i get the same exact connection speed when using the online speed tests when i use the foot or the foothighly recommended
buy it here at amazon and save the moneyim using the cable to connect a router to a desktop
it works finegood quality cable
i used it to hook my hdtv to my router and have had no issues
would buy againthe is an extremely cheap and one of the fastest commercial cables you can get
totally worth the money
look no where elsethis was just the right length color and price for us came in retail packaging and works fine for usthe quality of this cable from belkin seems to be good
they fit my router and are easy to install and remove
i have had trouble with some ethernet cables in the past so i bought  different sizes of belkin  and they all worked greati even tested the cable and it was fine
ill definitely buy these again in the futuregood enough price nice ends good sheathingi returned it because the network adapter which i purchased in conjunction with your product didnt function well with my hdtv and my modem
i would have kept it had i had another use for itsnagresistent would be more accurate a pair of flexible plastic ears guard the release lever that is the bane of normal cat cables but those ears can bend down so that the lever is unprotected
otherwise its fine and the price was right
i will buy more of these when neededthis cable was exactly what i needed and the quality price and speed of shipment was terrific
the type of cable was the perfect speed and complimented the rest of my system very well
all i can say is thankswhat can you say about a patch cable
i chose the belkin product because i have used belkin for many years with no failures of any of their products
the products are reasonably prices and belkin has always maintained a high level of qualitywhat can i say its a ethernet cable nothing special except for maybe the snagless ends
cable is wellbuilt from a reputable brand at an unbelievable price
great connection doesnt come loose from my router or the wall
also comes with a lifetime warranty so if anything goes wrong youre coveredconnects my pc and my xbox to the internet
i cant think of anything negative to wright works well for what it isgood cable
it is nothing special but does everything i need it topros cheaper than any brick and mortar
snagless design is nice
lets me get on the interwebzcons hasnt made me a blt
belkin should incorporate this into their next cat e designtldr buy itcat e cables are cat e cables for the most part
but quality does show when you compare the lowest quality products to the highest ones
this cable has solid sheathing and well built ends which will probably last for many years even in somewhat abusive situationsi got  of these cables in pink since amazon was offering them as an add on item for a discounted price
i chose pink because it was less expensive than any other color by at least a dollar
so far they have been working perfectly as most cables doi needed cable for specific purpose and and specific length and color
this was perfect and i would recommend to everyoneworks great feet just to warn you all unless you know for sure that the things youre connecting are gonna be close could be a little tight especially if youre going around a desk or somethinglooking for cables
go with belkin go with snagless
youll save yourself a lot of griefcame on time as expected  thank you amazon
works as expected  thank you belkin
what more is there 
plug it in once you see the price of these in stores you will appreciate the great prices here
ordered two of these and they work great and the snagless feature is a real plus
ordered two more to keep for back up
the different colors are nice also for identifying different computers or whatever you are usingit works and its  foot long
what more do you want from a  foot ethernet cable
wifi is great but there is no substitute for hardwiring in when i am playing starcraft iinot much to say about ethernet cables
i wanted a mix of different sizes as i rearranged my office and it was easy to find on amazoncomneeded a shorter cable to hook things up around the tv to a router
cable is good quality and works perfectly finethey are inexpensive flexible and work just fine
im just using them in mundane applications
dont know how theyd work in high speed applicationsits a cable it transfers data
not much else to say about it
the price was right for the length that it was and connects my new desktop to the routersimple made sturdy and hooks up my mac and ps   would recommend to anyone and inexpensive
great buy all aroundit does what its supposed to doand welli bought the pink ft cable and really like it
i took it to a workshop where no wireless signals were permitted radio telescope workshop obvious reasons for that necessity and everyone had ethernet cables and it was just a mess with all the cables and trying to figure out which went with which laptop etc
but thanks to this distinctive cable i didnt have to be concerned with any of those issuesor with my cable magically disappearing
which seemed to be the fate for a few of the many many mundane blue onesbelkin products are usually a good bet
this isnt complicated it works fine and is what i expected it to beused the patch cord to connect my modem to a switch then from the switch to two rokus
good price and fast shipmentim so sick of most local stores overcharging for cables
i always try to buy my cables online
sometimes you dont really know what you are getting though
this one worked perfect and i would not hesitate to buy again
good cable good pricethis ethernet cable works great and is cheap
i think this is a good size for most purposes
its not too long where it gets tangled up but not so short you cant use it
i like the way it latches in this is a nice feature compared to other cables i ownwe bought two of these basically because they were the cheapest  foot cable i could find on amazon
weve got other belkin equipment and have been happy with it
but to be honest i didnt expect much for that price
i figured it would be cheaply made toothpick size cable or the end locks would break right away
they were actually a pleasant surprise especially for how cheap they were being sold
cant complain a bitgreat cableno problems or issuesdoes what it needs to donot expensiveive bought many belkin products with no complaintsgreat cord
does what its advertised to do
cant beat the price and loved the color options specifically the purplethis cable was exactly what i needed and delivered very quickly
no question that you will be happy with the purchase  if you need a  cablei bought two of these to connect my tv and my surround receiver through an ethernet switch to my router
plugged them in everything worked netflix internet radio and never looked at them again
for that price you cant make them on your ownwhat you would expect from belkin
these are high quality cate cables and they work great to connect all my devicesworks great the snagless head is good when you are pulling through areas so you dont snap the clip off the endthis is a standard cable and does exactly what it is supposed to do
i am happy with the purchasethis cable works and is cheap
the tabs havent broken off after extensive use and the rubber shield covering that extends up onto them for the no snag feature might be responsible for that though it seems to be decent quality plastic not super brittle on the connector toobought the  ft gray cable good price works as advertised
the snagless feature is good to have since i have broken the plastic latch on other cables in the past
highly recommendgood quality for your money
you dont have to spend more for a similar prodduct as this one
 starswell its simply a cablenot much really to say about it other than it works and its size met my needs  having different colors helps that was the major reason behind this purchase  various cables to same location or even different locations i presume all have different colors making identifying them easier when necessary couple times now removing cables checking link lights etc
no problems since purchase thoughits a cat  cable good quality and seems to work well is kind of short though make sure you measure the run that you will be using it for before buyingit came on time and the cable worksneeded a couple of cables for a project i was working on and once again amazon had the best price compared to most of my local merchants
these worked and are still working great for my application
thanks amazonahhh its a network cable works as expected would give it  stars if it could talk to me but since it cant  stars will have to do
loldoes the job i got it for at a stellar price
no complaints
buying from amazon saved me money
i would have paid a lot more had i gone to radio shack or best buythis cable was exactly what i needed and the quality price and speed of shipment was terrific
the type of cable was the perfect speed and complimented the rest of my system very welli bought these because they are purple
good quality cables for a good price
really though they are purple and thats why i bought themthe cable works as advertised
the connection is fast and gives me no reason to be dissatisfied
a cable at this price cannot be beatenwhat can you say it is a cat cable has quality molded connectors works and was cheap
i carry  with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths and belkin always delivers with quality cablesthis cable came at a good price and works flawlessly
i used it to increase my download speed by using the ethernet connection instead of the muchslower wireless
what more can you ask forworks beautifully
now i get to sit back and bask in the glory that is fast internet service from my modem to my routeryou could have paid much more money for the exact same cable
this cable works as well as one you might pay two to three times the price
recommend the product and the vendorworks great it is just ethernet cable
nothing special but perfectly fine as long as reasonably priced
seems to be well built and solidits cable
it works
it wasnt expensive
why do i need so many words for such a simple review
one more  word arghits ethernet cable
its the right size
and it didnt cost an arm and a leg
the connections are well made
would buy againbought these to connect my router to all my home theater stuff
rasberry pi etc
love the vibrant off beat colorsits a jumper
cant say much more than that
works
nice quality
went from switch to internet ready device
okim guessing the snagless refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable
these tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable at least in tight places where youre limited in how you can twist your hand
meh no big deal
the price is good the black looks really darn good and they do their job just fineit does what its supposed to do and it does it well
fits perfectly and the casing is high qualityi bought this to link my cable router to my bluray player for streaming video
works great seems to be a high quality cableit is nice having a  foot cable as opposed to the usual  foot
it worked out perfect with how i routed the cable to the ps
looking forward to more great shopping on amazonfast shipping and this is a good quality item
simple to install does what it is designed to do with no complicationsafter always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables i bought a few of these
they work great and have nice clip protectors
handy to have a few extras of these arounduse it with my new docis  modem and wireless router works like a charm gives me great speeds
does exactly what its advertised to doim not sure theres a whole lot you can say about network leads but ill try anyway it worked the covering on the cable wasnt cracked anywhere the rj connectors were intact and undamaged i liked the grey it really brought my room togetheryeah thats about all folksmiddle of no where
my wireless card went out
at that time i did not even know what an ethernet cable was
however it got me up and going
with simple instructions off of youtubethere is not much to say about cable it works or not this e cable worked for my purpose it delivers my full broadband speed of mbps to my devicesbasic wire
works
too pricy for a basic part made up of wiring and plastic
not much more to saythe price on these cables is great
so much cheaper than most stores and they come in many colors so that you can use multiples
packaging is easy to use and completely frustration free
would buy againthen why do you have to spend  more for it in a store than online
great quality and priceyet another example of belkin getting it right
this is not a unique lengthits the right length
printers or other devices that are not immediately adjacent to all the other equipment need this length
another great product at a good price by belkini bought this and plugged it in and have been using it without issues ever since
id buy this againwhat more can i say than it works and was inexpensive
i generally get my cables from monoprice but this is good toono issues with this cable at all
the ends hold firm in my switch and have survived about a half dozen unpluggingsrepluggings
the molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible
will buy again if need morethe product just works just fine
one thing youll notice about quality ethernet cables is where the insulation stops on the ends of the cable
if youre cable is filled with the plastic on the endslike this one youre getting a pretty good quality cableexceeded the use for what  i needed  very good cord for the price  the e is for extra heavy duty wire gaugehooks up in a snap and doesnt come out of the plug unless you need it to the end plug is made with very good quality thanks for sending it to me the way you did  i received it one day before the promised dategood wire to connect my roku to router
it enhances the speed as it is fast as compared to wireless connectioni bought this product after doing a lot of price comparisons and reading reviews
i am satisfied with it
the cable is of good quality
i use it to connect my wired trendnet broadband router to my laptopsnot much to review here
they were inexpensive cat e patch cables
they work just fine
construction was fine
i would have no problem buying these again if i needed more patch cablesseems to work fine and quality is comparable to products from electronics stores
this was half the price so that makes it a great bargainthis cable does what it is supposed to do
it works
what more can be said
it is well made and performs to specsneeded this for my computer and it works just as i need it too
nothing more nothing less
would suggest to anyone with a computerthe snagless part is really nice
most any problems ive ever had end up being broken ends and this type seems to solve that problemits hard to review products that work as expected
a  foot cable for less than  cant be a bad deal anyway
this works as expected and was very inexpensive
gratefuli love the price and free shipping with prime this cable was a great buy and if i ever need another cable i will buy this one i love the different ranges in length also
all around  stars on this producti bought  of these so i could connect everything around my tv to the internet
xbox  playstation  dvr and a computerthese cables are great they are high quality and have sturdy connectors
they are gigabit cablesi stream p mkv files from my laptop to my xbox  via windows media center wireless n does not cut it but these cables do the jobeven though i doubt i will need speeds over mbps i like having gigabit cables and i like these cables better than the cheap blue ones on amazon
the cheap blue cables have weak connectors in my experience and have broken offi would definitely recommend this cablei actually ordered this belkin ethernet cable for its certified status and did receive a new packaged belkin ethernet cable
plus the price was the lowest ive found for this brand name cable
of course its working fine
its manufacture and durability appear among the best
dont get me wrong i use and am happy with the generics tooonly difference seems to be the thicker construction of this belkin brand
i expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cableit is as advertised and works extremely well
construction is above the standard
before there all gone get one nowgood network cable
it looks reliable and made of good quality plastici wish i got a longer one thoughwhat can i say
it does what its supposed to
no drama
for applications requiring a cable more than  feet but less than  you know that but i needed the extra words to fulfill review guidelinesi love purple and this is really purplethe cord is good quality and i am happy have gotten a few more sincethey work just like they shouldalways go for the snagfree design so the little clippy thing doesnt break off due to your carelessnessi dont no if their is much to say about a ethernet cable but it feels like it has a solid build qualities
i have had no problem with the cable
i would recommend this item to anyonethis is a quality product at a great price
works like a charm
should last for a very long timedoes what it is supposed to do with no snagging among cabling
quality product with sturdy construction and flexibility and a nice gray colori ordered this cable to replace a nice red  footer that will work with my lan hookups but notmy line  spider amp to peddle connection
go figurethe cable works great and i dont have to use the  cable line  sent me  feet
i ordered three of these as every once and a while i need a shorty to run from wall connection to router or routerwall to computerit works great and i have posted a photo of it as one reviewer said he got a fake so this is what it looks like in the packagei really like the snagless feature on this one
ive broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables
i think this will be much better protected
the length is good
i can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop and the cord reaches but its not so long to be cumbersome when im working on the deskjust after buying a new computer dell i realized that it would be a good idea to replace my modem to computer cat cord
when the cords arrived i connected them then logged on
could not believe the difference
i was using an older blue cord that i picked up from a family member
i ordered this cable because i wanted a longer cable but was really happy and pleasantly surprised  with the increased speed
we have sbc dsl elite and everything is so much faster with the new belkin cat  i recommend this cat cableits a cat  cable you use it for networking
there isnt much to say besides that i suppose but its very good for the low pricethere is nothing bad to say about this cable
i bought three at once
they arent the exact ones shown in the picture or at least the ends look different but they still have the snagless design albeit a slightly different one
still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable
i used it with my trendnet ethernet switch with no issues yet whatsoeverits ethernet as advertised
snag protectors work well
no complaints here would buy again
 more words required required requiredsnagless cables at an affordable price
just what i needed
the connector head was solid and felt like it had a good build qualityits hard to go wrong with a belkin product
they always do what theyre supposed to do and for a reasonable price
its hard to be too picky about a cable that plugs into your modem and computer but it does seem to stay unkinkedno complaints about this cable
functions perfectly and is exactly as described
used for connecting desktop computer to an ethernet switchit is a great cable and easy to tell witch one goes where i highley recomend it to everyone it will not snag on anythingi bought several five of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expectedwhat can you say
it works perfectly and is of high qulitytheres not a lot to say about this cable but ive got to try since theres a minimum word requirement for this review  the cable is good its the right length it worksalways go cheap for digital cables
i found this same cable at walmart for ten times the price
no difference what so everhey its just a cate cable and it seems to work as intended
i didnt test it to see if it would work at gigabit speeds which a cate should but it works fine to connect my networkattached color laser printer to a local ethernet switchnew does the job and arrived on time
why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store
amozon is the place for all your cable needssolid well built product
does the jobnow is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country
hate word length requirement when a few simple ones will dovery good quality cable for a good price
i bought this for my desktop computer and they work great
the clip is not flimsy like most cablesi have a htpc and even though its rare sometimes i do need to use a keyboard with it
i had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit tv viewing area that i wanted to use
got this cable and routed it from the pc around the back of the tv and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing onthis cable is not available in any store in our area so big thanks to amazon for making unusual items like this readily available to everyone everywhere
keyboard cables are too short and this was exactly what i wanted
being tipical belkin quality is obvious immediately  it works perfect
does not have that flatspot to plug into tower like the keyboard does so i marked the missing pin space with a majic marker on the cord to make finding the proper alignment easy to find when you want to plug it in againneeded to extend keyboard for older style desk
six feet was clean simple and perfect fit
cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs upthis was a must have for my windows  keyboard
i enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to usegreat cable
works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes
belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff toothis is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard
most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem
you may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so fari needed this for my old computer which i use when i want to pretend its still the s
i had a slight fear that the extra length  my keyboards already long cable plus this one  would cause problems with the strength of the signal but everythings fine
and how sweet it is to finally be able to sit at my desk far from that computer without a keyboard cable stretched across my monitor screenthis extension fits into my older pcs ps port better than the cable from the keyboard
the connection is snug but not too tight
it works just as well on my new selfbuilt win  computer
ive got an old keyboard that is really great so im using it alternately for both computerswork as they are supposed to
i sit about  or  feet away from my monitor so these are perfect
i go through to many batteries in wireless keyboards and mouses so this has saved me tonsif you want a longer cord on an older nonusb keyboard this extension cable works greatkeyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on itits belkin
what more to say
nice tight connections and it works
probably will have only wireless mice soon but this was handy when i needed it and it didnt give me any problemsi have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer
i would definitely purchase again
thanksi use this to connect an old ps keyboard to my htpc and it works fine
i bought this to replace a generic brand that wore out so hopefully this name brand will be betterthe configuration of my office made it impossible for my cpu and monitor to be close enough together to use the existing cables
so i purchased these extension cables and they work beautifully
they were the exact same product as sold in stores for  times the cost and there is no loss of function
i would recommend this product to others needing just a little more length in those cablesagain and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store
we have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts
they are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery
i am a pc gamer and play on a  in my living room
i had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord
more then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living roomdont quite understand what i need to say about this product its an extension cord it extends the distance between the motherboard and the keyboard andor mousenot much to say
belkin makes good products in general and this is one of them
i have purchased several of these for home and at the office
they work fine for both mouse and keyboard
i still use one of them in conjunction with a usb to ps adapter for a usb mouse too because that way i can use the ps mouse port on my older computer and free up one of my usb ports which i dont have enough ofand its screw handles are ribbed and very easy to graspnicely constructedwell built
thumb screws are very ergonomic
i use these cables with standard external modems like the usrobotics k faxmodems
good value for the moneywhat more can you say
it works like expected
the cable didnt appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectlythis is a decent cable for the price
the connection of the cable to the connector is rugged and will resist breaking easily
cable is well insulated and connectors are of typical belkin quality
have used this in several environments including in the lab setting with satisfactory performancejust what i needed to allow my users to connect to our cnc machines from their laptops
great price i couldnt make them for this pricethis is basically just a de to db adapter
it has the normal rs specified pinouts on both ends so it should work with almost anything
it will not work with things that use a proprietary pinout such as point of sale pos machines
we use these for factory hardware and label printersi bought these almost three years ago
but you know what
theyre still hanging in my bar putting out good music
well i play the good music
these just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible
but thats beside the point
look theyre not like super bassheavy subs
theyre just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar
they get plenty loud and they look plenty good
i have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them
until they get their damn faces rocked off
should have paid attention suckasi bought these speakers for less than  and am very impressed with their quality
i put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound the patio is about x
if you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside this is your pairmy brother and i bought a set of klh  speakers   or so years ago for my father to replace some old larger speakers in his house and they are the best value speakers i have ever seen
we liked them so much we got a second set to replace the other set of speakers on his stereo
these little guys really deliver a great range of sound in a small package
its not suprising to me that klh is still making this exact model this many years later
you cant find another  way sound speaker at this price
also they are durable and are weather resistant
i dont recommend leaving them on a patio in a monsoon or a blizzard and the black doesnt make good friends in bright sun but you can mount these to the porch or patio roofoverhang and leave these out in damp weather with no loss of wear or sound at least not as of yet
the more i looked around at different facilities with pa or sound systems outdoors the more i have noticed these speakers being utilized
so if you have just a few bucks and want to some aged speakers this is the perfect little set to get
everybody thinks bigger and pricer is better but i have to argue that these speakers have done their job superbly and thats why my dad still uses them  years later
this  set of klh speakers are actually identical speakers to the  models but run a  watt range whereast the  series runs  watt range
so dont break the bank if you want a set of small speakers i think you will be suprised
note as with many small speakers if you are a bass sound fan then you might want to buy a subwoofer but these do a fine job at normal rangeto me kensington is a name that project trust
this was priced right and works great
good cord lengthi love this
it comes with matching tags
we always have a mess of cords over by our tv
between all the components it is iimpossible to tell what is whatnot anymore
you just tag it with the matching color up by where you plug it in
i love this and it comes with a great warranty which also sold me
worth the little bit extra imoi have these all over in my house
they work great
i had one for many years that i paid over  for but i got my moneys worth for sure
so when i was able to see these on amazon for less money i was happy
they work well they allow you to plug up many things and move freely
the cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job
i would recommendpurchased six of these for use in our store
they are durable with an  foot grounded cordamazons  product description indicates  joules protection   model has  joules   clamping voltswill certainly purchase kensington surges againthis is a great power strip
i use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it doesnt matter how big the plug next to it is it does not interferei also really enjoy the design and colors
having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my bookthis surge protector is super cute and can handle your tv and other big items
i bought two of these just because its awesome looking
lmaothis is a brilliant product
its so helpful to not have to tug and pull and guess which cord is which
i love that they added tape so you just put matching tape on each end of the cord and pull the cord into the coordinating plugi got this strip because i was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer
this did just thatwith two very young children our outings can be very unpredictable
time is tight too
the motorola s have been a great time saver
sometimes we  split up in the mall
one of us goes to do some shopping while the other  has fun with the kids
we dont have to worry about setting up a time and  place to meet up
its easy to ask a question or changemake plans from   mile away
we use it on hikes and while walking around the neighborhood
theyre also great when you are travelling with more than one carthe  range is supposed to be about  miles
it can differ depending where you  areeverything ive said is a good reason to by any way radio
why did  i choose this model even though it costs a lot more than some of the other  onestheyre compact
even more compact than the the s that take  regular batteries
their size makes them easy to bring along anywhere
they  also have a removeable belt clip
clip them on your pants or belt or remove  the clip and they slip easily into your pocket
theyre rugged
the s  survived drops onto pavement and gallons of baby drool
they have   channels and  privacy codes
if you go somewhere where there is a large  crowd you will run into other people with radios
the extra channels help  you find a quiet channel
however we rarely have to change  channelsweve had ours for almost  years now and they have been very  usefulif you have children who like to roam then the motorola talkabouts are essential equipment
i have used them to keep in touch with my children when they have played in different soccer fields when they ride their  bikes in the park when camping picnicing and hiking
the units are easy  to use even for a yearold
it makes them feel important too so they  willingly keep in touchi have found the talkabouts to easily withstand  the rigours of active preteen boys and the reception has been good even  in builtup areasbattery use is reasonable the units are tough and  easy to useany parent will find a use for thesemy husband young daughters and i own horses and trailride at least once a week
santa brought us four of these lovely little twoways this year at christmas and i couldnt be more pleased
weve had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews although we dont ride on mountaintops and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand not to mention the cool factor
the radios are durable weve dropped them in snowbanks had them grawed on by curious horses and thumped around in saddlebags
theyre certainly useful we know if one of us gets separated from the others theyll be able to radio in and figure out where we are
and for what we use them for theyre just perfect
we looked at a bunch of gps handhelds and decided we didnt need anything quite that high end
for the average family who hikes or skis trailrides or just goes to the mall of america these are the perfect belt accessory
go for itfabulous product  works great  highly recommend  have used on my friends boat and it is great when we are on shore and need some one to come retrieve us  also works great on the boat that is  feet longiomega zip  drive parallel portthis device has been in use since the mids
it allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port which should be defined as bidirectional or epp
for best results you should run the parallel port accelerator program when the unit is connected
computers have a limit on the number of ide devices and desktop computers have a limited number of bays
the disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the mb limit
this device must be connected when all power is off like with a parallel port printer
backing up a small amount of data is not a problem but large amount of data files will run slowly
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip devicethe users manual warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega copy machine program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega format function
use short format to delete all data on an iomega disk
the long format repairs a drive with errors converts from another format or removes all passwords
write protection protects against writing over data a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as nonremovable so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the details
most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit
the manual offers suggestions if this doesnt workparallel port drives have their drive letters assigned after the hard drive
another parallel port unit can be connected to the first daisy chaining
this changes the drive letters assigned to cdroms
a usb drive has its drive letter assigned after the cdrom drive letters
both units have been proven useful over time
will the data on a disk survive for over a decade
not with some floppy disks
few hard drives survive  years of daily use
all your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to zip drives or other media
zip drives like floppies should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat
cds can be damaged by high heat
zip disks are reusable replacing data does not decrease the size
a cd disk consumes space when a file is replaced
both can have labels
some say zip drives are obsolete but not as long as it works for you
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by a different systemto test the status of a used zip disk
 right click on the drive select properties
 select the iomega tab after support was installed
 select diagnostics then close after the green light
 select more info on the disk type note the disk life status and the format life status
percentages lower than about  are not good
 a long format can improve the life status statisticsif your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive add new hardware wizard select the hardware from the list scsi controllers iomega iomega parallel port interface then finishi have a  that i use this drive on
i am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port
i had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a zip drive but it seems to work about the same  speed as an atapi drive i had preinstalled on my pii mhz
the price is  right for zip drives
dont bother with the  mb drive  disks are more  and not enough people have the drives yet that support themi have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive  my universitys graphics computers have zip drives the local kinkos have zip drives in their computers my parents even have a zip drive now
its a nice accepted standard and for the price the disks read fast and work well unlike   floppies no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me
zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your shirt pocket without  damagethe strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the  mb  superdrive which is a drive that is backwardscompatible with  mb  traditional floppies so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it
a couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow iomega zip out of the picture but  superfloppies havent really caught onin terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead and there are other advantage besides transfering  files such as printer sharing and web sharingnote
i think the zip   is more functional for the price than the  zip
for backing up  really large files the best thing these days is a cd writer or rewriterim a mac user but i also have a windows pc in my office
my workplace has over  employees and the majority of them are on windows while i am one of  people in the organization that consistently uses a maci am sent files all the time via the network groupware email system
i never wanted to hook my mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a novell system so i never got the mac version of the software to connect my mac fully to the networkso when someone sends me a file via groupwise i copy the attachment onto my zip disk and then eject that disk and put it in my mac to work on the file
not the most efficient way to go about things but this mb iomega zip drive hasnt failed me once in the past  yearssince the mac os can read both mac and pc zip disks i use pc formatted disks and move them back and forth from windows the parallel drive to mac the factory installed mb drive all day longzip disks can hold an equivalent of about  floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies
my only gripe is that iomega does not make these drives with an onoff switch even if your computer is off for a week youve got to unplug your zip drive if you dont want it to eat up electricity
honestly i doubt that a little zip drive that isnt spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month but its a waste nonetheless
this one gripe wasnt enough of a drawback to take a star away from the  star rating im giving this gizmo
its dependable its fast and zip is an industry standard
hats off to iomegathe zip is a minimum necessity for todays larger and larger file formats  mpeg mp and multiple images files can easily run up to mb
ive used the zip since its inception when it knocked old syquest mb  drives out of business about  years ago
the size and convenience is why  there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate  readwrite capabilitythere are definite pluses and minuses
some will  say get a cdrw drive  but burning a cd is definitely not as immediate  as a zip
the parallel port is a major bummer because of the thruspeed
but those of you who are not major speed demons wont be disappointed  compared to a floppy
the zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can  connectoutput to other peripheralsiomega cut cost on the power  onoff its always on when plugged in
but really the overall design is  very good  you can place it flat or vertical
even though the thick  parallel cord may tend to twist the main unitthere are a plethora of  other iomega choices
and i would really ask yourself if you are planning  on usb or scsi  each are noticeably faster
on the plus side the mb  format is so common in print shops university labs and copy places that  you cant go wrong
plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than  the mb
seriously think about your file formats
if you plan to do a  lot video  youll need to go with a jaz
and you can get these  refurbished for about the same cost and hold gig
the only barrier to  entry is the scsi necessity and the extra cost of disks
overall the  zip has been a major workhorse for me  back and forth between work and  homemac and pc msnt
it has performed flawlesslybest buy
excellent quality
thinest case aroundif you have a palm v or vx this is the case to getthe vx is a  classy looking palm
the case makes the vx into a porche
the combination  of the two is terrific performance and looksthere is one problem  with turning the power but a software hack fixes thisa great gift  idea for an intelligent businessman or woman
the more you use these t  devices the more you will come to depend on themif you want to use  this as a wallet it is a good option
i like to keep my wallet trimmed  down without a lot of junk
this is not a real wallet so you cant  accumulate junk in herethe palm vx complements this in that you can  quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in  your walletauto records expenses etc
and toss those out or if you want  to keep them dump in a monthly file folderi strongly recommend the  combination of this wallet and the vxas a heavy user of my palm which i access dozens of times a day the palm slim leather case is perfect for my needs
i prefer it over other cases for the following reasonsthe first is portablity
i take my palm everywhere with me even to the little boys room
and with the cases slim size my palm fits easily into my front pants pocket
carrying my palm in my shirt pocket is also an option
but since my company switched to business casual attire i no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work
hooray
the second reason is convenience
with the palm rail system the unit is held securely
and when i need to sync the case slides off cleanly the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or velcro holding methods of other productsthe third reason is protection
the rigid cover is slightly padded and the loop closure is very secure
before adopting this case i once used another cover  without a loop closure  which failed to protect my palm when i accidentally dropped it in the street while i waited on the curb for a cab
the loop closure is also easy to open so access to my palm is not restrictedmy last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards
i put my business cards a whole slew of them in the large inside pocket and i put my kids doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots none of which i want to carry in my wallet which is already filled with plenty of other stuff
since my palm is always with me im never without a business card so i never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors i meet
as a comparison many of the hard cases are very stylish
but since they cant carry business cards they arent really adequate for my needs
for a great combination of style and function thats perfect for a heavy palm user like me  the palm slim leather case is ideali got this case because i had two needs
i wanted to protect my palm v from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket but i didnt want to significantly increase its size and weightthis case fits both bills  nicely
the added bulk and texture of the leather holds the palm in your  pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls and when  it does fall even if it lands on a corner the screen doesnt crack
just  what this doctor orderedi use the pockets to store a couple of cards  nothing more
works like a charm
the clasp is sort of odd just a tab of  leather slipping into a buckle
a snap or velcro would have been nicer  but so far it does hold closed on its ownthe leather smells nice and  has been wearing well
the little palm logo embossed on the front is sort  of cute too
overall im happy with this case and the price is certainly  rightiomega zip  portable usb drivethis unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box
it uses a separate power supply
the model number is zipusb
it can operate either horizontally or vertically like a floppy drive
a device that connects with a usb cable requires windows  or later
you should use the software eject command to remove a zip disk in windows  because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out
the iomega software should be installed in windows  instead of the builtin supportthe users manual warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega copy machine program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega format function
use short format to delete all data on an iomega disk
the long format repairs a drive with errors converts from another format or removes all passwords
write protection protects against writing over data a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as nonremovable so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the detailscomputers have a limited number of ide devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical
replaceable  mb zip disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology
but the  mb zip disk is almost as universal as the floppy disk when you have a parallel port drive for older systems
the zip disks reuse deleted space unlike a cd whose space is consumed when you replace files
falling prices for cd discs solved that problem
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by a different systemto test the status of a used zip disk
 right click on the drive select properties
 select the iomega tab after support was installed
 select diagnostics then close after the green light
 select more info on the disk type note the disk life status and the format life status
percentages lower than about  are not good
 a long format can improve the life status statisticsthis is the perfect product to back up file photos vieo clips mps
great performance fast transfer rate not very noisy at all comparing to an ls i own
i recently bought a zip mb and so far its get my thumbs up
full compatibility with the mb disks
if you want a portable storage device put your money on a zip drive
cdr amp cdrw media are great
the only drawback is the media being used over and over
cds arent a very reliable comparing to cartridge disks
cartridge disks are more reliable and last longer in the rewrite processes of everyday backups of your files
and keep in mind that the zip drives or less expensive and are easily transported anywhere easy to install and work with
amines been working flawlessly since i bought it in early  i understand the newer models are buspowered
if for some reason you cant have a power strip thats a concern but i do wish the ac adapter was smallergotta love the way it shoots noniomega zip disks half way across the room tooi recommend this drive for lowcost low demand storage and backup
now if only zips would come down in pricei had backed up a legacy computer on zip disks and stored them away
i now use thumb drives and cdrom
when i needed some old material from the old computer i could not read the zip disks without getting a new drive
this convenient usb zip drive was just what i needed
it was shipped promptly and in excellent condition
it saved my life on this occasionmy zip drive finally went out
it worked for at least ten years
current usb drives have more capacity and are a lot cheaper
one can buy a mb usb drive for  dllsi purchased a zip to keep from loosing filesif system crashednot realizing the zip would stop working first
found a refurbished more updated with usb and i am in heaven
now i can travel with ititem was delivered on time and in good condition
all the essential parts were in the package power cord and usb cablethe zip drive works great
im very satisfied with the productsince i was out of internal bays and i still needed a zip drive for my pc i purchased the portable usb model and it has worked just fine
no glitches in either the installation or operation
i dont quite get the  translucent blue case oh yeah it works with the mac too but other than  that no complaints
now that is high praise indeed these daysif youre like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free pcmcia slot this is an excellent value
leave it in your slot all the time it wont have an effect on your system when the cf card isnt in but it will permanently add a cf slot to your systemthis means that you can dispense with the cameratocomputer cable and just plug the card into the slot
when you do it will be recognized as a removable disk kind of like a syquest or zip disk and show up in your quotmy computerquot view or mac desktop and maybe this is how nikon view works anyway pop up your digicam softwarethis really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptopi plugged this adapter into my new dell laptop and it brought up my compactflash card as an additional hard drive in windows  no software or additional drivers requiredi was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive
truly amazing
all peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to usecf readers with usb cords
why bother
say goodbye to those bothersome cords
this cf adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer portable
one little adapter allows you to plug in your compact flash cards for quick and easy reading
i bought this item when i purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing
its so simple to use lightweight compact  and incredibly inexpensive
how simple
plug your cf card in one end plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the cf card just like it was another drive
how sweet is thati use a viking mb compactflash card in my canon s digital camera
simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the pcmcia slot on my mac tibook automatically launches iphoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop
much faster and certainly more elegant than carrying around cables and using the camera battery
highly recommendedit works fine under windows me  and xp because you dont need drivers i read a bad review for this item and let me tell to the autor or you have an old windows version or  or you need to contact support but not for this device you need suport for the cf card developer because this its just an adapterits faster than usb readersmax mbps and of course really more faster than cable connection from the devicembps the speed limit its the speed of youre cf cardmore than x its greatthis adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc
the only problem i have with it relates to the overall length of the card
they should have made it  inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the pc card slot
when inserted it is quotflushquot with the pcthis is a great little piece of hardware
i have used mine in both a dell latitude running winxp and an apple ti running mac os x it is the only way i transfer pictures now
much easier to carry than a usb cable plus it is faster does not use up the batteries on the camera and just flat out works perfectlyhere is how i use it i take my picutres duh  remove the cf card from the camera and insert it into this adapter
then i insert it into the laptop
under both windows and mac the cf card appears as a removable drive on the computerunder windows i navigate through a couple of folders to where the pictures are stored and copy them to a folder on my hard drive
on the mac iphoto automatically opens up because i have told iphoto to startup automatically when a camera is connected and it gets ready to transfer the pictures
i can then tell it to copy the pictures to my photo library and delete the originals
it does just that
then on the mac and pc i tell the operating system to eject the drivedevice then i can pop the adapter out of the computer
of course you can pop it out whenever you want but you will definitely risk something bad better to eject it the proper way
i can transfer a full  mb flash card to my computer is a minute or so
fast enough that i havent timed itso i would highly recommend this to anyone who uses cf media with a laptop
it is the way to gothis device was the second wind my old panasonic digital camera needed
i connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow no usb cable so i tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly
i needed a way to download the pictures from the cf card to the computer
now i can download in seconds what usually took hoursthis compact flash adapter works great
all you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your slot and bam
it is also much faster for me then hooking up my digital camera to the computer using a usb cord and acdc adapter saves on batteries
faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading
i can highly recommend this product i am very happy with iti use it with my ibm thinkpad to download pictures from a nikon coolpix  with a mb cf card
this adapter works great
plugged it in and winxp automatically recognized it as e drive
this adapter worked in win and win as well
great price and buying it new is actually cheaper than usedthis is a fabulous device for transferring large volume of data from my handheld jornada  to my laptop and viceversai bought this targus cln  traditional leather case through amazon with data vision as the seller
why did i mention that
because this case has recently undergone a refresh as they put it which means they redesigned it
the newer version which is what i received from data vision has way more pockets and space than the much older original version
i contacted another large supplier and they in fact had the older version and were charging more money
you will notice that it is selling for much more from all of the other suppliers
the new one is greatthis model unlike some of the competition is all leather on the outside
lesser models have leather faces on them but then they have plastic sides
there is plenty of room for everything in here
i have a  inch laptop and i can store the large section of the ac adapter in the same section
they even have an adjustable dividing flap in that section so it does not touch your laptop
the remaining detachable plug in cord of the adapter goes in the compartmentalized section of the case with all of the other items like wireless mouse cable connector for myvantec lapcool  lpc foldable notebook cooler with port hub blackwhich sits neatly under the laptop since folded up for transport it only takes up  inches of space
ths of one inch so this case has ample room for my hp gus laptop as well as the  inch cooler sitting underneath
with the velcro secured tie down strap nothing movesthere are more compartments on the other side as well
the pictures illustrating this case are a mish mosh of both series
the one i received from data vision the newer refresh version as they call it is the one you see in photo number  the featured photo
if you notice the second picture and other pictures are a different case the older version
you can easily see the difference because the older one has a long pad on the strap and the new one has an oval adjustable one
by visiting targuss website you can see photos of the new one in its completeness
i would upload those photos but i think it is smart to leave the mix since that is what some of the suppliers are sellingthis case has a definite luxury about it
they have their top cases going for  times as much but this one really fills the bill nicely its executive material without going over the top
hey for  or  dollars less than the data vision price you can buy an all plastic oneoverall this case is well designed and comfortable
highly recommendedproduct shipped fast and looks exactly as it did in the photo
would definitely purchase from this seller againthere are better cases on the market but i couldnt find one close to the price of this one
holds the pc snuggly and there is lots of gadget space
great deali travel with my notebook in my backpack
i have had three of these things
you have to read the instructions to set the combination correctlythey all have worked well and they never have changed the combination on me spontaneouslythe newer model has the same features but uses aaa bats and not a v which the old one used
it is thiner than the old model also
i like the blinking red light when ever i arm it
i run the cable through my zipper on my backpack and leave in strapped to the desk or chair in my hotel room
it  creates a shrill loud alarm if you set it for this feature when the unit is moved
there are two sensitivities
you can set it to only alarm if the cable is cut
yes you can cut the cable with a good set of wire cuttersso it would not stop anyone determined to take your notebook from you and had strong intentions to do so
it will stop someone from just grabbing it and trying to runi also really like the little gadget in the photolower right hand corner of photo it fits into the security hole of my notebook very snugly
the cable of the defcon can go through the hole of this gadget and you can just lay it next to your notebook and it will start to scream as soon as the notebook is moved it does give you a  second warning before screaming with a loud chirp sound so you can disarm it
go to targus website and check it out
i dont work for them
i do believe they sell a quality little alarm
it is not fort knox  it is a lot better than nothing
blinking light and siren deters the common dumb criminal not on drugs or really crazyfrom taking your computer
its should be just one of a series of methods you have to secure your notebook not the only oneits nice for travel
you can even hang the thing on a door knob and know if someone opens the door
its a motion alarm with a blinking red light
the number of blinks tells you how it is armed
i recommend itgreat lock for the price
if you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for youi bought a defcon  pa u in  it works perfectly x  years
it has no key but works w a combinationi have just bought another for another computeri needed three of these for field employeeseasy to setup a memorable code and attach to the laptopi would recommendi dont know why there are so many negative reviews i bought the combo lock and the key lock and they both work great for me
i take them to starbucks all the time and no one touches my laptop
this is a great buy worth your moneylike this key lock as i always had problems with the combination locks
the length of this is not too long and i did not have problems with chemical smells that some people have mentioned
i noticed that the review section for this product had people reviewing the combination lock
i had the combination version the combination changed and i had to pry it off my computeri now have three of these and have to highly recommend this item
i use it for my computer as well as for my tv centeri purchase this item in amazon
which i purchase a lot of things in amazon
this item arrive on time it is so nice and convenient to have at home or if you are travelling to take it with you in order to charge all the things that we have now days that have to be chargeit is just like the description say
easy to set up you can put on the wall if you like
or on the floor
i am living for overseas and it is going to be very convenient item to haveluz m brownapc which by the way is american power conversion not american power conservation as amazoncom currently shows it has always been serious about clean power
this is no ordinary surge protector
it has more  heavyduty protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than  youre ever likely to see
but what i like is the intelligent layout of the  outlets  with my adsl modem i now have three huge wall warts to deal  with
the prot handles them well and manages another smaller one in the  top tier of outlets
a large green light lets me know its working
and the  switch guard is removable  if you want to be able to turn this unit on  and off with your toe apc made that possible and they call out the  feature in the instructions
you can spend  for a much less capable  power station or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your  stuff
apc delivers the latter with this unitthere are other power surge protectors cheaper and smaller
after my belkin protector broke after a direct lightning hit on my house i purchased this item
the equipment i had plugged into the belkin model did not survive the direct hit
the other model of apc i had did protect my imac
i will never pruchase another belkin again
belkin is cheaper but you get what you pay for
apc are built better feel more solid then the cheap plastic belkin protectors arefits great under a small desk and plug is flat against the outlet saving more room
on off switch in front also easily accessable
fills need for smaller footprint surge arresti just replaced the garmin gps iii which i had in my truck with the  colormap
the screen is much easier to see in a variety of lighting  conditions
the colormap also changes some of the field colors depending  on the time of day to provide ever greater visibility
this unit is really  designed to be used in a vehicle and provides features to that effect such  as a readout stating which road your currently on
this is much easier than  trying to find the road label while youre driving alongthe rom maps  cover most major areas of the us but for true coolness you need a memory  cartridge and a copy of the metroguide cd rom
the areas in this software  are huge so i suggest going with the  meg cart and skipping the  meg  one
for example northern virginia takes about  meg and the dc metro area  is another  meg
anyone living in either area probably wants both regions  available so you can see that the  meg cartridge is key
all in all a  very cool toyfirst i want to say i am very happy with the talking spiii
it is does a pretty good job routing and if you drive off the route it will autorecalc a new route for you
i have used numerous gpss in the past and this does a great job for driving for biking or hiking i highly recommend the garmin  map my favorite gpsnow there are some things to know about this product however
first you get a cd that allows you to download maps from your pc to your steetpilot
it works over either serial or usb usb goes to a mb memory card that you can plug in
the cd contains maps of the us but you only get to select one region of the us for free
the rest of them you must pay for from garmin for approx  a shot  total for the total us
you can purchase this online at garmins web site and they will give you a key to open up the different regions
the base map
the one built into the garmin on the gps is still quotgoodquot for the whole us but the cd give much better detail
i am not complaining about this since the maps seem pretty up to date
the road i live on is  years old and no other mapping software to my knowledge has it as part of their data but the garmin software didanother thing to note is the form factor for the streetpilot iii and the older street pilots are different
this can be important if you order from garmin direct accessories like the bean bag mount as i found outplease allow me to preface this review with the fact that i have absolutely no sense of direction
for those with excellent sense of direction this may seem like an extravagant purchase until they come down in costi had to travel to california recently i only lived there my whole life before  but since i had never driven in california before i was quite nervous about doing so
the rental car had a gps very similar to the street pilot and using that gave me a great sense of confidence in driving aroundshortly after my return i realized how badly we needed a gps in our car
the street pilot was the best option for us because it has all the features of a factoryinstalled auto gps but the added convenience of being portable now when i head out of town i can take the street pilot rather than having to rent a car with a gps
not to mention the street pilot is about  to  of the cost of a factoryinstalled systemsome of the other reviewers have complained about how long it takes the street pilot to recalculate a route once the vehicle has gone offroute
i have intentionally gone offroute several times just to see how it performs and i have been very pleased
it does take a few seconds but from my experience it did not take so long that i got any further offcourse than i already wasa feature that i found to be very helpful in the street pilot which was not in the rental cars gps is a search by company name
if youre looking for a department store but you cant remember its address just search by the name and the street pilot will navigate you to the closest one
if youre looking for that great chinese restaurant a couple of miles away but you cant remember the name you can search for chinese restaurants in your area and find the correct one based on its address
want to order ahead or put your name on the seating list
once the street pilot finds the restaurant youre looking for it displays their phone number on the monitor as wellabout the only two complaints i have about the street pilot are very trivial
on the rental car i used the gps would automatically lower the volume on the stereo when the gps needed to announce an instruction
being an external unit the street pilot does not have this luxury
since i tend to listen to music well at earsplitting volume while driving it does take a little getting used to lowering the volume when using the street pilot around town but again this is a very minor complaint given all of the positive features the street pilot hasmy other complaint is that occasionally it does give directions which are not the most direct route
i used this on a trial basis in areas i was familiar with just to see how it performs and i did find myself thinking on occasion why is it telling me to go this way when that way is much more direct
especially since i live within a half an hour of garmins world headquarters it would seem to me that they would at least know the most direct routes around here
but even at this the street pilot does get you to the correct destination every time even if it sometimes takes an indirect routei noticed that the package includes both a beanbag mount and a permanent dashboard mount for the street pilot
since street pilots have a way of being swiped my suggestion would be to always use the beanbag mount since a permanent mount could cause thieves to break into the car to find the gps that is no longer in the car
i drive a new jetta and i did not want to get sticky stuff all over my dashboard so i chose to try out the beanbag
it does not slip even when making sharp turns
i suppose if i were in a collision this would not be the case but in normal driving the beanbag is greatof course as others have advised do not leave your street pilot in the car unattended for any reason
but given the fact that youre going to be spending around g for this puppy you probably already knew thatand one other safety feature that i think is great but others might be annoyed by it once you are driving you cannot change the destination it goes into a secure mode
to change the address you need to stop the car
this may be a nuisance to some but given how badly people drive while talking on cell phones its probably best that garmin tries to curb people from pressing all sorts of buttons on their gps while zipping down the road at  mphhow much would you spend to protect your  palm
this case looks real good and it fits your palm like a glove adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it
leather may look more stylish but they are also bulky
a great buyi too thought this case was a bit on the flimsy side given its plastic  metal covering construction
however my palm vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb and its because of this case
it opens easily closes easily and still fits in my pocket comfortably
im confident the palms screen is protected with this case
its given great service for over a year nowthe hard case is stylish compact and a good protector of my investment
one reviewer wrote that it is difficult to charge the palm with the case on
it really isnt a problem at all if you place the charger on the edge  of your desk so that hard case can extend off
i dont worry about it  falling over since the charge is so sturdy
i love the case because it  provides such great protection in a stylish manner
enjoyvery nice
my palm vx fits in it  is protected
it is also shinythis case has worked great for me
it protects your palm v from falls spills and related quotaccidentsquot i also like the look of the case a lot
it blends well with the design of the palm v the only  quotconsquot i could find to this case is that it will add weight and  size to your palm
nonetheless it is well worth the protection you get  plus this will fix the problem the palm v has with its regular cover of  turning itself on
sure youll have to pull the palm v out of the case  to hotsync but that will only take  secs
i love my hard case and it has  certainly lived up to its job of protecting my palmi was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first
afterall it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it
i no longer have doubtsi have unintentionally dropped my palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces brick hard wood floor etc
 and both the case and more importantly the palm itself have come out completely unscathedso my advice is if you are looking for real protection for your investment just get one of these
there is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others unless you are planning on using the palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting rangenot surprisingly the engineers over at palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish too
you dont feel geeky pulling it out and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the palm itselfan excellent productthis is the best palm v case going actually almost the best
palm just released a metallic blue special edition hard case that i like a little better but this case is greatwhile the plastic was a bit of a  turnoff at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more  attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the palm v itself
i imagine  that is part of the reason you bought the v instead of the iii or the  viithe case does not close quite as tight as i would like but if you  mess with centering the hinge it closes
it provides the best protection of  the cases i have tried and does not make the palm so bulky that you cant  stand to take it everywhere you goi would recommend this or the new  blue case to anyone who likes the sleek modern look and wants to protect  their investment and their datathis is a great item
i tried three different soft cases and always had a problem with the palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket
give this baby five starsthe critism is wrong
a  cant use left  handed
sure you can
just put it in the left sideb
cant synch  while in the case
you bet you can
just tilt the stand to the side
no  problemi initially bought the special edition one but since i loved that so much i went out and bought the silver one as well
now i rotate my cases
the only difference of the silver case and the blue special edition case other than color is the logo in the front
the blue one has the circular palm logo while the silver one has the dotted p logo of palm like the one that you see whenever you reset the unit
i first bought the slim leather case for my vx and after i used it for about  months i became quite dissatified with it
one of the reasons why i was not happy with the slim case was because it made the whole vx a lot bigger then it really is
also after a few months the leather case had a few noticable scratches
it also began to warp
i decided to find an alternative
after much thought i decided to get the hard case for the vx
at first i was discouraged that i had to remove the case every time i hotsynced
however after heeding the suggestions of many others i found that proping it up on a book or a bunch of cd cases actually works well
i dont think there is any other case that allows you to sync that easy without removing the case
in that aspect i dont think there is a better case
however i discover that you have to insert the unit properly for the case to open and stay closed right
if you dont push the case far enough into the silo it really wont work right
if you insert the unit properly it opens and closes brilliantlythe spring loaded feature of the case is probably its best feature
when opening and closing the case it is very noticable that there is more tension opening the case then there is closing
in that aspect there is really no other case out there at offers thatone thing that i disliked about the slim leather case was that often times the buttons were accidentally pressed
whether it was the application buttons or the power button it often got pressed even with the leather case firmly closed
that was not the case for the hard case
although the contrast button was pressed occationally pressed its extremely rarealso with the hard case firmly shut the unit is allowed to move a little just enough to allow some impact to be absorbed when you accidentally bump or drop itfinally and more importantly the case is one of very few that actually protects the unit looks good and maintains the shape and sleekness of the vx
it adds virtually nothing to the overall size of the vx
its beautifuli just hope that it will fit the m when i go get thati tried the chintzy cover that came with the palm v but it does not offer enough protection
then i tried the quotslimquot leather case from com and its ok but bulky and the strap that closes it is inconvenient
finally managed to find the hard case at compusa and like it the best
ok its not perfect you do have to remove the v or put it on a book in  order to hotsync but so what
for my money the hard case is the way to  gothis one is a good extra investment if youre buying a palm v  the little leather flap that comes with the palm is really not adequate to protect your machine
this hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows
it looks elegant and its not too big  the palm will still fit in your  shirt pocket when in the case
i recommend getting this one  you need to  get something to protect from scratching anyway and this case protects  from much much morethese batteries are exactly what i expected  volts and work well for any electronic device i put these in i plan on buying even more in the future this is a great buyreally good deal for only  dollars
they came very quick and work like there supposed to
i got what i pad for and have no regretswhy case logic discontinued these ill never know
back in my dvd collecting days there were my chosen medium of storage and protectionif you have a lot of dvds or cds these wallets are the way to go
i have over  cds and they were eating up my space
after getting rid of all the jewel cases i can store all of my cds and dvds on one book shelf
and since i organized them by theme it is easy to find what i am looking for
by the way you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  whiteout pen
it makes it easy to know whats inside each wallet
for the dvd wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the liner notes
but it is easy to do
trust me once you start using these wallets youll love em
for what you get with these wallets i find the price fair
even better here on amazoncom enjoycaselogic has set the standard for media storage and this continues the tradition
a few tweaks are needed however
i am certain that i will soon fill the  slots
therefore it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk
the graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed
actually i would prefer that the dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way arounddefinitely worthwhile for equipment one wants to keep
i teach at an urban high school
it is amazing what some students will take
ever since a student took my projector when i had a sub so i could attend a meeting i lock as much down as possible
interesting that the school district does not bother with locksi chose this because i had a monitor without a lock slot
it was almost impossible to find a lock with its own plates
this comes with  plastic discs and a tube of supergluegood points thick cable discs stick wellbad points cable only works with discs not lock slots or holes it can pass through
i dont want to stick a disc to my computer so im using my old lock for ithopefully i never have to find out whether these are affective or not so i can only comment on the concept
you can either tie two things to a stable heavy object such as a big desk or you can tie three pieces of hardware together such as in the picture and make it a pain in the behind for someone to take all three at once and walk out your door
of course none of that matters if the person knows you have the cable and brings a snazzy pair of bolt cutters
i havent seen a product like this before so i was thrilled to install it it took  minutes its a better deterrent than the more popular kensington slot locks but will leave a gray lock on whatever you put it on so choose wisely
in the end as with most inexpensive security devices its really about the piece of mind rather than the effectiveness of the product
if you want more you can dish out some extra green and get you one of them mi laser systems
coolexcellent lock
kensington builds good stuffkensington desktop microsaver universal computer key lock and cable security system i ordered thru antonline though and i was delivered an open box which was missng some parts
i ended up going thru the complete dispute procedure to resolve the issue
antonline did not respond
amazon refunded my money  nice jobthis will help give you a sense of security
i know from personal experience that you will have to take a hammer and chisel to these discs if you want them off
wrap them around the desk and you are good
easy and quick to install smart design of the discs and the wire just dont lose the key excellent
just what i needed to secure a inch flatscreen tv
of course it hasnt been put to the acid test yet but install was easy enough and it seems solid enoughthe parts that glue to the hardware are quite small compared to other brands
it really just takes a few minutes to install and then your hardware is secure from the evildoers who want to steal your ramthis product came as described and worked perfectly
i consider all factors when ordering including quality price and company reputation
this product passed all
i can recommend this to otherswhile it is not by any means foolproof i do feel better
the install was a breezejust what i needed to protect my valuable stuff that i cant take with methe security cable kits i bought didnt have good glue pads on the anchors so i ordered more anchors and used the superglue instead with much better resultsanything can be defeated but this definitely improves security well designed and thought out
delivered on schedule with usual good servicei share a house and always wonder if something might happen
these add extra security
locks are meant to keep honest people honest
of course any really determined thief will get them off but at least these will slow them down and maybe make them look for any easier targethave a small home safe for documents and cash at home
wanted to create a deterrent to someone walking off with itthe outside of the small safe is plastic and the adhesive worked great on the case
i now secure it to a fixed object and have some level of security
not many solutions out there for securing file safes to fixed object that i could findgreat value does the jobgreat for securing computer equipment
currently i purchased this to use in a hospital and was exactly what i was looking forthis is surprisingly the best power strip i ever had
i love it for many reasons its compact form the color code system i can fit all the chargers in without conflicting with each otherthis multioutlet has a long cord  so we were able to make a charging area for  devices and their respective adapters of all shapes and sizes quite far from the outlet
the product also looks nice enough to have out in plain sightpros heavy enough to stay where you put it
 cord long enough to be useful
 more aesthetically pleasing than the long beige stripscons octopus style wiring does not support most cord organization strategies
 priceythis is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a  foot cord and i find that to be so useful
i have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs
i like this kensington model so much that i have just purchased another as a giftthis is a nice looking and space saving  socket outlet
i replaced an old powersquid with this unit and it has worked as expected
i really like the color coded sockets and the circular design which resulted in a smaller footprintthe amazon page gives dimensions of the package
here are some specifics regarding the product alone oz weight not incuding cord measured on my kitchen scales inches outside diameter of circular part inches or a little less height with nothing plugged into itthe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legspads upon which it rests
therefore it does not slip on my granite countertopproblem that this product solved my kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop
i wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side for cooking appliances in the kitchen or for plugging in my ipad or kindle while using them in the den
i cant imagine why an outlet wasnt thought of when my house was first built
i was going to call an electrician to add one but this power strip seems to work just as wellhow it solved my problem the power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when i am using the plugged in ipad
i could only make it slip off if i pulled it hard in a horizontal direction
the cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den
the price  seemed high a first but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot morei love the round design on this
the design allows for you to use big plug in adapters and not have it take up another outlet
i use this in my office and it works wellthis works perfectly for what i needed it forit fits adaptors well and the circular shape is definitely welcomed verses just a strip
this also has a long cord which is incredibly helpful
definitely a good buythis circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work where we hold many training sessions
we have used it for many months and not had any issues with it
its heavy enough that it stays in place and light enough that i can lean down yank it over plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath
it is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our and our trainees abuse without any problems
perfect for areas where a long power strip wont work or would be less convenientthis does exactly what i needed it provides a surge strip with plenty of room for transformer wall wartssome of the pluses the cord is nice and long and the plug is flat so it can go behind furniture the outlets are color coded and it includes a couple of sets of corresponding color cord stickers you can put on device cords so you know what device you are unplugging when the cords all look alike the device itself is actually smaller than it appears in the pictures
for me thats good because it takes up less space
the footprint is roughly the size of a salad plate like most other plug strips there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelfim very satisfied with my purchaseit is small enough to sit om my desk and large enough to hold all of my chargers  it eliminated the cord clutter on the desk and the colour code is fantastic and it is approved by ul and csa expensive but well worth it will recommed to my friendsi already own one of these surge protectors and like it very much
so when the need arose to purchase a second surge protector i went with another kensington   for me the major selling point is the sixteen foot cordi am very happy i purchased the same surge protector a second timetoday  i finally became temporarily not lazy opened the box
it already has three outlets being usedi ordered another one but returned it when i found a better product by kensington from another online store
of course the new model is much more expensivei grabbed this quick on cyber monday not noticing it was a table top unit
i have too many electronics by my bed and had one of those small white strip surge outlets
the problem was  of the  items i charge there have those transformer big plugs so i hade to plug and unplug all the time
with this one i can plug in my decorative lamp floor ott light alarm clock tablet nintendo ds and breathing machine
everything is now neat and i dont have to keep switching things out
at most only  items are in use at one time
i like the quick on and off button i can lean over and hit should i choose tothe unit is very well made and i expect many years of good service from itwith a new hp touchscreen computer i also needed a minimal footprint surge protector  this really answered my need on a modestly sized desk top
thank you kensingtonwe recently placed this smartsockets power strip under our conference room table
it looks good and has plenty of room for some of those larger adapters
we dont use or need the color coding but it does add to the visual appeal of the unit in a professional settingthe circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle
there is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base
the colors are not the same so different appliances can be assigned a different color
useful if you have to unplug on device to use in another room or locationi love this because of the sixteen foot cord
so versatile in where you can use it
highly recommend to anyonethis works well on a conference table like for class sessions with multiple laptops
will hold  of the larger powersupply type plugs if needed
these come in handy
functional as well as attractive with the different colors
the color scheme allows instant identification of cables with stickers that come with iti bought this for use on my desktop
the shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones hard drives etc
the power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use
nice long power cord heavy base keeps it from moving around to much
highly recommendedi am the very satisfied owner of the palm v connected organizer
i had long wanted a hand held organizer one that would have both computer interchangeable abilities and one that would be able to perform different applications
christmas day was a happy one for me last year not only because of the brimming smiles on my childrens faces but because that is when i received the palm v as a gift from my santa my wife
after giving the product and its instructions a look over within moments i was on my way and began the charging procedures necessary prior to its use
this was my only initial disappointment having to wait for the initial charging that takes  hrs
i couldnt wait to tinker with my new toy and it was a bit annoying
after completing the charge up i installed the cd that came with the product to familiarize myself with it
the cd is both quite informative and very easy to follow
then i was ready to begin to learn about my new toylooks can be deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the palm v in viewing the device with its ultra sleek thin design one might come to the conclusion it could be nothing more than your basic addressdate book
this little quotpower packerquot as i like to call it is simply amazingthe applications that can be utilized with the palm v as well as the storage capacities are as follows address book that holds up to  addresses appointment record that records up to  appointments email functioning that can receive up to  email messages memo pad that can hold up to  memos to do list that records up to  todo items expense reports games security calculatorall storage figures are approximate and flexible according to the overall storage capacity of  mbthe palm v also comes complete with the necessary software to facilitate all functions on the organizer
other items that came with my palm v were the synchronizing cradle amp battery recharger the handbook an adapter a protective cover and one metal stylus and a spare plastic onewhile the palm v comes to you with all the preprogramming stated in my epinion it also has the capability of being able to receive downloads from the internet to expand its functions or to simply download games to play on this hand held devicethe ease of operation of the palm v is remarkable
on its face are are  buttons on the metal frame and an area on screen with  buttons to be used with the stylus as well as an area for information input or free hand graffiti writing
all of these help the user quickly and efficiently operate the palm v to expedite the tasks at hand
the device also has a back light that can come in rather handyinput of information into the palm v can be done in a number of ways
one can access the keyboard on the device or use special graffiti free hand writing to input the desired material
the device may also be directly hooked up to your pc and the information typed in with your computers keyboardthe greatest thing about the palm v is the ability to transfer data between the device and your computer
the ability to be able to access email download information from the internet or your computer for me is a god send and in my opinion nothing sort of revolutionary
to process the transference of information the palm v needs to be placed into the hotsync cradle
then the user just presses the hotsync button on the device to perform the hotsync operation
it proves to be completely user friendly as far as the exchange between the organizer and the computermaintaining your organizer requires as little as a few minutes charging a day of the palm v by placing it in its cradle
no need to buy batteries it is self contained with a lithium ion rechargeable battery
it is so small in size and weighs a mere  ounces it easily is carried in a coat pocket both comfortably and unnoticedmy main use for the palm v is during my business hours
it is always on my person for me to access at a moments notice to jot down things i need to remember which are many with my bad recall
whether it be to record an appointment that i have just confirmed with a client or a note to myself the palm v has become an invaluable device one that has proven to make my day much more pleasant and hassle free
no more need to run to a desk for a paper or pen or to ask my callers to hold on i am always ready with my palm v on handif you do not have any prior experience with a hand held organizer of this kind and always thought about purchasing one i would highly recommend the palm v once you have had a device like this you will never want to be without one
just like all the modern luxuries in life what you dont have you do without and dont miss but what youve had and have no longer is greatly missed and still desired for easier living
thank you palm v for making my life just a little bit easierjanuary    coms palm pdas are definitely the best pdas on the market
you  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is
as a palm collector i have all palm  and pilot models i will rather compare the palm v to the  palm vx
the  only difference between the two is that  the v has mb of ram while  the vx has i have thousands of addresses thousands of appointments and  many  more todo items documents etc
in my palm
i  also have fax email  and internet software  installed among many other programs
i only use  about   mb
therefore although i have the vx i dont use any of the  additional memory
technically because of the additional  memory the  vx is faster
nonetheless because palm  applications are so small this  difference is truly  negligible
therefore before you spend  more on  the vx make sure youre going to use the additional memory
its the  only differencenow remember the v  series is rechargable while the iii series uses  aaa  batteries
therefore travelling with a v palm means youll have to  carry around the cradle
if youd rather use batteries maybe  the iiix is  better for yougood lucka quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device and some suggestions from a vetran palm upgrader ive returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times
there are a few  things i love about this device you dont end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models  it costs lesser than the  palm vx  synchronization with outlook  is flawless  the screen is  very readable in bright outdoors  the battery lasts and lasts they  arent energizer bunnies
things i do not like about this the  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy
 applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitiveoverall perceptions  good value for the money  buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work pcs accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle  do not attempt to browse the web on  thisyoull only be disappointedi had trouble the first week getting the palm to hotsync to my thinkpad and the palm  even crashed once losing all my data before the hotsync was workingsince then this thing has become an essential part of my life
works like a charm both the palm  itself and the hotsync too

reallyprior to my palm v i had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when i needed them most
as a result  i often forgot to do things that needed to be done lost important phone  numbers etcyou get the ideamy palm v changed everything
now i keep  everything important from the standard addresses to dos notes and  appointments to my accounting info stock portfolio and local movie times  thanks to avantgocom all on my palm v and its greata warning to  those buying palm vs though
it takes time to get used to it
i hated  grafiti the quothandwritingquot you must use for the palm to recognize  your input at first and found the miniscule onscreen keyboard a pain
additionally i saw no real point in keeping a to do list and all my  appointments on the thing
after a month of forcing myself to do so  however i was hooked
after really taking the time to get familiar with  the thing i use it on the order of twenty times a dayfar more than ive  used any other device digital or oldfashioned pen and paperso my  buying advice buy one
palm vs are absolutely fantastic really
theyre  beautifully designed you wont feel geeky pulling one out
and the  handiest things in the world
i promise
be sure to buy one of the hard  cases to keep it beautifulusing my palm v always makes me smile because it is about as close to perfect as any electronic device ive ever usedif anyone is on the borderline not sure if a pda is for them this device will not disappoint
it does everything that youd want it to do does it well and does it  quickly
plus the ability to sync the palm v with your computers pim  inc microsoft outlook makes importing and exporting contacts a  breezeif youre not sure about the graffiti writing system i can tell  you that its a very easy to learn
five minutes worth of practicing and  youll have it down its very very close to the normal alphabet
after  a few days youll have it completely memorized the palm folks also include  a handy quotcheat sheetquot sticker that you can stick to the inside of  the cover thats included with the palm vas someone who bought an  apple newton messagepad and lived though that debacle i can say from  experience that the palm is not a product that only a geek can love
anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and  appointments will find this device invaluable and i sincerely mean that
once you have one you will not want to be without it and it sure beats  hauling a fat old paper based organizer aroundsome quick notes the  palm v hard case rocks
if you travel a lot make sure to get one
it  keeps the palm v completely safe from harm and looks beautiful
also with  the upgrade to palm os  youll be able to sync your palm with any  laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables
this is  very very cool and very useful for road warriors one caveat here the ir  sync does not yet work on windows based systemshope this helpswell it has taken three weeks and three different online companies to get the palm v to me
was it worth the wait
you betalthough its a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and lcd screens
after filling up  my address book downloading email and news through avantgo as well as  various applications and games i still have about k left
mb may seem  like a small amount of storage to some people but it goes a long way as  long as you manage your email games and amount of avantgo channels you  read
the hotsync operation only takes a few minutes and i spent a total  of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti  language
once fully charged the battery never seems to diminish no  matter how much i use it
even though the palm v did not come with a nice  checkbook program i found a free one immediately at downloadcom
now  that the us version is sold out in most places i would highly recommend  considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the  same as the us version with an international ac adapteri was skeptical about using the palm but once i started it quickly became indispensible
i have eight large rolodex files on it plus tons of memos and to do items
the mbyte of memory is still handling it with no  problem
give it five starsi have found a few places that will do memory upgrades for all the palms
m seems to be the maxi bought one of these for my husband as an early fathers day present and he loves it
he says quotbecause its small and convenient its always there so you can make quick notes as needed
its perfect for keeping track  of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and  remembering thingsanother nice feature is that using the hotsynch  connection the pp easily transfers information back and forth from  computer to the pp itself
this is especially effective when one uses  outlook and the pp will even allow you to write and store email which will  automatically be sent later if you choosequothe loves this thing  uses it all the time and it certainly makes him more organized
his last  word on it isquoti should have bought one a year agoquotgo for  it folks you wont be disappointedmy palm v was wonderful and i replaced it immediately when it was stolenprobably the best argument that i really got good value from it
i had not used any form of portable computer pda or similar device before  but after just a few months i found mine indispensible
i chose the palm v  over the other palms and over any windowsbased system because of the  sliim profile
i can put it in the front pocket of my slacks and it is not  obtrusive
the usefulness of the builtin functions for keeping todo  lists addresses and calendars is obvious
less obvious is using all the  downloadable software available on the internetoften for free but more  often at a modest price at least for the really useful stuff
i use the  calendar book function in a way i suspect the designers didnt intendi  enter reminders to myself for a set date and time so my alarm will go off  and the palm will display a message such as quotcall norman nowquot  i  also find the search function very useful
if i remember that i dealt with  norman but have forgotten his phone number or last name i can have the  palm search for quotnormanquot and display his name and address  assuming i entered it when i first talked to him as well as any notes or  memos i wrote about our discussion
you can do this for any word or name  so if i remember discussing widgets with a guy but have forgotten his name  or phone or company i can search for quotwidgetsquot and again  everything ive entered on the subject will be available
in fairness i  have to say that if you dont have a fairly busy life you may not have  much use for it but if your life is a busy one i predict you will find  the palm v or palm vx invaluable
this includes people who arent  quothighpowered executivesquot  stressedout students or overwhelmed  homemakers will find it usefulive gone from the palmpilot pro two years ago to the palm iii and now have the palm v so i definitely appreciate how small and thin the v is and how much clearer the screen is than on the previous models
a few months ago my  palm v fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down shattering the  screen
i called com and they charged me  dollars to replace it and  sent a refurbished one that came in two days
i was satisfied with the  process and its good to know that they understand how important it is to  be back in action fast as possiblethe leather flip cover that comes  with the v works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket and  eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet  which adds to the over aesthetics of this product
a less obscure point is  that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm v around  just as much as you carry a walleti can use the infrared port on the  palm v to connect to my gsm phone ericsson i on omnipoint and get  regular internet access
requires proxinet irdalink software and a  standard isp
its not the most functional thing in the world but it  actually works
there is so much good shareware out there for the palm  tetris document readers and books finance calcs customizing hacks  etc
 and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and  install new programs with relative easei needed one centralized location for all my information especially appointments and phone numbers
the palm v has given me exactly that
ive installed a couple of shareware applications but have not found that  i use them so the  mb memory is going to be fine for me
the interface  is elegant and simple and its easy to input data with the stylus
after  using the included cover and then trying the leather case i finally ended  up with the hard case and i like it the best
all the palm users who talk  about how it has changed their lives are not just blowing smoke this  device has succeeded where countless paper organizers and calendars have  failed
and its fun and looks coolthe palm v is one of those electronic gizmos you dont think youll ever need and then when you get one you cant live without it
ive been carrying mine around like a pacifier
when someone stops me on the street  and wants to set up and appointment i used to take their number and check  my calendar back at the office
now i can take their number and make the  appointmentcom has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come  up with a real winneri received my palm vx in  it is now march of  and i am still actively using it
i am so very grateful
there have been some scary times when i thought the end had arrived but i was wrong
the problem ended up being so crazy
a button was stuck
consequently the unit would run out of juice and not charge
once i figured that out i have been able to revive it without much incident
i have read many of the reviews about the tungsten e and am quite discouraged about buying it
thus i will continue to offer life support as long as this palm vx allows
it has served me so very welli spent about  months trying to decide whether an organizer could be worth this much money
i just bought my palm v last week and its hard to imagine life without it now
the palm v is simply the best purchase ive made in a long time
its an incredibly small and sleek little machine
it  fits right in your shirt pocket even with the hard case i bought for it
it has all the standard things youd expect from an organizer address  book to do list agenda expense report
the graffiti system writing  instead of typing only takes a little while to get used to
the palm  desktop software and cradle allows you to back everything up in a few  seconds
no batteries are necessary because you can recharge the palm vin  the cradle
hundreds of extra programs and games can be downloaded
if  youre trying to decide which palm to buy i definitely recommend the v  the vx is about the same but it has more memory which i dont think ill  need and costs a lot more the iii series is great but not as sleek and  the vii has the builtin modem which doesnt interest me much
go for the  palm v  if youre trying to decide whether its worth the money the  answer is a resounding yesi love my palm v
i won it over the internet and now i dont leave home without it
very simple to use and extremely useful
i store telephone numbers my date book grocery lists myriads of other lists for work and home and just yesterday i downloaded a trial copy of splashphoto that lets me show a slide show of family pictures on my palm v  a great electronic toygreat and slightly more sturdy version of the popular palm
i like the metal casing
i hate the fact that when you put the unit in your shirt pocked it is very easy to create pressure on the buttons and pretty soon the device is scrolling and clicking awayperfecti love these inserts
i used to print on cardstock and cut out my own labels
my lines never turned out straight and i always ended up with inserts that were too large or too small
with these i end up with a great looking label label that fits perfectlyfast delivery and great productproduct does exactly what i need and the price works very well for me
will keep on buying these for as long as i need toim slowly getting my program cds into jewel cases and needed a way to label them
im going far too slowly to try doing the labels on a computer and am handlettering them
they fit well and do what i need to doi read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software
i found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning softwarefellowsneato i had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the dvd coversinserts correctly
i spent maybe  minutes and then began printingi use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual coversinserts
some have said they would like a glossy paper option and i agree
this paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but i still find it to be ok if i has the option for glossy paper i would purchase that instead
i back up mostly movie dvds and would like a more brilliant quality output
if i were backing up data dvds i would not have an issue with the paper quality
i have not used any other brands so i cannot at this time give a contrasting opinion of other products
i plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie dvd coverinsert needs
i will update later as i get more data on this subject
for now ill say these covers are a good value for the moneythese labels are perfect for what they are supposed to do and are pre fit exactly to the space provided and are exactly what i was shopping fori have tried an awful lot of cd inserts and these are by far the most cost effective and functional
i just love themthese are fine
they are not glossy but they are measured right and very good for home made covers of dvds and cds  there were some whiny reviews but remember they are not pro photo paper
they work just fine though and look goodi will definitely be back to get more of these i like these because they are easy to work withi have a recording studio so i make a lot of cds
most of my artists gives me the information they want on the cd  jewel case insert  i do the rest
i hope memorex never stops making these inserts  amazon never stop carrying them
i go through several thousand a yearpurchased as a gift for daughter
she was very satisfied with quality and the colors to help her arrange her music by catagorygood price and great sellerprompt shipthese jewel case inserts worked very well but what makes this a star is the software from memorex that makes it easy to set the titles and import pictures
they also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts
this is the same software for the cd labels so it makes it easy to learn
i was able to supply our kids with dvds of them as children each with their individualized jewel case and dvd label
made a great christmas presentthe title of my review says it all
i am running a very old jewel case designsoftware program
nevertheless this product works perfectly and producesvery professional looking resultsthese worked very well first time and every time so far on my printer
id been printing my inserts on pound paper before so these are a vast improvement the perforations make it easy to separate the partsi love the grade of the paper and ease of perforated edges makes it easy to insert and look pro you can find the templates online at the memorex referred websitei only wish they had a more professional grade photo paper it would definitely be worth whatever extra cost even a  pack of paper
possibly a better economy template as well so i dont waste so much of the  xas a network administrator in an enterprise enviornment i agree that generally you wouldnt use this card in a corporate enviornment
but large companies buy products in bulk and they get the deals that the everyday user doesnt get
but in all honesty you could probaly run this card with no problems on an enterprise level network  the performance is great especially for but for general networking in a medium sizedsoho enviornment you cant beat it
this card seems to work with every system i have installed it on  no matter the platform or osits cheap well documented and easy to install
is there anything else really to sayothers have written about poor manuals and shoddy components
this might be true
im not a beginner with network software or hardware but im hardly a pro either
i had zero problems installing this manual seemed  fine to me and havent had any problems using it since
btw i use it to  hook into my dsl connection
if it didnt work id just send it back  amazons always been great about this
and the price is just too hard to  pass upi have  of these nics running here at home and i also have a  port hub from netgear
it was so simple to install
i tried another brand  nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them
i took them  back and got netgear fatx
plugged them in and it worked the first  time
i dont know about you but i hate quothard to install  hardwarequot a great buy at amazon 
i need one more so i am buying  it here
thanks amazonim moderately comfortable with my pcs innards but im no hardware guru
therefore i was extremely pleased when this card installed with the ease the documentation and other amazon reviewers promised
the low price was icing on the cakesimply put the netgear fatx works
it is an extremely simple card but not much is required in a ethernet card
those of you needing wol support why
should not purchase this card as it does not support it
the speed and throughput is consistant with more expensive cards my lan does not require speeds up to mbps anyway but it is good to know it is there
the cards are good priced so it will not cost much to outfit a small network with these cards i have one in every desktop in our lan
they work what more could you askcant be any finer with how compatible it is and how bullet proof they made these
im glad that these were available still they are prefect for mbps network access
i wish they would get into fiber at a systematic speed sheeti use this card for my home network and it has never given me trouble
i reccomend it for people wanting to quickly get a home network up and running
provided you pay attention to the network configuration requirements for your particular os this card is most unlikely to give you trouble
if you think you have a card problem carefully recheck your config work a few times first before blaming the cardthis card works great in red hat linux and windows
it is the only netgear card certified for red hat linux  as a matter of fact im ordering a th fatx card to replace a linksys card right now
im involved in linux and am presently converting an emachines box to a  red hat linux  machine
i ran into trouble with the linksys fastethernet  version  card in this box
it turns out red hat  can see that card but not the linksys chip so i need to replace it
end of my use of linksys cards but they work just great in windows networks and i have a complete linksysbased network running for a client as well
ill probably stick to netgear in the futurework well in linux  me nt and wink
i use these cards and the linksys pci cards all over my network both work greatthis nic is very robust as it is easily installed in any windows computer or even a linux box
netgears website is done very well in which you can get tech support issues resolved quite easilyi never had to contact tech support due to any of their items that i have purchased
their web site support is superbi highly recommend any of netgears productsi have bought over  of these for home and office use
they work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality
i was running windows  or windows  on all the computers
setup was a snap
just pop in the card to an empty slot
then install the drivers from the floppy disk that comes in the package
worked flawlessly everytime
i had no problems hooking up the ethernet card to a linksys dslcable router netgear ethernet hubs or a college dorm ethernet connectionget this card and you will get the convenience of file and print sharing when used in conjunction with some sort of hub and windows network neighborhood
anyone with little to no computer expertise can do this just by following the instructions
it may be a little difficult if you are scared of computers but it can still be done
just follow the pictures that come on the step by step setup foldoutthis is a network hub not to be confused with a network switch
a switch and a hub basically do the same thing except a hub sends all traffic through every port whereas a switch is more intelligent and only sends traffic to the port that is required to reach the intended destination
therefore a switch almost always provides better performance
a switch is probably what you actually wantthis hub does exactly what it is supposed to
every connected device can see the network packets sent by every other connected device which allows you to analyze the packets if you so choosethis is a great hub
work well
this is part of my first network that i installed myself
i used all netgear compnents and i am pleased with the simplicity of the installation
just plug and go
i do recommend the  netgear fatx nics alsoi got this hub in the mail plugged in the power plugged it in to my dsl modem plugged by pc and laptop into it and everything just worked
no configuration or anything despite my dsl setup basically no problems of any kind
cant beat thatthese days there is almost never a reason to buy a hub  for most applications everyone should be buying a switchi just bought for of these for our lab because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network softwarefor someone wanting a real hub the ds is a real hubi needed another ethernet hub for a software development project im working on
hubs are difficult to find these days as low cost network switches are a dime a dozen and provide isolation between network portsbut for network hardware development you do not want this isolation when you are trying to monitor network traffic between devices
that is where an ethernet hub comes in
yes you can use managed network switches but those are more expensive than the garden variety network switchthis hub was available at a fair price and works fine
if i need another one i would purchase againi bought this hub to connect the computers in my home so they could share a cable modem
i looked at a lot of baset hubs and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings
i am especially impressed with the hubs small size and metal case  other hubs are larger and have plastic casesto me the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it it just works
this hub gives me that in spadesmy cable modem makes for great fast internet access for one computer
but what about downloading updates for my ibook without disconnecting my imac
this hub has done that with ease
easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes
never a problem sincefor just a simple  mbps hub this is an excellent one for the price
it is compact and sturdy especially with the metal casing
link and status lights are handy along with the normaluplink switch
no software installation needed  plug the power in and the cat cables and youre all seti have the kodak dc  camera  and this carry case is perfect for it
this case is compact  but yet large enough to take everything along that i need  extra batteries pc cables the cameras manual and cd disk and a kodak aa battery chargerit works so well with the dc  its almost as if it was made for it
good case for the moneyto see if this case is right for you compare your digital cameras dimensions to kodaks dc   if the cameras are similar in size youre all setthis is the best camera bag i have purchased especially since it has the quality of any other case logic product superbi own an old toshiba pdrm digital camera and in this neat little bag there is a protected pouch for the camera two storage areas for digital media and a storage for aa or aaa batteriesi think this bag is super convenient since i can carry my extra smartmedia cards and spare aa batteries
the size of the bag is small enough to fit in my travel bag but yet has a lot of storage space for all the necessities of a digital camerai highly recommend for a small digital camera like my toshiba pdrm
dimensions of my camera quot long by quot high by quot deep
this camera is a perfect fit for this particular bagalright its just a bag but its a great bag for the olympus   it has room for everything i need for the camera
the camera itself battery charger an extra set of batteries a couple of extra media cards the accessory cords for downloading
all this fits into the bag very securely without everything banging into each other because of the pocket dividersthe bag is not too bulky rather compact with padding
the zippers function very well
the pockets designed such that i dont have to worry about things falling out
overall a very good bag to take along with the camera and recharging suppliesand its rain resistant got stuck in the rain at practice a few times padded for drop protection and fits a boatload of stuff
got my gamboy on one side and my digicam on the other
aa batteries in the secret compartment and money and stuff on the outsidei own the kodak dc digital camera and cant say enough about this case
it has room for my battery charger extra set of batteries all pc cables kodaks software cd and the manual that came with my cameraif your digital camera is similar in size to kodaks dc get this bag
its simply the best balance between compact size  and having enough room for all your accessoriesi ordered two and they came in the standard distribution box that stood up to thefreight carrierinside the carton was the two seperate retail sales boxes in premium shapeunits worked right out of the box once batteries were connectedpowerchute cd was original older version and the web had the updated  stable angled plug with a very sturdy cordthis sound card doesnt reproduce mp or wav files any differently than a more expensive card would
creative labs has always made great cards and drivers
the only thing this card doesnt give you that the more expensive card do is the d sound effects when playing video games and true dolby  for dvd playback
however i doubt many people are setup for this situation and many people do not watch dvds or play games
if this is you this card is perfect for you
if you are a gamer then this card will work perfectly fine
i personally find the d effects annoying and prefer to play on a card like this
i highly recomend this cardi keep a lot of computer equipment at home due to the fact that i am an a technician working to complete my mcse microsoft certified systems engineer credentials
i bought a preowned computer from ebay last month in order to practice setting up computer networks at home
this particular computer is a businessclass desktop designed more for the office environment rather than the typical entertainment pc that we would normally have at home
i decided to add dvd capability to this system in order to enjoy a movie at my work desk whenever the mood strikes me to take a break from work which happens quite frequently
i added a sony dvd player this particular soundblaster soundcard and a pair of cambridge soundworks speakers
within thirty minutes i was watching the lord of ringsnow about the soundblaster
this is a very good soundcard for its intended purpose
which is to provide basic sound functionality to a desktop computer
the sound quality is good enough to enjoy listening to stereo sounds from music cds and dvds
but please do not expect this card to provide you with theatrelike surround sound quality
this is definitely the wrong price range if you need that kind of qualityi compared the sound quality of this office system to my primary home system
my home system is a dell dimension  with a turtle beach soundcard and the altec lansing surround system
i switched the mode of operation of the altec lansings from surround to stereo for comparison purposes between the two systems
subjectively you can definitely tell the difference between the twoi can recommend this soundblaster to anyone who is simply looking to add stereo sound to his or her desktop computer
it is inexpensive and easy to install
it will require the use of one of your pci slots
for your information i installed this card on an ibm pl desktop pc
the system has a pentium iii processor and  mb of ram
it is running an evaluation copy of windows  advanced server
the dvd player is a sony ddu and the monitor is a kds  inch flat screen crt
if you are interested i wrote reviews on the kds monitor and the sony dvd player here at amazoni have owned other sound blaster sound cards
i have found creative labs to be the best in the sound card industry
this sound card is to replace and older modelso for the sound blaster card is functioning well
i always consider creative labs sound cards for all of my sound needsthis is a good binoculars
it is clear and light
buy it only if you really need x magnification
at times you will wish you didnt have so much of magnification
my next binoculars will be one with zoom the carrying case is cheaplooking so is the neck strapbought this in  and it going great
x is on the higher end and i would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot otherwise eit is goodbinoculars are very powerfulthe focus is simple and accurate
very pleased with the binocs and the price was terrificthe actual dimnetions of this product are  long and  wide  at the end of the product the part that we hold to our eyes is not quite as wide and fit to the eyesthese are very strong binoculars they are x the magnification the   the other  is simply the size of the front lens its  mm in diameter  wide they are very strong and you can see things very far away
if you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something then i believe these would be way to powerful and large
 also i read somewhere and i think its true that anything over x the magnification  these are x that you should use a tripod since its too hard to see properly since it needs to be completely stillgood product for the price i buyed for a gift  the owner says to love iti purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in india and am amazed by the quality of this product
certainly recommended and a great value for price
aaaaaaa plus qualityi purchased this modem for my folks pc and it works great
theyre running winse on an mhtz athlon with  mb ram
this brings me to a point i think is important
some reviewers running wink or winxp left negative reviews for this item because it didnt work with their computers
my advice is to know your computer before you buy any hardware for it
you should know what operating system youre running and its version and your hardware configuration at least your cpu speed ram and hard drive space
if youre using windows rightclicking on my computer and selecting properties will give you most of the info you need
so will system information in the system tools folder
its a simple rule and will save you a great deal of time and trouble in the long runthe modem installed and was configured in about  minutes from start to finish
tigerdirect is a good supplierthe best modem ive seen so far
way better the usroboticscom modems
i have two and they work very nicely
its the next modem ide buy if i needed another onei picked up my modem and installed it in just a couple of minutes
it was easy
when i log on it seems to connect at  every time
i guess that is good because my  connected at  i was going to buy that  one with the 
rebate but from the reviews  you get what you pay for
i  went with diamond and i am glad i did
the box says the requirements are  for a pentium  or higher
i have a pentium  and it has worked greatthe rio rocks
it is so great that diamond multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us the public to have the rio
this little baby holds your mps and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts
you simply cannot make  the music quotskipquot
take it jogging bob sledding whatever
the  rio is cute and compact battery lasts forever runs great and is really  simple to use
works well with the pc linkup etc
a hot itemfor the price this is really cool  you will need to buy extra memory but it works with free mp players to load
the headphones are ear type so get a real pair otherwise this worked greatput all those stupid fluffy descriptions aside because only  words are needed to describe these speakers  they rock
never thought i would pay so little for so muchthese speakers are extremely good
the sound is very clear the bass sounds very natural
get them
i found them incredibly difficult to find i searched over  sites until i finally got them
amazon totally has a monopoly going on
but anyway bottom line get these as soon as possible because i remember when they were available for like  and when i finally found them at like the rd site they were 
but they were worth it
maybe watch it if they reach like 
but otherwise yesthese are not big speakers but they have big sound
if you decide to get a pair you have to listen to the song quoti love big speakersquot
this has some good bass that will show you what the speakers can do
awesome speakersbecause these speakers still hold up here in  against some of the newest and most expensive computer setups
i remember when these first came out and were the first set of computer speakers to ever get a kickass review from the computer enthusiast magazine boot but i didnt buy these myself until  when they were on clearance for super cheapkinda wish i had bought more of them when they were so cheap since theyre still pretty much the best  computer speaker setup you can possibly have
the midrange these put out is unbelievable for a speaker this sizethey look a little outdated i have the black color so slightly less so but damn do these sound goodand ive owned and heard pretty much every thx certified   and  computer speaker ever madei purchased these headphones to go wmy electric piano and i am delighted wthem and so is my family
now i can practice as often as i want and not bother anyone  great sound and light on the head so no headaches and great price very affordableterrific for making adjustment in each individual eq for vocals and instruments
can help each voice and instrument sound better
plus it gives the vocals a better monitor mixwell built good sound worth the price can be used for short and long range applications multiple plugs makes it versatilethese are light and inexpensive
needed ones with this type of plug
use it with a portable keyboard
has a nice long cord
didnt need a fancy stereo headset
the sound is good and they clamp well over my ears
most of the fancier headphones start to fall off my ears even when tightening the head band to the max
like the feather weightthe acs speaker system came with the pc i bought way back in   the pc was an offbrand at the time known as abs
after researching my options for best pc under  i opted for the abs mainly because the review raved about the incredible clear and accurate sound from the included speakers
i still have that pc as a back up but i continue to use the altec lansings like a small bookshelf stereo system
i hooked them up by simply plugging them into the headphone jack on my mp player and the sound is just incredible
it puts out  watts total as much as some bookshelf stereo systems costing hundreds more
the bass is incrediblei have it sitting on an area rug so i dont get evicted
the highs are so accurate and can be tweaked using the eq on the mp player
midrange is a bit lacking but this also can be compensated for a bit with your eq settings
if you can find these used get emi have to ring in on this item
i have owned mine for over  years now and i sit at my home office desk many hours a day talking into itthere are many more elaborate and much more expensive items out there but my question is why
why would you spend  or  or even  dollars on something when this  dollar headset works as well as it does
i have never had anyone complain that my voice was weak or that i sounded odd when using this unit
in fact i dont think anyone can ever tell im on a headset
i can hear the caller crystal clear and the noise cancelling mic delivers as it was meant toin my opinion manufacturers do not always put as much effort in the headset jack section of phones they do not expect to be used in an office setting
this is not to say all office or multiunit phones are exceptional
some of these are weak in this respect
with simple home phones doubly somy motorola soho set has an excellent jack section
i mention this because this will have a huge impact on your experience with this or any headsetone huge problem for me with wired headsets has always been when walking around with the unit on i get the cord caught on doorknobs and various hazzards around the homeoffice
when this happens it rips the phone off of your ear and has destroyed more than one more expensive unit
hence the willingness to try this less expensive unit
funny thing is although ive managed to rip this thing off several times i dont seem to have damaged it in any way
it has outlasted every single headset i have ever owned
and it works and sounds as great now as it did the day i got iti bought this thing figuring if it worked but only lasted  or  months i could just buy another one and save some money going this route
well if it ever does break i can assure you i will be buying another oneone side note this makes a great gift for someone who wants a headset but doesnt want to spend the money for one
theyll never know you spent  dollars on it
not that i would do anything like that if you cannot handle an over the ear headset or if you are wireless this is obviously not a fit for you
if you are using a wired headset you should give this a trythis excellent headset in an outstanding bargin
sound quality is excellent with several cell phones i have tried and it is good with most cordless house phones cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the  micin fact sound quality is vastly better with other types of  earpieces and ear buds
in a normal room no one will know you are using  it
in a car it is slightly noticablesome friends complain that the  earpiece flops around a bit but indeed it never falls off
unless you  have really small earsthis headset works very well for me
i was skeptical at first about the plastic thing over my ear but its so light that i scacely notice
i also worried becuase the mike wound up next to my cheek not my mouth but it seems to have no adverse effect on the sound
people im talking to cant tell im using it and to me the sound is great
at the price whats not to like
i got one for each phone in our housei modded this to attach to my adxs
perfect gaming headset now
i hear and speak with clarity now
antlion modmic broke and didnt feel like spending  plus on the  bought the mic and  some mounting tape
would recommend over and overi bought this mic to put it on my audiotechnica headphone ads i knew cutting the plastic headband off if the microphone was garbage id just have to eat the cost
luckily as others have suggested on forums and even in reviews here the mic works great had to use some industrial strength sticky tape to keep them on the metal of my headphones but for the price this microphone is unbeatable in sound qualityive been using this mic for a couple of years now with a nice pair of headphones
velcroed them on and theyre good to goas i write this i am sad to say that my trackball is finally starting to show its age as it is becoming difficult to register clicks after  years of solid daily usethe design put years back on the life of my wrist and saved me from certain carpal tunnel issuesit is not easy for everyone to get used to it as i have laughed at many who have tried to use my pc for something quick but just like anything else it has a learning curve and i simply cannot imagine life without iti came to amazon hoping i could somehow score one of these without destroying my bank account and i fell on the floor when i saw what people are chargingthe sad part is that i actually considered spending  on getting one of these for a few momentsif i knew  that any of these ridiculously priced trackball fxs on here were brand new i would actually buy onethat is how good this thing isthis is a great large trackball that was discontinued after a few years by logitechit is however very much a vintage collectible  still functional as a trackball  but not current cuttingedge technologythe reviews start in  people
  theres no way logitech will provide a windows  driver for thisstill many users believe this is one of the best trackballs ever made comparable perhaps to themicrosoft trackball explorer also no longer made
a new mste one will set you back hundreds theyre scarce
amazon says they first stocked this in 
what is that  years before amazon launched
wasnt the web called arpanet thenthis mouse has served me well for the past  years and i hope it lasts another 
its ergonomic it doesnt need to be cleaned very often its very precise far more precise than the thumbballs logitech currently sells it has four buttons assignable to just about any function superior in every wayrecently i tried to buy another one for work but couldnt find anything like it
if you can find one buy it
and make sure to register it so logitech realizes its still populari have two of these one i just bought usedmint condition and one i bought new several years ago which is now dead
people who do computeraided design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the fx because the large ball gives you just that  better fine control than any other mouse or trackball
however some actions like drag and drop are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball and instead require the use of the rd button as a drag lock which is easy to do but different than you may be used to  once you get the hang of it it becomes second nature
the fourth button can be programmed for scrolling
the buttons are programmable  you can choose what function you want them to performthe hand placement over the curvaceous fx body is also very comfortable and even relaxing  once you get used to it and dont try to drag and drop with the left button and ball
you can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or strainingthe downside of this model is that logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit and no parts are available for repairs and no one i know repairs them
to get a part you must cannibalize another trackman marble fx and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span  assuming you can get a used one with still usable components
there are no new fxs anywhereanother downside is that the fx only came with either a serial port or a ps connector
there are no usb or wireless versions
and every attempt to utilize a usb adapter results in some functionality being lost
the serial port has long gone the way of the dodo bird and ps ports are nonexistent on new model computers
in another  years the fx will be largely obsolete and incompatible
this has already affected the going price
whereas a couple of years ago even a poorcondition fx commanded a steep price a mintcondition fx now command less than  i won my minty for only  just yesterday as i write this
yes there are vendors still listing fxs near  but they arent getting many takers if anythe bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics like myself who have yet to upgrade to a new usbonly pc or mac the fx is dated and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming outim writing this review in  many many years after this device has disappeared from the companys product lineup
i can state that this is the best input device ive ever used
ive owned several and had them on my work and home computers for very detailed cad d modeling and precision photoshop work
the downside with this and any trackball or mouse is that dust accumulates inside the housing but this is super easy to clean when it does
i occasionally think about replacements even though it looks funny even outdated no one makes a fingertip controlled trackball with ergonomics quite like this so i stick with it
logitech if youre out there please bring us a modern versiononce upon a time i got sick of the gunk build up on all the mice and trackballs i had used it got to the point where they would bump and jump on the mouse pads
i was intrigued when i saw the technology used in the  trackman line detecting position using the tiny dots on the ball
now  having used the fx trackman at home and at work for over  years i find  that it is the still the best input device of its kind including the new  msft optical mice
once one gets used to the button placement and develops  the dexterity to utilise the trackball constantly smooth and consistent  movement will reward them
with no moving parts for the tracking assembly  the user only rarely once a year
has to pop the ball out and clean the  sensors
this trackball does very well in digital art work with photoshop  and is especially excellent when used to play classic trackball arcade  games through mame emulation missile command tempest centipede  arkanoid etc
the tertiary buttons are recognized and used as scroll wheel  counterparts in wink its a nice fluff feature
my only wish would be  that logitech eventually upgrade them to use usb so i can plug them into my  msft keyboards
otherwise highly recommendedi originally paid  for this trackball at staples back in  im impressed at how the value of this mouse used has gone into the hundreds
yet im not surprised
this is an amazing trackball because it involves the movement of any  of the  leftmost fingers of the right hand
this means your hand wont get into repetitive motions that may cause permanent damage later on
i have been using this mouse for years and its still going strong
you just have to clean the ball and lenses once in a while
my mouse is ps but i am ordering a converter ps to usb
many attempts to convert me to other models have failed
my hand is completely comfortable and the buttons fall naturally where the fingers rest
truly perfect design
i just cant believe it has gone up in price over the years yet i can understand why
a true investment in the health of your hand fingers and wrist
totally worth the moneyits been about  years since i got my first trackman marble fx
at this time i still have  having tried just about every type and variation of input device on the planet i never found any other mouse device the equal of the tmftof course being a  year old design never updated it lacks the buttons and scrolling abilities of modern mice
which is too bad because if logitech revived this trackball and updated it with  more buttons and new software it would outsell everything else on the market by a wide margini have had three of these now in around  years
yes i said  years or at least since they first came out
they are the best trackball that was ever madeever made
they fit your hand like no other trackball out there including any that logitech has made since
i really hope that logitech will make them again because you cant beat them
they are so expensive now that most of the time you cant find one that you can afford
the few that are out there that are new are being sold for close to 
that is just unheard of
of course those doing that probably wont sell it or maybe they might
used ones are usually really used and the buttons will go out sooner or later
but if you can find one that has the logitech logo intact on the top and hasnt been rubbed off then it wasnt used much because that is the first thing to go and it doesnt take long for that to go maybe about a year or less of use
the one i have just purchased the logo is sharp and so i know that it hasnt been used much
even this one wasnt cheap but it was cheap enough that i was willing to foot the bill for it because you cant beat this trackballive been using this trackball at work for six years and i love it
i work in a d cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day every day
this track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use i find standard mice to be fatiguingafter more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me
the switch still functions but the button has broken and does not move anymore
i am very disapointed to find that logitech no longer makes this trackball i will be replacing it with a used one from ebaythese work perfectly with my motorola mr radios also purchased fromamazon
i got them headsets only as an afterthought
the sensitivity settings on theradios for headsetuse for vor use are a little touchy
i prefer using theptt button with headsets connected no breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter
still a good headsetthese work very well with my walkie talkies and give you some privacy when talking through the walkie talkies
i highly recommend thempurchase for the motorola msr mile talkabout waterproof way radios
the vox feature automatically sets up when this is plugged inokay it doesnt use batteries it doesnt light up and it doesnt cost a lot
but this headsetboom mic is an essential accessory for the talkabouts for this simple reason talkabouts have voiceoperated control vox when  used with a plugin headsetmic
we have also evaluated the earbudmic combo  for bike riders and found it almost unworkable it picks up road noise and  to me the earbud causes excruciating pain after a day of use
the headset  is a much better solution
the band actually fits over a safety helmet and  the closedfoamcell rubber pad grips the plastic shell securely
the boom  mic rejects most road noise and soon becomes forgotten in the course of  routine use
it quickly comes back to the foreground when i try to sip  from my water bottle
if you purchase one of the talkabouts consider this  as your second accessory purchase  your first should be a carrying  holster or case
now if motorola would only agree on a partnership with  jabra technologies to produce a jabra earset for the talkabouts my  happiness would be complete good product at a good pricethe earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use as one finds with an ear bud or the over the ear headsetbe careful to match the headset to the actual radio purshaced
this headset does not work with all radiosthis is a nice addition to my walkie talkies
make sure you have the right model walkie talkies for this micthere are quite afew out there that are more bulky looking
this particular one is more compact
its features include an earbud with a mic and ptt pushtotalk
the cord is a bit short however with my height  it stands to be just right
i was told that an extension can be pick up at a local radio shacki purchased these to use with the motorola talkabout and the cases while biking to work
i sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch
this was a good purchasethis push to talk ear bud worked great needed it for work and it never failed me
would purchase againwe all use these with our motorola radios while hunting
the animals are not spooked due to the earpiece
the earpiece fits comfortably in my ear without the foam
just press the button clipped to your collar and others can hear you even with a quiet whisperi bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear
so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio
this is a  pin remote speaker
your radio needs to have a slot for  pin to use thisprobuilt nicelyable to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything keep in mind of the noise around youpush to talk built inconi use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better
may pull the clothes down a bit need to break in the wires has to be looser this is something smallthis does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i dont like to use itoverallprice cheaper now compared to when it first name came out about  lesssound goodjust overall its very goodi would recommend thisi was a bit concerned my older motorola way radio wouldnt work with this product so took a chance but works flawlessly and have purchased a second one for skiingpurchased for the motorola msr mile talkabout waterproof way radios the mic comes in handy if you keep the radios on you hipi got these for my hunting radios they work great and make suiting up easy radio chest pocket mic on your lapel good to gojust one thing that little made in china badge on it errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrri am impressed with this speakermic
im a first responder so i was interested in getting something like what i have at work for my family radios
the mic is very sensitive so have it about  away from your mouth and talk normally they will hear you fine
the weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what i have at work
i can tell that this is a motorola productthese mics are pretty legitspeaker qualitythe speaker quality is pretty good just as long the user on the other end does their part in speaking into the mic correctly
i have the mrr waterproof version and the remote speaker is pretty close to the quality of the handhelds speaker
the remote speaker does have a bit more treble to it but not bad enough to where its a problemdurabilitythe plastic housing isnt the thickest but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement
the feels very sturdy and durable
only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel
some may want this but if it werent as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be betterupdate
i used this remote speaker mic for  days while snowboarding
i wore it on the strap of the backpack where it was exposed to snow and cold constantly
im not the best snowboarder so i was in the snow all over the place
the mic isnt labeled as water proof or even weather resistant but it definitely got wet and still works like a charm
the clip was strong enough and never fell off of the strap even after all of my spills
i love this thing and want to use it every chance i geti have only had it about a week but i needed it to use with my motorola walkie talkie
i walk about  miles a day even in the the cold weather we had this season
my radio kept dieing out when i tried to use it to talk to my husband on my walk from home to a high school on the other side of i here in redford mi
the cold was a major factor and i tried insulating the radio but it still was dieing out a few days after recharging my batteries
i could have recharged the batteries every couple of days that would have helped but i try to let them run down before charging
plus pushing the button is cumbersome with a hand that has to have both a glove and a mitten on to keep reasonably warm
i did buy another small set that had an earphone but the sound was not loud enough i may have dome some damage to that set that caused that problem dont know but needed to try something a little more workable so we bought this and i clip it on the pocket just below my collar and put the radio inside my coat which is in the middle of the coat above my waist
so i was able to find a good position for everything and so far this has been my best solution
i will probably even use it in the summer because of the ease of use
my husbands voice comes in loud and clear and it is minimum inconvenience to push the button even with a double protected hand
the button is longer than the one with the earphone it works greatthis mic is perfect for the person who must have hisher hands free a majority of the time
i use it on an older motorola t radio
the mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt
the speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the ppt button on the mic is easy to use
the connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect
a small tie wrap wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issuei havent had a chance to use the casettes yet but since they are brand new in an unopened factory package i am sure they are just fine
im just glad they got here quicklywhat can i say about this product fair price and gets job done
seems to outlast competition with repeated usesomeone borrowed my sony mini tape recorder to get some detailed infomation and asked if they could keep the tape
i assured them that was fine i would just buy some
boy was i surprised when i checked out all the local stores to find that all that was available was digital recorders
so i checked out amazon and there they wereso thanks for the variey of products supplied by the sellers on amazoncomfor several years my brother had a similar though significantly less durable incar trash bag
it was slightly larger but not having the elastic top simply spilled things if you filled it up
the velcro on the bottom also wasnt foldover like this
not that i intend to try myself but ive seen liquid poured into these with little to no leakage
thats wonderful
heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an almost empty soda in upside down
lol i also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely
this prevents any spilling and makes for easy disposal
tie the top unvelcro the bottom and slide out your sealed trash bag
works much better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter
also doesnt take up leg room in the passenger seat
excellent product especially from the pricethis bag seems durable the elastic top keeps stuff from flying out and the easy dump bottom makes dumping it in the dumpster easy
what more do you want from a trash bagi bought this to go in my  subaru impreza obs since i needed a new one to replace one that i bought  years ago
this one totally puts that bag to shame as lame as that may sound
the elastic top keeps the trash in and the rolled bottom makes releasing the trash very easy
i appreciate the way that it hangs as well keeping its top frame from being too cumbersome and taking away any of my valuable space inside my compact car
great purchase and for a killer pricegreat solution for my car
it hasnt failed in any way
ive used it for over a year now and would certainly rather have it than noti have tried other bags  this one is unobtrusive so it doesnt detract from the looks of my interior
because it has a cinch top rather than a flap it is easy to drop things into it without being distracted
this is my favorite feature  the hole is big enough to put things in but small enough to keep them there
the small piece of velcro keeps it affixed
my former bag had a long piece and i didnt want to stick that to my nice car  it empties easilyreally this does the trick
i resisted crapping up my car with a trash bag for so long but realized i was crapping up my car with wrappers and other misc trash
this is really goodneat little sw radio
made a great gift
great pricefast deliveryive had a couple of these radios
for the most part ive been really happy for many years
its great for a simple transistor radio type sound quality
i am not a shortwave person so i cannnot comment on that feature
fm and am reception are terrific in orlando
battery life is great too
i have had  of these over  yearsthe first model was used reliably for  years
 of those years were in the bathroom exclusively
i finally wore out its amfmsw selector by sliding it back and forth between am talk and fm stations daily s of times
at that point i bought a secondthis second model had suede inside its leather cover and a cheap shinyish silver finish
the buttons felt cheap and it ran for about  months and completely died no audio no readout dead
the model appeared to be the same but quality was aweful compared to what i had beforei then sought an older smooth leather interior covered model through ebay
it has functioned perfectly for the last few years on a high humidity bath windowsillthe best looking radio in the world you will love it no matter what
handsome little machineive had my radio for about six months now and i could not be happier
it pulls in stations from all over the globe  hours a day
it is easy to use and extremely reliable
i recently took it to mexico with me so i could keep up on us news and it provided me with several us broadcasts
i love this radiothis along with the sony icfg are among the two best portable shortwave radios offered by amazon at this time
both have their advantages and it is up to the user what is most important
the grundig yb is a  fairly easy to use radio that allows the user to punch in the desired  frequency enter it into one of  memories or scan desired bands to find  a station of interest
the grundigs best asset is its great audio
it is  definitely the best audio ive heard from a shortwave portable and makes  listening a real pleasure
if you live or travel to any part of the world  other than europe or eastern north america the grundig yb is the best  you can buy
if you live in one of those two places consider the sony  which has a synch
detector that allows you to reduce interference from  adjacent stations
this is important in areas where there are a high number  of strong stations crowded next to one another
in any case both are well  worth the moneyi have had this for a week and it is the best radio i have ever owned
it is portable and fits very ergonomically friendly into you hands
there are  memory presets
the big shortwave broadcasts bbc radio canada voice of america came in very clear and those are really the only ones worth listening to on a regular basis as most of shortwave is flooded with religious programming and politically slanted news
fm reception is very good and am is about as good as my other radios
the dial light and lcd readout could be stronger and bigger
it comes with an adaptor
sleep timer and alarm works just fine
has two times for gmtutc and local time
it looks great with its platinum case
i highly recommend this
it costs more but if you love radio and want bbc and voa this is the one to getthis is a great radio
it arrived on time
it is everything it said it was and more
i would recommend this radio to everyone
this is my second grundig and i enjoy them bothgreat sensitivity and sound in a small radiovery simple to operateits to be compared with the sony g in choosing a portable its chief competitor
you cant go wrong with either onethe yb audio  is much better than the sony and the operation is easier than the  sonythe interference rejection however is better in the sony because of  the sonys synch detector if interference of strong stations is a  consideration or if selective fading common on shortwave or twilight  am broadcasting where the carrier fades below the sidebands causing  distortion is a problem
this is also solved by synch detectionif  distance daytime am listening is desired the sony with its fast agc is  better than the yb with its slow agc because you can add a mw loop  selectatenna terk loop or radio shack mw loop and tune it  successfully with a fast agc
its difficult to tune with the ybs slow  agc though sometimes you can turn the switch to local and disable the agc  temporarily to do it
slow agc gives you an edge in copying interfering  morse code stations however because the louder station wont modulate the  weaker one on the yb and it will on the sony
for strong stations  pick the yb for the audio
for interference or am distance listening  with a mw loop pick the sonythis radio is easy to use and sounds great
coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good
you also get sideband tuning which youll need if you want to hear ham radio operators
off the built in telescoping antenna i get more strong stations than i have time to listen to
with the supplied aux
antenna reception is noticably improved
it comes with earbud headphones ac adapter and the aux antenna
it also has am and fm reception
fm is stereo with the headphones and is very good quality
it has  built in clocks believe me you want that
 memories and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling
this could be considered an entry level radio but it is sensetive enough that you wont out grow it for a very long timewhile im not exactly a shortwave hobbyist ive used shortwave radios on every one of my travels overseas
that being said the yb  pe is the best sw ive ever had
this grundig brings a lot of features to the table such as digital tuning forty presets great capture of stations and above average sound
ive really enjoyed using the  and its great featuresone complaint i had was that the manual that accompanies it does an inadequate job of explaining some of the functions and the presets are all inclusive that is its forty presets for all bands fmswlwmw rather than per band
but these are small things that shouldnt take away from the overall excellence of the radioim getting ready to go on an extended trip to the third world and the grundig yb pe is at the top of my packing listbought the camera midjune and by late june was covering a national convention requiring daily uploads to webpages
got rave reviews of the images shared
the usb connection is easy and fast
i found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolutionit has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots including some sky photography  sunsets that rival film versionsone does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash cardit came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger  a nice feature
and the amazon price  is at least  less than any other sourcethis would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography who wants a  camera that looks feels  and acts like a familiar  mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computersi bought the kodak dc partially on a whim
i had read reviews of the kodak digital cameras and decided to check the price on amazon  which was  about right
the camera came a few days before i went to a convention in  philadelphia giving me enough time to learn how to use the camerathe  pictures are wonderful and my collegues were amazed that i could show them  the pictures immediately or delete them if the shot was bad
i also did a  few shots using the timer which worked pretty well
following the  convention i was able to put together a quick web site with the pictures  a faster process than waiting for the film to be developed then scanning  the pictures then cropping etcoverall a good combination of  features ease of use and quality picturesthis is the best camera i have seen for the price
it has tons of features
i would highly recommend getting a compact flash card reader so you dont drain your batteries on the camera xfering
also the kodak batteries are the best i have ever used
i would recommended getting the  hour rapid charger kit you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use anotherif you want solid well constructed cable that you are never going to have to think about again then belkin is for you
ive never had one problemif youre not used to working with wires and lengths id suggest measuring something and testing it out on your setup
even at  feet it seemed shorter than i thought it would be
luckily my computer sits right next to my router so i didnt have issues there
it was great to move away from my previous wireless connection to a wired connect
also makes it easier to troubleshoot the network when its acting buggyperfect for small jobs where you dont need all that extra cable
i got two just because they were so cheapfor the price whats not to like
it works as well a more expensive ones and i havent noticed any problems at allmost of the review is copied and pasted from another review i did for a belkin ethernet cable this one being used in the same manner
this shorter one was exactly what i needed for the space in which it is being usedi dont know what else to really say about this or any of the many belkin cables i have bought from amazon except that they work very well for my requirements
this specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box
it did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way but its been fine for my use of it
some people think they are not the best of quality but i have not ever had any go bad or break or not fit correctly
you can get cables even cheaper than these from belkin but i dont trust them the belkin cables here on amazon are still far cheaper than what i have seen in stores and i refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like thisgood value for a lan cable
works as intended and the color is a breath of fresh air compared to the dull white or popping bluecant beat this deal
if you can be sure to let me knowthis was bought after we bought  new laptops that needed wireless and my desktop isnt
just the right size for me to connect to the routeras my modem sits right on top of my computer a three foot cable was the best length for my needs so as to minimize cable clutter behind the computer
connectors fit fine with reliable connections
have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems
this was important as ive had the plastic latch fail on other cat cables from plugging  unpluggingi bought these belkin cables
they are very nice quality
they seem heftier than a lot of the other cables
my system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the  foot roll
he runs them to wall outlets then uses the  foot or  foot snap in cable from the wall to the pc
that way you dont have to buy a  dollar crimping toolyou cant solder these cables
they require a metal to metal contact and leadsolder doesnt qualify
also it is critical to keep them spiraled all the way up to the end
even when attaching instructions call for twisting them right up to the connectionsince the tech instructions tell you to keep them down to under  feet these cables whether they are long or short are in the right lengthsi know amazon doesnt print prices in their reviews but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down
the  foot roll was half again as much locallythese are the category e cables
they give you a better return feed which results in better overall performance
so insist on e instead of just  i initially bought some wall plates from a nation wide electrical supply store that were category  then i returned those for the snap in option category  those were returned also when i went to a nation wide building supply center of all places to go networking and they had the complete leviton line of e accessoriesif i had to do it over again i would still buy the belkin  footers
i dont want to have a  foot roll of ethernet cable hanging aroundthese are tops
gold plated connectors snag free ends that protect that little lock in tab on the ends
you know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire out of a wiring mess and the little tab bends over backwards never to work properly again
well belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that
way to go
highly recommended good stuff for a good pricei have to give belkin credit the cable really does appear snagless
i used this short cable to connect an apple tv directly to router
i try to avoid wireless when i can but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center
the texture of the cables insulation coupled with the cables supple flexibility made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled messthe connection is solid and secure and the locking tab on the connector has a shield to help prevent accidental disconnections
i have had no troubles with the quality of the connection and the apple tv transmits a highdefinition signal every timeat this price the cable is a bargain
for some reason ive seen cat  cable of this length sell for more than  in brickandmortar stores and one time i had to pay the extortionate price because i was in a pinchyou can purchase this cable secure in the knowledge that youre going to get a quality productits a network cable what can i say
it works lol
it would be nice if it had the little cover over the removal prong but its no big dealthis product works as advertised i use it to connect my apple time capsule to a nother component and it did just fineinitially i went to a chain box store and purchased a  foot cat e
the price was then they pushed an extended warranty
needless to say i returned it once this one arrived
pay  or 
thats a no brainerit is a cable
it was nicely made workedworks just fine
it wa slong enough to get where i neededgood enough price nice ends good sheathing not too stiffi have these connected to my server computers switch and nas server
nice short cables so i dont have so much mess around
seem like high quality and they work
what more can you ask from a cablei find belkin cables to be fine for their purposeim not sure how you should rate the length of the cord after all you buy the length you needthe quality is fine and the price reasonable
wish i could say the same about their electronics though
 but thats a different set of reviews sometimeshould have copied my comments from the other cat e cable i endorsedhigh quality product fair price and reliability are the reasons i chose this producti use this to connect my cable box to my router so that i can have a stronger wifi connection in my room and it still works great
remember though that it is a foot cable and be sure to keep that in mind when ordering
 feet was just enough for me so just be carefulgood for short jobs like connecting my nearby printer to my network switch which is itself connected by a very long ethernet cable to the router down the hall in another room
go go belkinbought to connect dvr to wall plug in ordered with  ethernet cable so price was a factor
saved  buying it online versus the store where it was these short cables are perfect for use over the desk without making a mess
i have a small switch where i connect two laptops and one raspberry pi and long cables would make too much clutter
these cables work perfectly fine in my mbit network and should also work witn a gigabit network not tested
overall im very happy with this purchaseits a short ethernet cable only needed it to run between my router and a device practically next to itit works like an ethernet cable shouldrelatively cheapthe snagfree design is better than ive seen on many others
it doesnt cover the tab itself making it hard to release like other cables
i found it quite neat that it just has guards on both sides of the tab that extend a bit past the end of it so that things cant easily snag on the tab and still be very easy to depress when you want to disconnect the cablegreat cable super cheap
i got it for less than  as an add on
cant beat hardwiring game consolesthis item was well made as one would expect
performed well
used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem
this in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles
did the jobthis is a great product for connecting a switch and a router or modem
the connectors are very high qualitygood qualtiy with welldesigned connectors
extremely useful for shortdisstance connections between router and other equipmentpurchased three cables
very satisfiedits a  foot cat  cable that lets my router talk to my switch
no complaints
well i have one
it doesnt clean or cook dinnerim very happy with these cables i used them for connecting my home theatre to the net via a switch i installed in my entertainment center
the wires are made of high quality materials and seem to be working great so farinexpensive but seems to be of good quality
i was looking for a mix of different length cables and these footers fit the bill for some short patch cables into my ethernet switch keeping all my devices happy
good service from amazonthis ethernet cable is the perfect length to connect my surround sound receiver to my home network
it works perfectly and is much less expensive than any offerings from local storesneeded a short cat cable to hook up a tv from a router and this fit the bill perfectly
cable is good quality and works perfectly finethis cord is priced great and is of great quality something that can be pretty much assured when your buying a belkin product
i was looking for cat e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase
i dont regret it
the cable is of good quality and the cablesas advertisedare completely snagless so much so that itll take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer its hooked into
this was actually frustrating for me when i was troubleshooting my router but then became a plus when i realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord
so the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device in this case its probably more convenient to get a snagging one
otherwise known asa regular rj cable
i can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature
oh yeah the length of this cord is a beautiful thing
i got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that i was thrilled when i discovered this on amazon
i had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short so that was actually the deciding factor for me
im happy with this purchasevery nice set of wires i love my purchase
better then the ones you buy in c
stores
i bought  of themi really thought about buying a crimper cable and ends but after adding up the cost it was cheaper to just buy premade cables since i didnt need very many
this cable works fine for my needsdoes what i need it to which is primarily to be a quick disconnect between a coupler and my pc when i dontwant to be onlineused it for my other computer that was just sitting around
works perfectly and seems very durable
cable could be longer thoughneeded a new patch cable and this one was a good buy and works like a charm
no problems with this orderoutside skin appears to be good
ends are solid and pretty well put together
color makes it distinguishable from other cables
skin is obviously thin and would not work outdoors or exposed to weatherthese ft cables are perfect for any networking task
purchased these to replace the  foot ethernet cables taking up all the space in my computer room
using these nice short cables i connected my routers and modem all together much more neatly than i had done using the longer cablesbottom line these work as they should
been using them for about a year with absolutely no problems or complaintsproit worked its blue and matches my linksys routers what more can you say about a cable
came in a pretty package using in a power over ethernet poe applicationconsnoneive used this cable to connect a wifi router to a lan net and even with regular unplugging and plugging for thunderstorms it has given me no trouble and always supplied a reliable connectionmy modem sits right on top of my desktop tower so i needed the smallest ethernet cable i could find and this was it
superbgot several of these  foot rg cat  patch cable to hook up the connections on my home network distribution panel
i like these over the stiffer and inflexible yellow patch cables which were way too long
these footers are just the right length and much more flexible to route it around the  distribution framethis is a typical cat cable  nothing special or fancy but it works
it seems more durable than other crap ones ive used just in that the locking tab that holds it in the jack hasnt broken off after extensive usemy ethernet wire broke
the wire i used to connect my verizon modem to my linksys router so i got this one and it works fine
i would have liked them to specify ethernet in the description cause im not familiar with the terminology and wasnt sure it was the same wire i had that needing replacing
i finally looked up cate on the web and found a site that called it an ethernet wire so i came back here and bought itworks as good as any cable you can buy in your local store just at a much cheaper pricethis was exactly the length i needed from my modem to my router
its been perfect since i received it
internet hasnt disconnected oncecame on time and the cable works just finenothing fancy here just a well made product
the price is right and it works flawlessly
i will buy againwith no wireless where i work a cable is required to use the internetthis is the best buy i foundi had problems finding a foot cable not wanting cable all over the deskwhat i found was  elsewhere this is the best buyyes it works without any problemsthis ended up being alot shorter than what i needed but im sure i will find some use for it in the future very nice looking and well put togetherthis is a quick fix for a small cable problem
fast service to repair a cable connection that was brokeni needed a patch cable and this one is great quality
the price on amazon is a fraction of what you will pay for this same item at best buyworks just fine nice blue color and no trees in the rain forest were used in the manufacturing of the product
not much else to sayi bought these a while ago just to bump up my overall purchase to the  at the time minimum to receive free shipping
not an exciting purchase but functional as i bring up more devices between my patch panel and main switchill make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works
first and foremost  it works and works well
it may be only be  feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as i need it
if i were lucid when i measured the location i would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what i needed at the time and now the length is perfect
i have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but not this belkin
it is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient
those elements alone would be worth buying this cable however when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and i highly recommend it under any circumstances that workits a cable
it worked
it was long enough
should of made my own but customer wanted blue
two more wordsgood quality low price and the cables worked as expected
that is all you can as for from a network cablethis ethernet cable isnt long and it isnt fancy
however it has a solid build quality and should last you for years
great for running in between a router and a closet computerthe merchant got this cat e cable to me quickly
its well built doesnt kink and i like blue
greatdoes what its supposed to dothanks to everyone that takes the time to review products
it is a big helpto reduce clutter behind the scene with colors to help color coordinate the herd gathering behind your electronic devices does the job nicely cable is high quality and easy to route
would buy a bunch more if i needed themthe cable length is what i was looking for and these are priced pretty more than well for what i neededi bought a few of these along with some   and  ft cables as part of my home surveillance project a while backtheres very little that could impress you about a ft cable but i will say that belkin in general provides great cat cable at extremely good pricesim a belkin customer for lifethese are great for completing a distribution panel  long enough to reach from corner to corner but easy enough to coil if the connection is much closerok so it didnt disintegrate when i opened the package
the twisty ties were twisty and tied
the clips on both ends clipped properly
it did not break the first time i used it
it didnt break when i had to unplug and replug it
it fits most brands of cable management systems
and data flows through it nicelyi love itif you do wired networking you will know that there is no such thing as too many patch cables
usually the ones you have are much too long  hence my seeking  ordering these shorter cables
certainly as good quality as any others and way way cheaper than i have seen in any retail storesturdy takes being stepped on etc
the color helps me differentiate one line from another
good connections
what else is therealways great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable
belkins products are very consistent in both quality and price
they hit it all with this one
we have used several of these at workbest cable ive ever purchaseddoesnt get all tangled like others do
should last longer than others ive purchased
will buy more as need ariseswe needed to hook two computers up to an ethernet switch box
this short cable was just the right size for the computer which sat next to the switch box
very sturdy cable and the clips on the ends look like theyll last a long timeyou can feel that this cable is made to last
it ahs durabel tips and they feel strong
this works well with all our needsits a cate cable
its three feet long and black
it worked exactly as described to connect my kenwood d head unit to the main body of the radioneeded a new one
came brand new in packaging
works great
great buy for the money great product still use it todaypatch cord was well constructed
perfect in patch panels and in home networks
rubber coating looks to be very durablelike the title suggests why would any comsumer want to pay more for a product that does exactly the same thing
sure there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery but theyll have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference
belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price
i would buy and will buy these cables again and againthis ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm
had it for  years and have never had a problem with iti replace my cables every few years my cable was going out so i placed it with this things are working so much better nowsped up my internet connection by simply buying this cord
i had had no idea that the cord itself could make connection slow and this was a bargain compared to getting a new modem
snagless however means that youll never again get it wrapped as tightly as it appears in the photo
this thing is fairly stiff and it likes to stay straight
just another in the coil of snakes on the back of the desk but its a very good cordpurchased this to connect a switch to a  port router for extra expandability
there is not much to say here other than if you are looking for a short cable to keep cords clean then look no furtherit is well made soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic
the length is about right for a patch cordfor ethernet cables i dont need fancy smancy cables to get the job done
these are good and very inexpensivegood quality and you cant beat the price
bestbuy gets about  for a similar cable
i would buy it againthese do exactly what you need them to do
what more can you ask for from patch cables
great quality from belkini have never bought a belkin product i wasnt satisfied with
this is no exception
not that i really give this cord any thought now that its in use but that is the point isnt it
i guess the only other thing to say is that being blue its easy to find in the mass of cords around my tv and computer areanot much to review here
item was as advertised and worked without problem
the plugs have a guard over the lever which helps keep the snap tab from breaking offwell constructed cable it is very flexible making it easy to run where you want iti recently ordered this ethernet cable due to mine being so old and long
this cable is the perfect size works admirably and i received it within a week at a great pricethx u so much
as always ill continue to shop online at amazon in the futurenice looking cat  cable and the length is perfect for most devices
i wish they made several different colors instead of white and black then you could trace what port and what device it powersi find it hard to say i love it about a network cable but they are of fine quality so they deserve a 
 feet is pretty short  turns out a little too short for my application  so be sure thats what you needits a good cable
not much you can say about a ethernet cable
it works greathigh quality build
i would recommend this cable to anyonehey its an ethernet cable  these things either works or they dont
this one worked fine for me to connect to home routerwhat you see is what you get
just your average cate cable
good for ethernet connections up to  feetgreat price for a genuine belkin cate patch cable
the packaging is minimal which is a plus since its just a cable
i ordered a few
they all worked perfectlyi need a small cable to run from my tv to my zyxel wap and this did the tick
seam to be high qty i tend to like belkin productsyoud think all ethernet cables are the same but after installing thousands of preterminated cables in my profession you get a good intuition of whats good and whats not
these cables are certainly well made and reliable and an important part of any network
you wont have any issues with this one so stock up and dont worry about connectivity issuescables showed up exactly like i expected them
packaged neatly and correctly
i honestly dont know what else to say they are exactly as advertisedthis produce is well made is from a good company and works as stated very well
this item came in a very short timne and was all i had expectedmost people will tell you a cable is a cable
after dealing with so many different brands i have concluded that it is not true
this cable is very easy to manage on a patch panel
i am completely sold on belkin cablesethernet cables work very  well with my xboxthey looks great and i hope the color  of the itemsthanks so muchnot a whole lot to say here
they are good cables good price and arrived quickly
i would recommend them to a friendif theres one thing i dislike about ethernet cords its the price that some companies try to charge for them
i have unfortunately shelled out  for a  foot ethernet in the past thinking it was the price i had to pay
either this price is outrageous or the sellers online are crazyafter buying a switch for my college dorm room i needed an extra ethernet cord
since the switch box was about a foot from the ethernet plug i needed a small length and  feet seemed adequatethis light blue cord is exactly what i needed and is listed at an exceptional 
with amazon prime this is like spending the quarters you find in your couch cushionsi always recommend buying ethernet cords or  of products online
the deals are too good to pass upthis ethernet patch cable works great
i have no problems with the signal running through it
it seems like a solid well constructed cable
the cable i got is as specified in the product descriptioni needed a cable to connect a new ethernet switch to a modem and this fits the bill perfectly
just as describedi love this patch cable it works great and better than the after market i had speed is faster and better shipment was fast thank for a great productwhat more can you ask for but a high quality low cost ethernet cable
they work and i am happyvery fast service
exactly what i orderedi am never disappointed with belkin productswill use technology galaxy againthank youi ordered these because most you find are  feet long and i dont want all that cable hanging everywhere because i have cats that will try to play with it and then all my equipment ends up on the floor
not now because since i found these on amazon they have not touched themit is a  foot ethernet cordit works its blue it gets  stars
i have to type a few more words to give it a reviewi ordered a longer version of this exact cable last year to connect my cable modem to my desktop computer
i was so impressed with the make and quality of it that when i bought a valet router i decided the cat  cable supplied with it was not up to the standard i expected
i bought the  foot one to connect my router to the modem
i really wasnt expecting much as far as improved performance but i am keeping a full wifi signal on my phone now while previously only having  of  bars showing up
could be the shorter cord could be better quality im not really one to say since im no pro with these things but it has improved my routers signal
one piece of advice if youre using more than one get a different color
i wasnt thinking and prefer the blue cord so i ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product
since i do occasionally plug my modem directly into the pc instead of through the router i ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so i know which is which
the snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern i had with the cable that came with the router since i could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging
wouldnt usually write a review for a cord but this one has enough going for it that i think it deserves all the praise it can getgood quality cable
i would recommend them to anyone looking for a good cheap patch cable
i bought them to replace some home made cables and they work perfectlythis wire does the trick for my portable wifi router without having to lug around a long cable
the three foot length is just righti connect a long ethernet wire to tplink tlsfd port mbps desktop switch which inturn uses  of these belkin ethernet cables to connect all my devices and they work perfectlyi connect my tv xone and ps and all of them work at full speedi needed a few extra cat e cables to hook up some devices to my home network
i found these cables on here at what i thought was a ridiculous price and though the price made me wonder would the things even work when i got then i should never have worried
they worked like a charmfor someone like me who isnt going to buy a roll of cat cable at home depot and make my own network lines these worked greathighly recommendi saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this
i am happy to report that it was in fact  feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer
the price was great the big box store wanted  for a  foot cordthis is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture
i recommend the producti just installed a network between my two home computers and this cable did the job perfectly
it worked just like it is supposed to and the ft length gave me all the cable i needed with plenty left in case i decide to rearrange the desk locations
well worth the  priceit works its snagless
perhaps with some high end test equipment i could find a flaw but none are visible by me
five starsbelkin is a classy company indeed
i am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the r jack broke off after about  months of heavy use
went to their website put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day no questions asked
sweetupdate  belkin now makes aft cat black patch cable snagless rjmrjmthat is better made transmits data faster and supports  mbps networks and probably best of all is cheaperi bought these belkin cables
they are very nice quality
they seem heftier than a lot of the other cables
my system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the  foot roll
he runs them to wall outlets then uses the  foot or  foot snap in cable from the wall to the pc
that way you dont have to buy a  dollar crimping toolyou cant solder these cables
they require a metal to metal contact and leadsolder doesnt qualify
also it is critical to keep them spiraled all the way up to the end
even when attaching instructions call for twisting them right up to the connectionsince the tech instructions tell you to keep them down to under  feet these cables whether they are long or short are in the right lengthsi know amazon doesnt print prices in their reviews but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down
the  foot roll was half again as much locallythese are the category e cables
they give you a better return feed which results in better overall performance
so insist on e instead of just  i initially bought some wall plates from radio shack that were category  then i returned those for the snap in option category  those were returned also when i went to home depot of all places to go networking and they had the complete leviton line of e accessoriesif i had to do it over again i would still buy the belkin  footers
i dont want to have a  foot roll of ethernet cable hanging aroundthese are tops
gold plated connectors snag free ends that protect that little lock in tab on the ends
you know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire out of a wiring mess and the little tab bends over backwards never to work properly again
well belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that
way to go
highly recommended good stuff for a good priceusing this cable to connect my ps to the router and its working fine
i dont know my upload or download speeds but playing movies off netflix and playing games online has been trouble freewe got one spare computer table in the room and just  minutes ago i set up everything and works perfectly
it is connected to our router in the living room and right now i am  playing the music player on our xbox accessing my mp songs on this computer
so happy with this belkin ethernet cable
oh another thing its wires arent awkwardly bent like other cables after you remove it from its packagingthese where exactly what i needed for my bluray player
the price was great and could not be beat at any store that i looked atif you just need to connect a router or switch and dont want to bother about making your own cables this is a great option
certainly pricey for what it is but the snagless design is very solid and you wont have to worry about bad cables as these are all prechecked for youone small quibble is that the snagless housing makes for a big cable end which could become problematic if you are plugging many cables into a small hub
otherwise greatcable is high quality was shipped on time and packaged well
i have used cheaper cables but they are not as wellmade and durable as this belkin cabletheres not much to say
this cable does the job intended and works just fine
considering the price its a great buyita a cable it does what it supposed to do and does it good been doing it for a while now and hope keeps on doing seems like it like what its doingwhile it seems silly to sit and glorify the merits of a cable the belkin series of cables are truly great
i have a number of varieties of them and they are all excellent  well made work great and the snagless aspect actually is qite good
good connectors that wont break soon tooi use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to mei bought this to connect another pc to the router and this cable made installation easy
was able to run it from the router through a floor hole across the basement and up through a hole near the additional pc with no kinks twists snags or curls
the pvc jacket is solid and thick for excellent protection and yet the cable remains flexible so i was able to bend it through some pretty tight spacesbig plus the strain relief on the rj plug helps protect the locking tab from snapping off
the plugs fit into the jacks with barely any wiggle so it makes solid contact
and ive had some bad experiences with cheapo illfitting rj plugs from other sources
im looking at you radio shack
i like this cable and highly recommend itgreat quality cable i wouldnt buy anything of a lesser quality and it has the stubs on the end to protect the connector that often breaks offi bought it to hook up my xbox  to my computer
it works great and i did not have to spend  on a wirelessthis product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system
i highly recommend this cablei snaked it through a wall
the ends held up just fine
my media pc has excellent internet connection through fioswhat can i sayit is cable
it is long it is blue it does its job and the price was rightid not going to go nuts here  i mean its just a cable
but ft of cat at the oxymoronic best buy would mean unloading your wallet so  is a reasonable price and the cable has been working fine ever sincethis is just what it says it is
a good moderate cost cable for joining parts of an ethernet network
the connectors are large enough to grasp easily and they are snag proof as you pull them around furniture etci bought this ethernet cord for my home network and it has worked flawlessly
not much else i can sayit works as you would expect it to and the price is greatworks great but im not too sure what snagless molded patch means but definitely able to hook my desktop into my router
i wish they had black thoughi wanted to buy a good cable not a cheap one and this one seems to be made well and is working goodvery sturdy just what i needed since my pc does not like to go wireless all the time
i just keep it plugged in with this chord and all is good
and when my mac has issues with wireless i can give it a turnused this to hook up wired router for nd computer
it is a quality productft for 
what else needs to be saidthis cable is every bit as good as the  bundles youll see at office depot
i bought about  of these and every one of them works great
i have my home security system wired up on this particular cableits a great buy and im a belkin customer for life nowthe cable worked was able to negotiate a gigabit connection as expected
theres not much more to saypriced right and worked flawlessly i recommend this item for home networking and will use again in the futurethis cable was received neatly coiled with twistties in a retail package
the connectors which are already applied will not loosen over time like manually pinned out cables will have a special design to protect the security clip from breaking off
this allows the rj connectors to fit firmly in place and not fall out of the network portbelkin is a recognized brand for premium cables
even though this is a name brand cable the price was comparable to other similar cables making this purchase a clear best choiceits very blue and does not snag even if you try
i really like how blue it is and it also works welli opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers
it is the cable ends that are usually of concern
the belkin cables are fine
the ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely
i have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router
it is functioning just finei am using several belkin patch cables along with this one
they all work as advertised have a good design on the connectors and come with a lifetime warrantygotta put in  words  so what can i say it is a pre made item made by a great cable maker so this thing will work great and it was a great price  usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my networkworks perfectly
great value
connecting internet modem to tv in living room via basement in order to use netflixpandora
blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other linesyup they connect my cable modem to my router and my router to my computers
they transmit data back and forth
so far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye
so go patch cables yaythis ft cable is flawless snagless no more kinks in the cablethe connectors are nice and soft and i love the blue colorthis cable works like a charm and well worth the price at ft lengthhighly recommended  cheaper than radio shacki needed a cable to go across my house and this one did that job fine
i was really afraid i would have to pay a lot of money for a  cable but this cable proved me wrong
it is not expensive
the snagless connectors were very useful when i was dragging the wire under my floors though some tape probably could have done the job
i have not noticed any loss in performance because of this cablecable worked great will buy again when i need another cable
very durable and works like it shouldwould recommend if you need a dsl cablereceived these  quickly packed well in belkin packaging
snaked thes thru walls and got a tight connection with nice signal strength
i needed the 
glad that i didnt go with my first assessment of all was right with the ordering packaging and deliveryran from dsl router to computer and rokuthis cable is such a great price that that alone is a great reason to buy it it helped me extend the distance of my signal without the cost of having to buy a signal boosterhave been using this cable for  months now with zero problems
ive got it running thru my apartment because our router is in my roommates room
a quality cable that is reliable and dependable
i love itprompt delivery
the extension cord allows me the extra length i sometimes need when i must be away from my desk while teaching and using my ipadi used this for a server i have running in a corner of the room away from my pc
i plugged this into one monitor port and now i dont have to use a finicky remote control software to access the pc
the cable is good quality and provides a clear image of the screengreat price and it did exactly what i needed it to do
if you need to make your cord stretch after rearranging some furniture this works fantasticordered a few of these they work great
perform like the newest cables with out the cost
a true buythis was not the right cable i needed so cannot give it a glowing report
returned it and bought the right hdmi cablemy projector universal port adapter was only  ft long
this was an excellent addition
now my computer does not have to sit so close to the projectori need a malefemale cable to use with a vga extender
i didnt realize until i received the cable that the fastening posts actually prevented the cable from connecting because any vga outlet would not accommodate that
i decided to take my chances with a hack saw and successfully and easily removed the posts from the female end
the posts are only needed if using as an actual extension to prevent the cables from being pulled apart
it worked great for my applicationin this review i was asked to rate  stars on this products ease of use and sound quality  i have no idea why as this is strictly a visual productanyway  i use this male to female vga monitor extension cable to extend another  vga cable which connects my laptop to my  lcd tv
i would say i am very discerning when it comes to assessing audiovideo quality and still feel the picture is nearly perfect
it does what it is supposed to without any detectable degrading to the image quality or noise
the build feels solid and at the same time not too rigid
i am very happy with this product
updatethis and the other cable i bought at the same time  years ago both seem to be working well
neither has seen heavy abuse so i cant attest to its roadworthiness but in my home it still carries a strong clear signalthe screws to tighten the plug feel cheap but the cable works just fine
im using it for an old  monitor and the picture looks just dandybelkin isnt high in terms of consumer name recognition  but they produce a pretty wide range of products
cables to routers
ive never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably
this cable is another one of those products
a simple product vga extension cord  but it needs to work reliably
this cable was nearly the least expensive one available  and it works well  as expected with higher resolution
id buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorsei was looking for an extension for my tvmonitor in the living room when i found this one i have bougth belkin products before and have had good luck with them this was a very good buy for the price better than going to the retail stores and buying therepurchased to use second monitor on my pc
configuration of my setup required a longer vga cable
does the job perfectlyif you have to run a legacy dos program its getting progressively harder to find these thingstheres also the issue of a maximum length for a functional parallel cable before things start malfunctioningthis one works just fine and is inexpensive as well
so how much more can one rave about a rather intentionally mundane objectwith my setup i have my printer and a zip drive running off the same cable and since i bought this belkin cable i havent had any problems
it is also very easy to screw and unscrew onto the computer as it has  different knobs than the standard printer cablethis extra long  cable enabled me to relocate my printer to a more covenient location in my home office a costeffective cable
i needed to connect my ancient but underused hp laser jetii printer to my modern computers that still have a parallel port
id considered using a usbtoparallel cord or a usbtoparallel adapter converter but some of these have hitormiss reviews on this site so i decided to go with this older solution
rare mention of a ljii out there too
the result is i can now use the ljii which still works splendidly with either of  desktops or with my windows xp laptop
the proper drivers install quickly and printing seems quick enough in short  recommendedthis item is perfect for those of you who still have older hp workhorse laser printers
thick construction and super long cableworked perfectly to run from a desk around a wall to an oki dotmatrix impact printer
not a single problem
typical great belkin qualityexcellent speaker system for the price
extraordinary sound and great bass
fully recomended to anyone shopping for computer speakerslet me preface this review these speakers are not for the audiophile
if you want high end sound completely distortion free at full volume with a treble that can call in the dogs from a mile away and a bass that can rattle cracks in your houses foundation these are not the speakers for youbut if you dont want to spend a lot of money and you still want reasonable quality these speakers are a good buy
given the price of these speakers i must say i was amazed at the sheer clarity of the sound
i tested them with my car cd player and they played everything from classical beethoven to classic rock with alaming precision
they worked equally well on my computer for cds mps and dvds
the bass was separately adjustablea plus at this price rangeand the apparatus was easy to set upi did not experience audible hiss that was noted by some of the reviewers but at higher end of the volume setting the higher sounds tended to fray and the bass became a little muddy
no matter
this is not the speaker set up for a large room or a home theater
these are personal speakers that will function best in a small room or office and they pack more than enough punch for this venuemy five star rating reflects the quality of the product given its price
i have listened to other speakers by boston acoustics altec lansing and yamaha that were bought for almost double this price that did not sound as good as these
once again this is not audiophile sound but who can expect that in this price range
i highly recommend them for the basic user who does not want to pay a premium for premium soundthese speakers are great great sound from a cheap sound card full sound and powerthe cambridge soundworks pcworks speaker system was designed by audio hall of fame member henry kloss and made in partnership with creative labs the company that also manufactures soundblaster audio cards for pcs
simply put this compact computer speaker system is an absolute dynamo
it consists of two inch x inch x inch satellite cubes a inch x inch x inch subwoofer unit and a wired remote volume control unit
the subwoofer is the central unit in the system
in addition to pumping out a deep mellifluous natural sounding bass into the room it provides amplification for the satellitesit doesnt take  long at all to get the cambridge soundworks pcworks speaker system set up and running
heres all you have to do connect one of the volume controllers foot leads to the computers quotaudio outquot port and the other lead to the subwoofer
 connect each satellites foot lead to the subwoofer
 plug the subwoofer into household current
 as the instruction manual points out the human ear cant distinguish the location of bass frequencies so subwoofer placement is not critical
i suggest placing it on or near the floor on a lowlying shelf
for best results dont  place anything within  inches directly in front of the subwooferafter setting up my cambridge soundworks pcworks speakers i really put them through their paces
i test drove them with music as diverse as beethovens quotspringquot violin sonata and quotthe best of the guess whoquot  i played a variety of computer games
and i watched the movie quotgladiatorquot in my computers dvd player
in all cases the sound from these little cambridge soundworks pcworks gems was simply magnificent at all times crisp clear well balanced and natural
never  any distortion fuzziness or clipping regardless of how loud i set the volumei quotdiscoveredquot cambridge soundworks speaker systems a couple  years ago when i bought an quotensemble ivquot satellitesubwoofer system for my stereo
when i first bought it i was amazed at the sound quality that emanated from that miniature dynamo two years later im still amazedthe cambridge soundworks pcworks is as good as my quotensemble ivquot system in fact i rate it as the best computer speaker system ive ever heard
considering its very inexpensive price tag it also a system that packs a huge quotbang for the buckquot for consumersso if youre looking for a new computer speaker system that will bring your games music and movies alive look no farther that cambridge soundworks pcworks
go ahead buy em and set em up then kick back and enjoy the musicim no audiophile
increasingly my music is stored in the form of   khz mps so i can take it with me or put it in very large playlists on my  computer
that implies some small amount of loss of sound quality
im  the kind of guy whos happy to live with thatthat having been said  these speakers are ideal for the purpose
after sidebyside comparing  them at a store with several other more mainstream brands i was impressed  at the amount of what those audiophile glossies call presence especially  at the low volumes appropriate for apartment dwelling
beat the altec and  labtec speakers hollow  dunno why particularly
a bose system was a  little better  and about  times the pricethe large subwoofer only  gets frequencies that your brains spatial localization system mediated by  the lateral lemniscus gt superior olivary nucleus pathways if there are  any neuroscientists reading this isnt equipped to deal with
so set it  under your desk put the little  inch cubes on your desk or hang em from  something with the included sided tape each weighs about an oz
and get  ready for great sound at a great price
i originally bought a set for my  computer but went ahead and bought extra sets for every room in my home  including the bathroom so i can have hour music now if i want
the  price is right to do thatthis is an incredible camera especially in regard to its lowlight capabilities
i used mine for years but as windows os versions changed the camera became less and less cooperative with the pc and with windows  finally stopped working completely
it didnt do that well with xp eitherso if youre running an os older than xp you cant go wrong with this camera especially at this pricethese webcams are excellent and it is a shame that they no longer make these web cams anymore you will be able to buy them from auction sites eg ebay or here at amazon but most likely you will have to search endlessly for the drivers of the item
when you find the drivers that you need to run this item you will find an excellent high quality webcam and worth the price
i use webcams for a living conference callsetc and own topoftheline video conferencing cameras and for the price of these cameras they are worth itif you need a camera that takes higher quality and higher resolution photos in all kinds of light you will need this camera
the com homeconnect has remarkable lowlight capability
i use it as a quotweather camquot  it is pointed out the window of my office in edinburgh indiana where it adapts well to everything from bright sunlight to ambient street lighting at night
unlike most webcams this one features a resolution as high as x
i also like the long detachable usb cord
another plus is the easy setup  utility
basically all you do is put the cd in the drive and it tells you  onscreen what to do next
its so simple
just dont plug the camera into  the usb port before the program instructs you to do so
its not the least  expensive camera on the market but the extra price gets you a much better  camera than the average webcamalthough it says that the camera is not windows certified when it is being stalled i have no problem whatsoever
i got the latest driver from vividcommunicationscomi have no idea why some people report lowlight problem or color problems but this camera is the best that ive used in term of clarity and lowlight capability
i think once you figure out how to set this camera up youd enjoy this camerawith interchangable lenses the camera can cover a wide range of anglesas for mounting i went to best buy and got a pair of speaker wall mounts for about  which provides all the adjustment angles youd need
you only need one mount for each camera but have to buy them in pairs as they are made for speakersgood luck to those who are getting a webcam
if you need more info on the mount just contact mefar better resolution and optical quality than more recent webcams these com computer video cameras are still useful many years after being discontinued
at the time they were available with interchangeable focal length lenses as well
worth seeking outi was nervous buying this camera as i had read horror stories of how people couldnt get to install this on their computers
but i was hooked to this cameras response to low light and went ahead and bought it
i made  sure i stuck to the installation sequence software tests first installs  drivers and then you hook up the camera on reboot and it worked
not only  that this is a twain compatible device and i got it to work smoothly with  adobe photoshop  and premier  this deal is worth the risk
picture  and video quality is really good and even better than the ones that come  out of the sgi video cameras supposedly the graphics powerhorseshighquality stylus  of them even
they even seem better than the one that was actually included with my palm pilot
a stylus is an easy thing to misplace lose just like a pen so its great to have a few in your briefcase or pursethe stylus fits perfectly in my antiquated palm pilot and i really like the weight of the stylus
my pda might be old but it works for me
thank you very muchyour palm v probably came with two  one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm and one all plastic
these are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your palm
thats about  itfor the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in  case
you can also keep a spare in each car or whateverthe usb version of the dazzle dm video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the mpeg format in real time
this format plays back well on modern pc and mac computers but doesnt take up too much hard drive space
the quality isnt as good as a professional encoder but then  it costs about a tenth of the priceobviously there must have been an issue with a lot of the players that were made with this model  but i havent seen it
ive had the player for  years  and never had one issue with it
its the first and only stand alone dvd player ive had and works wonderfully
i also own  sony tvs a sony reciever and vcr and satellite system and havent once had an issue
i think that sony has continued their product quality no matter where theyre builti bought this dvd from amazon in november have watched wellover  dvds see why later and played a lot of cds
nolipsync
the cd sounds even better than my other cd deck
what i like most is the headphone jack that allows me to listen to cd and watch dvd just with the dvd machine powered on without disturbing others
now the best part that even amazon staff does not know
this machine qualifies for  free dvds and  free rental  from netflix  from blockbuster via sony coupon and  from blockbuster  program
i waited until now to write this comment because i want to verify the above
i got all that
what can i say outstanding picture gorgeous sound i had a full  speakers sound system mated to a x watts dolby digital dts receiver and all the freebies listed above
you must be nut for buying any other dvd brand
after all this is a sonythis is a great machine all around
what puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the dvd menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit
it even has a jogshuttle dial on the unit for still pause and frame advance which is very smooth
this unit even has a builtin  dolby digital decoder for  upgradable receivers
you get a choice of composite s or component video outputs
the remote works on all sony tvs
very very good for the moneyi bought a sony  in  and have had no lipsync problems at all
the only problem i have noticed is that a disc is supposed to resume from the point you stopped when you push quotstopquot and the display says  quotresumequot  mine does not do this consistently and never seems to  do it with cd but perhaps this feature does not work with cd
aside from  that one baffling inconsistency i love my   i have it hooked into a  yamaha dolby digital quotreadyquot receiver and find that the bass  management controls in the sony  are excellent for setting up my system
i have a full surround system using all paradigm monitor series speakers  and the sound from the  when used as a cd player is so clear that you  can hear individual string plucks on guitar and other details you dont  often hear
the picture quality is so superior to vhs that i can scarcely  stand to watch vhs anymore
when it comes to video products and  particularly digital video you cant beat sony
dont waste your money  trying any other brands
youll just wish you had bought sony to begin  withthe dvd player is great
perfect midrange player with a good mix of features vs price
did notice a lipsync problem with one dvd but it has not occurred in the past month or two but i shall keep watching for  itif you get this dvd player you will not be disappointedthe quotlipsynchquot problem has shown up on my d model once while watching over  moviesother than this issue the dvd player rates  starsi have to assume that the lipsynch problem referred to inearlier reviews must have been taken care of because i haventencountered the slightest problem
the video quality is simply astonishing  i won my wife over by doing a direct comparison with the laserdisc and dvd versions of quotgone with the windquot  she is  sold now
theres enough flexibility that you can upgrade to a componentvideocapable tv if you dont have one now im using the svideo output and that blows me away
the remote has excellent human factors engineering  i have no trouble using it in a dimlylit room for the usual functions pause slow forwardbackwards fast etc
plus some handy features like quothow much time is left on the moviequot menu access is simple and intuitive too  no teenytiny pixiesized buttons to feel around for
full  outputs and dtsdolby digital if you can use them and a host of options for the twothree speaker folks
really this has everything you could ask for in a player in this price range  i dont know who selected the toshiba as amazons pick but this is really the one you wantafter reading every review we could find we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the olympus r digital camera
we were definitely not disappointedafter just a few days the  camera accompanied us to ulaanbaatar mongolia and seoul s korea while  we nervously left our canon slr at home
the camera performed marvelously
we found the optional mb flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptopwe were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings
we took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable
while staying in the  countryside in a traditional mongolian quotgerquot tent we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishablearriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our hp  deskjet  using an epson photographic paper
i doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot
the enclosed olympus and adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use
you will absolutely love the quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shotsone of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one
if you frame say a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area
olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfindersapart from that you will want to invest  in the nimh charger and at least  batteries shop around for the best  price
also picking up a  inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver
you simply pull out the flash memory card  slip it into the adapter and then slide the floppy into any computer
youll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table plus a significant download timeone last item do you think a  mb memory card will be too small for your needs
olympus through their  website is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of december  that will allow the camera to use the new mb memory cardsthe olympus dr is in my opinion the best value digital camera available right nowthe picture quality is impressivei usually cant tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a  slr that i have scanned inalso the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use like a good point and shoot camera  should besince i bought my olympus i have not taken  nondigital  photograph
i enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs some rolloverall the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photographyi have owned an olympus  for two years and ive been very happy with itbut i recently upgrade to the olympus  because the  just couldnt give me the printquality i was looking for
frame a photo from the  and you can tell it is a digital photo
frame a photo from the  and you would never know it was digital
so i love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if i liked a digital camera more than my old mm
but two years later ive found the need to upgrade
however due to the significant price jump the comparisons to the  are not totally fair
so i still give the  a rating of  stars because for the price i think it is a great optioni posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago shortly after purchasing it
i gave it  stars mainly because the manual wasnt well written
however that still being the case i must say that this camera deserves  stars
it takes amazingly clear bright pictures
the video display lcd  is bright
and it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down
i highly recommend this camera
if it had an optical zoom it  would be perfect
however with this camera you get more than you pay forso many people have written about the technical part of this wonderful camera
i agree with many of them
you wont feel bad about spending your 
ive shopped around and ive made my decison with confidence
yes  you can find this item for less at other estores but i trust amazon they  deliver promptly and their customer service is great
some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy
its only true when you  use the lcd monitor to take pictures
if you use it  for reviewing and  deleting the pictures you have taken it lasts a long long time
i have  purchased my camera before thanksgiving
its december  and after taking  hundreds of pictures most using flash i am still using the batteries it  came with
lemme tell ya a little secret if you do take pictures using  the lcd monitor and you get the message that the battery is low turn off  the camera let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again
the  battery life will show full again
no need to change the batteries until it  tells you its dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder
now it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable nimh batteries
ive seen many good comments about the brand maha
also i have seen great  reviews on mahas charger model mhcf
some people have mentioned them  here
but i didnt know where to purchase them from
so here you go
for  more info on the maha products go to mahacomm website
and to purchase  these two products check out thomasdistributings website sorry i cant  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines but it  isnt hard to figure out
for around  i got the charger and  nimh  batteries
now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them
its a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you dont have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures
just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your tv
or  just use the lcd monitor
   from a happy olympusamazon customerive owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far
i agree with the other customers about the manual it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language not three languages together in one  page
but the camera is very easy to use takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features
with a tripod you can take great pictures at night  without the flash
the software is also very easy to use
although its not  documented in the manual the camera comes with a twain driver so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing softwarethis may have only  mp but it is the best camera ever made in the digital  arena
really
as evidenced by the unusually hi cost in the used camera market for these mp cameras i own  of them and use them for my business
people are always commenting on what great quality photos i produce
the adjustment allows you to take photos in low  pixels so the saved photos wont eat up all the space on your computer or camera card
a note of caution the smart cards with  mpixels that fit this camera are very difficult to find now days and expensive to booti think it wont take over a mp cardthis is a great little camera
a real bargain at this price
excellent color and quality pictures
only drawback is slow serial interface to computer
buy a flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster
a good card reader that wont crash your system  is made by siig
they call it their usb digifilmcombo reader
about   street price
also get the maha charger and nimh batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this pagethis dvd player is great for home or travel
only two little quirks the bottom gets really hot and you cant plug it in to a car outlet
otherwise it is really coolif you like dvd watching on planes or in airports this player is excellent
it does get a little hot but not too bad
the amount you pay for this unit has come down now due to a new model out in a few months with  a  inch screeni love this player
i travel frequently and the l keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the airplane
the folks that make the powerxtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for  the l so you wont need to take extra batteries on those long flights
the screen is very nice looking and the x format lets you view  anamorphic format dvds in their best possible resolution
of course the  wide screen also causes you to curse the dvds that arent anamorphic eg  titanic
the sound from the builtin speakers is ok but sounds very good  from a pair of headphones
for travelers i recommend a pair of the sony  noise cancelling ear budshey this is by far the biggest step up in portable tubevision that will ever happen
great picture and sound quality comes from the  speakers
the only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life
this was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than   hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours
this was  pretty good however and the battery life doesnt hurt the rating for me  since i got the power adapterwe use this when travelling on airlines
but to make it work the very best you need a couple of additional items
  you need good noise cancelling ear phones to get rid of the background noise on airplanes  trains buses cars etc
panasonic model rphc or similar
  you  need a splitter so that two of you if you have a significant other can  watch the movie together
radio shack then all you need to bring is  popcorn
  for those long flights youll need one or two extra  batteries
the battery that comes with it will play for about three  hours
it takes a long time to charge these batteries about four hours  so be prepared
enjoyi absolutely love this product
the picture and sound are both great
the unit comes with enough cables to get you hooked into a tv
it even has on optical out so you hifi buffs will enjoy pure digitali travel  quite a bit and this thing has been great for occupying my timeas far  as not using it on an airplane i disagree
i beleive the line goes  quotportable electronic devices may now be used with the expection of  cellular phones and pagersquot  most all laptops have cdroms and they  have not been the cause of any plane crashes to datein summary if you  travel a lot get it but shop around for the best dealso far soo good it works and run like a power battery
if you like power this is a must buyi bought two of these batteries with the overnight nimh family battery charger and so far the batteries have performed as expected
havent used it enough to see if they take memory if charged to frequently but so far so good
great productso now i have used this product for  months on a microphone to line amplifyer and they last about  days on average
the batteries take  to  hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous
luckly i only use one at a time so i have time to charge the other onei would still say great producti ordered the product for the purpose of having to use them in our wireless handset mic system for the church they work great
we were going through about  v batteries every week but with this it holds enough charge for the wireless system for   hour services each battery
it has taken the cost of batteries from  a week to nothing and it can be charged overnight
no problems at al with them in fact we ordered  of them for backups along with  aa rechargables that we use for our cd players and recordering devices and they al work wondersi like energizer rechargeable batteries
ive used several beforethis one is on a sprinkler timer and so far so goodi teach  onehour classes a week which require a volt battery for the mic
i got tired of buying these every week or two so i bought the rechargable
the single charge lasts the entire week
i recharge it on the weekends and im ready to gono problems so far
ive had it for  months or sothe energizer battery charger seems to be a great buy for the money
i have been using it for many years without any problems
the nimh batteries seem to last long and a good charger does help
i bought  extra chargers so i could charge  at one time
another great feature is that this battery charger could charge all types of batteries
you dont need different chargers for different batteries
i have shopped around ther internet and when amazon has it in stock in their store buy it
they have the best pricei would buy  and get the free super saving shipping at the same time
happy charging
peace anthonyi have used this charger for a while and it works really well
it charges both nimh and nicd batteries in all sizes aaaaacd  volt
a full charge takes about six hours
you can charge different sizes at the same time
i consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to allit appears that there are several battery rechargers available that may be better for specific needs
for example one may want a faster recharger for use with a camera or one that does aa batteries only or one that work with nickelmetal batteries only
for more specialized uses there are instruments that are both higher and lower in pricethat said i agree that this is a versatile reasonably priced recharger
as you can see above it works on size aa aaa c d and v batteries
ive used the recharger safely now for over a year please read all safety instructions usually by plugging it in at night
as noted elsewhere you need to charge one or two pairs of batteries at a time with the exception of v batteries
here are a few specs for people with some electrical knowledge unlike myself i just read these off the backinput  acv hz woutput x vmax vmanote  as stated clearly on front and back use only for rechargeable nickelmetal hydride or nickelcadmium batteries not both at the same time however
also these batteries are generally more expensive than nonrechargeable alkaline batteries but for people who have a lot of toys and tools with different battery needs this may be the one to geti use the cable at home on my home desktop pc
its great for synchronizing my palm iiixe with my home and work pc
i use avantgocom at home to add news to my palm which i cant do at workbest of all it is cheaper then the cradle and it does the exact same thing
the only thing missing is the button that you get on the cradle
instead you launch hotsync from your palmuseful versatile lightweight and convenientthis small lightweight cable is easy to travel with
use it to sync your laptop or connect to any  other serial devicei bought it to use as a second hot sync cable to  help keep by home computer and work computer synced
the full sized cradle  is more expensive and less versatileyou can use it to turn your palm  into a terminal via a modem or direct connection
note you may need a  null modem adapter for some devicesfor programmers i think this cable  is fabulous
it makes the palm useful as a programming interface for any  serial devicethe low cost of a palm and cable means any small serial  interface device like a voicemail system can have a permanent or  temporary display hooked up without adding a lot of expensive hardware or  hauling around a heavy laptopi think this concept will increase the  need for palm programmers and generate a new breed of palm based  application interfaces with associated softwarebuy it if you need a  method to sync to a laptop when travelling or for an interface for a  serial deviceif youre going to sync from more than one computer this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle
to offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle you get better portability a lower cost and can hook it up to palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcrothough the palm iiixe comes standard with a hotsync cradle that isnt something you want to carry in your pocket
this cable is the ideal solution if you travel or if you need to sync with more than one pc
the generous  cable length is perfect  better a long cable than one thats too shortkeep in mind that this is not a usb sync cable its a practical serial device for the palm iii amp vii along with some of the older modelsread the other reviews here and youll find other creative uses for this cable so i wont repeat them here
youll also see that most of the owners who needed a serial sync cable agree  get this and you wont be sorryi received this dvd player yesterday  and my son tried to install it
he is not a genius at electronics
we called the toshiba service  support line and were patiently assisted with the installation
this was  extremely helpful to us
this is easy to install but if you arent an  electronic wiz this is a very good asset
the dvd player itself seems  flawless to us at this point
i would recommend it highlyi cant find a compelling reason to recommend a higher priced model than this one
sound and picture as rich as can be
it is worth hooking up to a stereo system if you have one near your televisionremote features are  excellent allowing for more tricks than youll use
chose this after too  many negative reviews of low price sony models im sure everything is  fixed but i wasnt going to take a chance over the holidays
wasnt a  toshiba fan before this purchase simple sony prejudice but now im  willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large tvs
youll enjoy  this player and its pricei own this dvd player
i just bought it in late march   it is the first dvd player ive ever owned
the sound and picture are great with my dads home theater
i am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom
i just bought a inch toshiba tv for my bedroomfor those of you who have problems getting rid of the zoom in the lower right hand corner hit the setup button twice that should get rid of the zoomenjoyupdate i still have this dvd player and it works greatthis is an awesome dvd player
i bought it after doing a lot of research online and truly understanding how the machine works
it came down to this onewhyzoom function you can actually zoom in and look at minute detail on the movie and pan left and right on it
it also allows for outside angles  meaning you can pan left or right while a movie is playing to see outside details from the center screen if the directordvd makers allow it which im sure will be the next push in the technology
speeds the selection of scan through speeds is amazing  all with startling clarity
resolution i scoffed that a dvd could produce that much better resolution and clarity of sound but whoa man
this is amazing  i truly am blown away with what kind of quality you get off this dvd player
compatibilityease of function this dvd player is so incredibly easy to use you basically just plug it in and play a moviefinally the dual tray for dvd play
this player comes with two trays to put in two movies  which youll find with longer epics out there
its simple to switch between on disc to the other and it makes it awfully convenient for viewing pleasurethey should really bring this product back
its the best out therethis is a great dvd player
i like the dual disc operation of this player
you can put two disc in the player and just sit back and enjoy
it has every possible connection that you need
the sound is great the  picture is great
i do wish that there was more controls on the front of  the player like a menu button you must use the remote for all of the  players functions other than play stop pause and forward and reverse
this play also reads hdcds but not cdrs which are rewriteable disc
you  can switch between the two disc and the player continues to play non stop
i like the feature of changing the black level of the picture which makes  the colors just pop
this a great machine and a must haveif youre like me you use two or more pcs over the course of a normal workday and you use your palmvx religiously
your palm already came with one cradle but you really need an extra to ensure all your pcs are in syncwhat more can be saidits the same high quality and easy to use charging cradle that came with your palm
mostly a convenience thing for casual users but for those who use their palms alot you need an extra
pick one up now while theyre still availablewhat can i say
palm products have always been of the best quality and the palm v hotsync cradle is no exception
i purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop so i can sync with several computers
the cradle bottom is metal and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it
a must buy for palm vx users that need to sync with another computer or need one at the office and at home
whatever the case maybe its very handy to have an extra cradle arounddidnt work for my device but it lit up and worked
i sent it back with no problem and a full refundthis is very useful addition for palm for people who travel internationally
unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world you may never use some of the plug adapters
i particularly like the hotsync cable
i can use it for syncing the palm with my notebookcomes in a neat pouch tooi travel quite often and lugging around the weighty hot synccharger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase
with the travel kit the charger and hot sync cable are seperate and much lighter without the stand like the cradle
works just as good as the cradle too
i like the fact that the charger comes with  extra plugs which can be used for different countries
great travel kit at a reasonable pricelike the previous reviewer i also purchased the kodak nimh batteries and charger and have found it to be a muchneeded improvement to the standard package
too bad nikon doesnt include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras
my wish list  an automotible cigarettelighter adapter  so i can recharge batteries quoton the flyquot
overall a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the moneythis kit comes with everything you need to go rechargable with one of todays digital cameras
i use it for my nikon coolpix and have noticed that one full charge of the  ma batteries lasts  times as long as  the disposable alkaline batteries that came with the camera
full  recharging takes about  hours
the plug on the back of the charger folds  up into the unit so you can slip it into your pocket or bag with no problem  and be rechargable anywhereoverall slightly more expensive than other  units out there but worth it
be sure to get  ma nimh nickel metal  hydride batteries if youre going to buy extra batteries with it youll  find all kinds of uses for them pager penlight handheld games etcyou simply cant beat this dealgreat little tripoddoes the job perfectly as a lightweight backup tripodi do have another big heavy tripod for windy days but plan to carry this one on hiking trails and long distance tripsjust what i neededi am amazed with this tripod  its light and east to set up 
the bag is nice too
i cant believe its so good for such a low price i received this tripod for christmas and i am totally delighted with it
it comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry
in just a few days use it has made a difference on my low light level and nonflash photosyou cant beat the price for a full size tripod for your camera
great for taking pictures of low light settings night shots etc
since the tripod will keep the camera still and wont blur the shot
the only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself
still worth it for about win  detected device without problem
wrote to and read from multiple disks without an issue
great option for making a boot disk for older pc buildsresurrectionsgood drive seems to read floppies more reliably than an old internal drive that i was using to try to recover old data
used on windows  x with no drivers or installation needed just plugandplayi recently found a couple of floppy disks with documents on them that i thought had been lost for ever  the disks were  years old and in a fireproof lockbox
 and i had no computer with a floppy drive that could read them
i wanted something inexpensive but which would work to help me recover the old docs and this filled the billi plugged the disk drive into the usb port of my asus laptop running windows  and the computer immediately recognized it
i held my breath and put in the first floppy
i opened the floppy from my computer and there were all of my old documents  which i was actually able to open and convert to a modern formati only needed to use this drive once so i didnt want to spend much money but on the other hand i needed something that would work and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it
this was perfect for my needs
id actually used some sabrent products before so i hoped it would turn out to be a reliable drive and it didwork well right out of the box after computer searched for and downloaded drivers
only used once for single floppy with much needed data
durability unknown
price was rightfloppy drive was a great purchase
works on all my machines of varying  bit operating systems and motherboard configurations
highly recommend this to othersim impressed
i have windows  and was concerned about it working properly
but no problem it comes with a disc but of course you dont need it for windows  just plug it in and windows  finds and install the driver automatically and i was up and running in under a minute
this was certainly worth the price
i had so many  left over from the s
i had no idea any more what exactly was on them so i just could never trash them
and i am glad i didnt trash them
there was some great stuff on those things
laughs and memories
its amazing how things have changed of the past  years
buy it you wont be sorry
and an extra note it doesnt pull up stuff automatically
you have to go thru your exporer and find the drive and open it but if you have s you probably can handle that
cheers great producthad a client who brought me a  disk and told me he had to have the data off of it
never thought i would have to buy a floppy drive or even use one
crazy but this did exactly what i needed it for even in windows   i figured when i plugged this into an  machine windows would basically tell me what is this
 mb hahahahthis device worked perfectly just connect it to the motherboard usb headers and your done windows  picked it up and it reads my floppy disks with no problemsso you have your tax records on a floppy and you need to get that data
whip this bad boy out and you are good to goits great did exactly what i needed it to do
works with mac mini
did not have any problemsthis usb floppy drive was purchased to allow me to retrieve some files that were still on  floppy disks yes they were ancient
my old pc had a floppy drive in it but my new laptop did notthe drive plugged in and installed itself with no driver required
the diskettes were read quickly and easily and the data saved off to cdrom for storagei dont know if ill ever need this drive again but if i do itll be available and readymy main reason for buying this drive was to process a few boxes of floppies id guess  floppies and i am about halfway through
after unboxing i was able to attach it to my windows xp box and it picked it right up without any driver installation or administrative rights requiredusing winimage i was able to image aging floppies with bad spots and ignore them even if i couldnt find a way to do so automatically in order to retrieve data i wantedive only just started using it so i cant speak to its long term reliability but if this drive dies before i finish processing the remaining  floppies ill  modify my review accordinglyi had an internal drive stop working on a desktop and got this instead of finding a new internal drive
it works greatthe sabrent external usb  mb x floppy disk drive was exactly what i was looking for it works perfectly and saved me from destroying all my saved   floppy disksi have had this product for about three months now it works on several media types just as described
i would recommend it to anyone
this is used by me only occasionally so i do not know about someone using it all the timeworks great
after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drivei was thinking of getting a used one but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper very sturdy dropped couple of times but it still works very plug and play never gave me a chance to complain works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drivefabulous product at a great price
a very simple plug n play way to transfer all those pictures that are on floppy disksafter purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didnt work on windows  i got a refund and purchased this instead
it was twenty dollars with free shipping
as soon as i plugged it in it worked
i read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files i needed to my hard drive
i do recommend this however if you are using windows  ill give you a few pointers
first off there is no install disc simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device
it will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the usb floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive a  you will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in
it may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy its not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any meanshowever it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with youbottom line this works great you just need a little patiencethese little things can be lifesavers
in modern times a floppy drive is nearly a dinosaur and the majority of new computers dont waste space on them
thats sensible as theyre seldom needed
however there remain those old sacred files long ago squirreled away on floppies and their loss can upon occasion be a catastrophe of sorts
these little drives are totally up to date with usb connectibility and cost next to nothing
ive been grateful to have carried one a sony in my briefcase for many years
this one was purchased for an associate who needed to transfer files from an older commercial graphics machine to alternate locationseasy to install just plug it in and you have instant floppy
i have a few old photo disks that i wanted to copy the files off of and no computer with a floppy disk
very inexpensive but well constructed and works greateasy hook updoes what it is suppposed to dothe price is nice tooa lot of us old timers still got stuff on floppyseasy hook up  just plug and play
now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive i thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them
i have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them until i got this drive
i like it so well that i will probably order another onecleaning out my office after an almost  decade career i ran across dozens of old mb floppies
recalling that i had used several for photos in one of the original panasonic digital cameras i decided i had better take a look before i tossed them in the recycle bin
unfortunately my current computers both at work and at home no longer have floppy disk readers so the sabrent external usb reader was an easy solution
glad i did because i found several photos i had forgotten i had
i have other sabrent products  usb sd and micro sd card reader and a usb external sound card
all three work as intendedi never thought i would need to look at a floppy drive again but lo and behold a customer had some very important data stored on some very old floppies
this saved his data and his price cant be beat
not a bad addition to have for your toolkit for that rainy daythe delivery was prompt the item was packed well and the floppy disk drive was plug and play as advertised
i simply plugged into my computer using the windows  program and the drive self loaded the software which took approximately  minute
it was ready to use
i was able to transfer my pictures from the floppy disks to cds enabling me to view my old pictures which i hadnt seen for a long while
i would at this point recommend the sabrent external floppy disk drive as i am very satisfied with the productarrived on time in good shape and works without hassle on windows  we need  for our business machines and this fits the billit works fine
just plug it into a usb port and it will allow me to access old floppy disksi still have some floppies that i need to look at occasionally
this device makes that possible
it seems to work with any pci used this external floppy disk drive to recover some photos and documents that i had from back in the dos and windows  days
it read my disks just fine and i was able to transfer everything to my new systemthesabrent external usb  mb x floppy disk drive fludrv blackis a totally plug and play device which operates perfectly under microsoft windows  x and x and also gives the user a straightforward way to boot up modern pcs from diskettes provided that the unit is connected directly to the motherboard with no intermediate hubs ie
the drive must be connected to the usb ports on the back of the pc in order to be bootablenote  when using the drive under microsoft windows  sometimes a prompt will come up saying that the diskette is not formatted and asking the user to format it
if you know the disk might have useful data on it cancel the prompt and open up the windows explorer windows keye to let windows reread the disk contents and voilagrave the disk contents will be presented promptly in the explorer window
i am pretty sure this behavior is due to windows  not the drive since using it under xp didnt exhibit the symptom and certainly booting the pc from the same diskettes which ive already done wouldnt be possible if the drive couldnt read the diski bought this to use for work and works great ive had no problems and i like that its plug and playeveryone in a while i get a customer that needswants to read old floppy disksthis drive is great for the money and installs in windows  and  without driversgood driveplugged it in popped in a disk and in a couple seconds the disk appeared on the desktop
shockingly mac os still has actual icons for a floppy disk built inhighly recommended if you need to dump some old files off floppiesthe only minor downside is it makes a humwhine while idle with a disk in it
i guess thats the price you pay for x the rpmworks as expected and is nice considering that even if you have an old floppy newer motherboards dont have the connector anymoreno problems with the drive delivered as promised good price
this really has saved me as i have some old   diskettes that have photos on them and no working machines with a drive to read themi was talking with a friend last week about computers and the conversation got onto floppy disk drives and how no one uses them any more
however and old timer like me has many files still on floppy discs both  inch and a few   inch
that got me to thinking about what i could do about them
i have an old fddmulticard reader that the card reader works with windows  bit but the fdd wont
so i searched amazon and came across the sabrent
i read the customer ratingsas i always do and saw that many people said it worked with their windows  and even windows  so i ordered it received it plugged it in and within a few seconds windows  bit said it was ready for use
i popped in a fd and heard the old familiar whirring noise
i doubleclicked on computer and there it was
i doubleclicked on it and heard the drive reading the disk and saw my files displayhow weird the young ones would have probably thought if theyd seen my face when it workednow i dont have to worry about the hundreds of floppy discs that i have not been able to read for the last few yearsi havent tried it with the lowdensity discs as i dont think i have any
i learned long ago to just buy the  mb discs as they were more costeffectivenow to copy the discs to my computer and then back them up to cddvdexternal hddnote nothing on the package mine came in says its compatible with any particular version of windows
it only shows windows pc compatible mac os x compatible usb  compatible and hot swappablenow about the  inch discsif you have old  floppies laying around but dont want to toss them before checking the content this drive is absolutely perfect
just plug it into any usb slot and windows explorer will see the drive without any drivers and it even works from the from the front usb slots
ive tried it on a winxp system and on a windows  bit system and it works perfectly on both to read and write to the floppiesthe price is great as well
i have some old internal floppy drives still but motherboards no longer come with the connection for them unless you want to install a rd party card to connect it all of which would be much pricier than the cost of this drivethis review is for the sabrent usb  mb x floppy disk drive fludrv black
its a well built quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired usb  cable for connection to the computer
theres really not much to say except that it works  simple setup plug and wait for drivers to load and install  then use the drive
how hard is thatworks well and allowed me to transfer all old data off floppy
now i can get rid of old computer  it is indeed plug and playi just plugged it into the usb on my lenovo laptop windows 
i was able to view every file on numerous floppy disks
  great price
if you have some old old floppies around i recommend getting this little beauty
you might have some wonderful old filesmemories you had forgotten about on those floppiesthis is a well made floppy drive that has no apparent issues that could have crossed paths with me or the application i put it inwork greatjust hooked it up and it works great
weve got the reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we wont miss anything
so far so goodi love the digital music channels provided through my cable tv service and i wanted to be able to listen to this music outside
i just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing cdsespecially when i had great music playing inside the housethe speaker has exceeded my expectations
if you read the directions carefully and follow them stepbystep youll have good sound outdoors too
i was up and running with tunes oustide within ten minutes
i needed another five minutes to fine tune which was easily accomplished by reading the instructions and the troubleshooting guide
if you refuse to read instructions or to show a little patience you get what you deserve
contrary to what you may have read in other reviews if the unit is set up correctly the sound is not thin
the bass is substantial and even with the volume set to maximum there is no distortion
i set up the speaker loud
and strolled my entire yard perimeter as well as the far side of my neighbors yard and could hear everything perfectly
i used the cordless phone right next to the unitno problem
the distance from my stereo to the backyard is the entire depth of the houseabout  feetwith signal passing through several plaster and brick walls
i found that its important to place the transmitter up as high as you can
that solved the few little sound problems i had at setup
what can i say
it sounds great and i love iti was pleasantly surprised at how easy this unit was to set up
within  minutes i had the unit set up and playing on my back patio
no static or distortion on cd or radio once i quottunedquot in the box
unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble
make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weatherworks fine for my purpose a wireless speaker i can move wherever i want to listen to my main stereo
i use it in the kitchen and by the pool which are not wired for my stereo
sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good rangeif you are looking for the best camcorder in the market stop looking this little toy has it all
the quality of the picture and sound are so great the you will feel and see every thing that you filmed as if you where there  live again
if you have a home theatre system with adobe digital  you  will really see what i mean
the only down side is you will need a battery  that lasts longer and make sure you get more tapethis must have been the best handycam for the price when i bought it
and i love the death out of it
all i can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured  years later
if you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition by all means get it
its a great camerathis very small compact radio plays very well for its size
i am able to pick up some really distant am stations and i am also able to pick up many shortwave stations only using the small built in telescoping antenna that it has
performance is not as good as my larger sw and ham radios that i own but all in all i rate it very good for it size and performance
this model is no longer being produced but you may be able to locate a used one that is in descent conditiona great little radio
i used it on my flight from az to nh
the fm and am came in just great
not sure about the shortwave as i wasnt able to pick up anything
but then again i didnt really try
i like the small size
fits in my jacket pocket
a smart looking radio
price is reasonablecon the ear plugs are useless
will not stay in the earits a very good radio for emergencies and grundid is an excellent name
i also believe it was on sale
it works fine and i recommend it highlyabsolutely fantastic my recorder stopped formatting my dvdram disks
i had used the recorder approximately  yr after using maxells dvd cleaner disk all is back to normal
great product even a simpleton can use it follow on screen instructions and you are home freei purchase maxell products because they works
needed to clean the old dvd player
put the disc in and followed instructions
simple as thati was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs
i bought this lens cleaner and  voila
 the recorder is working again
super easy to use its simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do
highly recommendedworks greatfor what im using it for it works good
i liked the excellent pricei would tell friends about this producti was in desperate need of a dvd lens cleaner
this is great
i was expecting something with more dust fibers attached
the wispy few fibers manufactured with the disc perform admirablyfor anyone who wants to have total control over what youre dvd movies look and sound like this is the unit for you
although the picture and sound are stunning
if you feel the need to make them even better the   gives you virtualy unlimited control
and it will save the settings for  two hundred discs
just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are  recalled
but beware if you are moving to dvd after years with a vhs that  flashed  opt for a simpler player
otherwise you will be paying for  a something that you cant control
the sony  will deliver fantastic  picture and sound for  less
and as far as the sync problems that  many have reported i have had the player for two weeks now and have had no  problems what so ever
even after checking out many of the reported  problem scenes listed in other reviews
dvd is the future of home video
dont take my word just look around yourself
if youre ready to buy  dont wait
you wont regret it for a minutethe sony dvds is a great buy for first and second time dvd player buyers alike
it offers a tremendous combination of features and performance at a very reasonable price
i had a year and a half old panasonic dvd player that decided to stop working and i realize now that it  really did me a favor
seeing and hearing movies on this sony has really  opened my eyes and ears to all that dvds can offer
i mention ears because  as amazing as the video quality is the sound quality is what really blows  me away and you dont need a humongous sound system to appreciate it
you  will not be disappointed by this product
it provides very near the quality  level of the sony reference dvds at half the price and features  inc a jog dial remote that put it over the sony dvds at least in my  booki asked around to some friends before buying a dvd and was recommended the d multiple times
the higher end models only give you changer control multiple dvdscds but since i already have a cd changer i  didnt need to pay for that functionality
i have never had any issues with  audio track and video track being out of sync in fact it has worked  perfectly
the remote control is intuitive with multiple rewind and ff  speeds
the slow motion also has multiple speeds so you can go frame by  frame with the jog function or the system can move forward very very  slowly front or back
full features digital menus most of the controls  can also be done from the console of th machine itself
i play cds in it  all the time as well
optical jacks and svid and coax really offer  flexibility when connecting to your stereo system
i especially like the  built in dts decoding and dolby digital outputs
very nice systemsimple to use compact one rechargable aa battery lasts more than  hours great quality
great value
i enjoy it everydaythe rio  holds a decent amount of music and the battery lasts longer than i expected
but best of all it is mac compatible and the tranfer speed via usb is fast
if you use soundjam on your mac the interface is right through that applicationthe rio is a great mp player  in this reviewers opinion the best on the market currently
its size smaller than a pack of cigarettes and weight about an oz
recommend it to shirtpocket musicophiles and  especially athletes
you can jog all day with nary a skip and with the  included netting beltclip it will definitely not pull your jogging shorts  down weighing about the same as a pager
interface with any usb  macintosh is seamless and the included software casady amp greenes  soundjam mp is the finest mac application in decades
all you need to  know is how to work the plug and how to drag and drop and youll be  organizing your rio playlists with no trouble
if it isnt already  soundjam will become your mp player of choice toothe rio takes  smartmedia cards and can reportedly handle any size including the upcoming   mb cards mine works perfectly with a  mb sandisk smartmedia card
 mb is just about perfect for listening to a full minute cd  recording say of beethovens fifth at  kbps sound quality
i also  get great sound out of a phonestocassette adapter which i use to  playback mps in my car
my only complaint is that the included earbeads  are terrible both acoustically and for the fact that they just wont stay  in
alternative headphones can be used but drain the power source  aa  battery rather quickly
a solution might be nimh high capacity  rechargablesi think that this is one of the most used toys i own
great for taking in  my car to have a fresh sound every week
great for taking for a jog or  working out in the gym no skipping
i only wish they included a ac  adapter plug
plays music smooth and loud great mp playervery well made unit
great sound
connects via usb cable to pc
battery life is soso
good support from manufacturer
you can get firmware updates easily at their website
comes with a quotcardquot not a manual
but there is a good manual and a printable version at the rio website
provided headphones stink
you can get a nice leather case from the sonicblue website store
mb stores a lot of music
i added mb card which are coming down nicely in price
i have two rios one for music and one for my audio books
decent headphone volume
display with latest firmware is sometimes hard to read
if you pull the usb plug during download or if download is interrupted the rio will lock up good
but sonicblue tech support website does have program you can download for free that will fix it usually
this happened to me and the program worked fineright now i think it is good buy
the other rio mp players use expensive memory quotbackpacksquot or rechargable batteries rio
i prefer alkalines
regular rechargable aa batteries are not recommended for the i think its a great unit
 stars easilyi have used this model for  months and it has plenty of audio and video including svideo inputs
it can record and play svhs and vhs tapes  with the former providing superior playback using the hours recording  mode and an svhs tape
it auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote
the best svhs machine in this price rangei got this jvc video tape player a long time ago and guess i paid about  for it back then
its the only vcr we have now that still works and dont eat up vhs tapes
i got it because of the svideo and i can play are old vhs tapes with svideo to a dvd recorder svideo input to save are old vhs tapes to dvd
with the way are other vcrs are not working and messing up vhs tapes it is very good to get them saved to dvd and this is about the best way using svideoraymond dayi have no complaints
i love the picture quality
the picture quality is even further raised with features like video stablizer video calibration and you can change the sharp tone to sharp for a sharp picture soft for a smooth picture and auto for use with video calibration
this vcr is the most reliable i have ever seen
sometimes the picture quality is better that dvd recorders
unlike dvd recorders there are certain tapes that can record hdtv
use that tape with its super video connection and you will have a knockoutwhen you hook up your antenna to the vcr then from the vcr to the tv you get a super clear picture
for antenna users it also has vcr plus so you can connect it to your cable box and it will automatically record for you a svideo connection hifi and an mts decoderesta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos una buena idea de la marca
me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado muchothis camera definitely works for what i need it for  taking pictures to use on my web site the schumin web and saving the remainder as stock photos
the floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer and thus gets high marks for portability
all in all a great camera and if youre like me whenever you take it with you carry some floppies in your pocket because you will be taking a lot of picturesthis camera takes okay pictures and its very easy to use
dont be repulsed by other reviewers who doesnt know how to use the camera just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself
it is in some ways  overpriced due to the zoom and floppy drive a x zoom optical with a  x is better than a x zoomx optical and x digital with x
i dont like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media because there are  different essentiel accessories that arent included in those pricesthe  compact flash cards could make you say quotaaaarrrrrggghhhh
i dont have  enough because i spent every penny on the cameraquotat the end  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures but it  comes cheaper than other cameras
if you have a lot of money to invest  dont buy this one just buy the best camera with the best lens and dont  look at lower priced items because quality is what you wantlast thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  picturescongratulations to those who bought mavicasmenot being a computer or camera quotproquot i needed something easy to use
i looked at the reviews for the product here at amazon
i decided to buy the f model
this model allows for a  second quotmoviequot
boy  do i like it
i like the ease of the floppy disk
the quality is fine for  my needs
the battery lasts a long time
a camera bag is a necessity since  the lcd screen marks easily
i recommend the camera to anyone wanting a  digital camera that is easy to use
thanks amazon for providing the  reviews and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews
i  found them very helpfuli paid  for this camera and its great
the one i got looked like it was hardly used at all
it was out of the box but came with all accessories the memory card the case to protect it lens cap all user manualsi got this camera to try to learn how to do infrared photography
i have to say its an amazing camera
i wish i had this camera when it was released in 
i pretty much turned the camera on and it worked amazingly
i used the adapter i bought on amazon to fix a m filter on and i have actually obtained amazing pictures
i am really enjoying infrared photography so far and i am moving onto ultraviolet photography next
i am doing this all for fun and my own enjoyment
i didnt want to mod my nikon dso this is the next best thing
for about  bucks i have this camera the adapter and the infrared filter
i have to say if you are looking to do some interesting things with your photography and are not willing to mod your high end camera this is a great nd option
affordable also this camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer
it is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera
i have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother the quality was so poor
this camera is the best i have seen and i would highly recommend iti just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since
the macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment
i do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but i figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it
i have not been  disappointed yet by the quality
picked up  rechargeable batteries and a   mb card and i havent looked back sincei just received this camera about a week ago
since then ivereplaced the mb memory card with a mb card
this camera definitelytakes some getting used to
im taking mostly photos of my new twinsand find that im either afflicted with the palsy or the camera is super sensitive to shaking
suggest trying a tripod that is my next investmenti think you also need to experiment with things like shutter speed to get the maximum picture out of the camera
i have had very mixed results with closeups but blame myself for not having gotten the hang of this yetoverall it is a really nice unit solidly built
youll need a bigger memory card probably a usb card reader and nimh batterys dont let them sell you nicads  get the mah nimh along with a  hour rapid chargeryou wont be sorry with the camerathis is good labeling tapeive been using thebrother pt labelerfor a while and use the blackonwhite labels as visual aids on electricaldata cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containersyou dont really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environmentsselect with confidence for your ptpt labeleri bought this to help label the kids school supplies
it works great with my ptouch
i will continue to purchase in the futurelove this and the price of it was good as well
would definitely buy this for my labeler again
awesomethe labeler that this fits is easy to use has a nice selection of style of label and the print is terrific
there is a good amount of tape in each dispenser i think its a must have for anyone that has quite a few things to label
the labels stick and stay wellthese were great
easy to use easy to replace would definitely buy againthese were shipped very quickly and arrived right on timegreat oem cartidge for the p touch
makes me file cabinet look professional and the cost is very reasonable
highly recommend thisit works perfectly
what can i say other than that
the inexpensive brother pt personal labeler navy bluegreen that this goes with is awesome so i pay the price for the refills gladlyperfect for your ptouch label maker
high quality labels with a decent mount of ribbon length for the price
the only hard thing is getting the sticker off of the ribbon paper would recommend the easy break off ones down the middle if you are willing to pay extra
overall though a great product for the pricei have used this product for twelve years i still get impressed how long this tape lasts and the ink never smudgesi have  p touch label machines and find the machines and the labels work great
i use them at work and for home usethis label cartridge is great
it prints white labels with black ink
i was out of stock and couldnt find them at cvs walgreens or even officemax
so i bought a few of them in bulk at amazonworks  prompt delivery  not issues  oem brother cart  works just fine in my label maker  not sure with whats up with amazons posting filters  their trying to tell me my original review couldnt be posted 
 its a great product 
 like what gives what can i say its the perfect refill and gets the job done
this comes highly recommended for your brother ptouch labeleri have an old model ptouch but it works excellent
ive had it for many years and have never had a problem with it
glad to still be able to find tape cartridgesi have a pt and works great  the tape i received is a genuine brother productproducts like these keep you on top of your gtd implementationworks great
make sure you have the correct size  there are at least  different size tapes m  tz and they are not interchangeablelove this and the silver refills  i see alot of reorders in the futureive had my ptouch labeler for years now and i feel like im always labeling something files leftovers kids stuff
but i only just now needed a new cartridge
so dont hold back label everything
these labels are high quality
they stick until unless you remove them then they come up without leaving any residue
you can even restick them
and because they are thermally activated the ink wont smear if it gets wet
i couldnt be more satisfied except the backing is so hard to get offthe product came in the factory sealed packaging
i have owned the brother ptouch pt for many years now and i love it
i am so much more organized
but this is about the tape
i use this tape on everything  file folders plastic containers metal cardboard everything except i dont think ive ever put it on wood
the most difficult thing is peeling the label from the backing
some days its easy some days not so much
the key is to gently rub the pad of your thumb over the edge of a corner of the tape
usually this separates the tape from the backing enough to peel it off
the tape sticks very well  ive even washed over the labels several times before it started to peel up on the corners  but it also peels off easily except from paper
it always seems a little expensive to me but one cartridge lasts foreveri use these labels and the associated basemodel brother label machine to tag plastic shoe boxes used to sort electronic and mechanical components
they stick perfectly and stay for a long time several years now and counting without peeling up at the corners
the print is high contrast and retains its color
all told a great quality labelfits in the machine perfectly  just drop it in the space and it automatically starts right up and you can continue whatever it was that you were working on  no muss no fussthis is the refill for my touch labeler and while it may be slightly tricky to replace you really have to line it up properly it is ideal and functions just as expected for a refillthis is the origional just like what came with the machine and it works the same too
youll like itthis is just what youd expect  a perfect fit replacement for a label maker
text comes out sharp and it doesnt jamm tape for brother ptouch
not much to say other than it loaded right into our ptouch home  hobby model pt labeler
prints fineit just works its really troubleproof
i have no concerns about it and i would recommend it to a friendthis tape is easy to install and easy to use
it comes off whatever you are adhering it to very nicely and without leaving a residue
i would recommend this product to anyone who needs to organize their lifethis spool of replacement tape shipped quickly fit our brother ptouch perfectly and was priced at less than half of what the office store was selling for
the ink prints black on a white tape face
these economical replacements allow for labeling with reckless abandoni have used this brother m tape before and it works fine
it is easy to load and work withi love my brother ptouch and this is the normal refill for it
it works just as well as the last one and even holds up in the fridge and the freezeri have bought this before
i get at least  years of label printing
i print things for my son at school and lots moreit fits and works well its the original brother m tape 
no problems works just fine youll like itive used these labels to do my filing
its a lot neater and easier to read my files
its the way to goi like having two labelers  the larger brother ptouch which takes tz tape cartridges and the smaller brother ptouch which takes m tapes
ive found the lowest price for both tapes is on amazoncom
i keep a red on white tape in one and a black on white tape in the otherwe have an old brother p touch that has been working for years
the only difference between these and the ones you buy at a local retailer is the price  much lower at amazon
we always make purchases that give us the free shipping to add to the savingsarrived in a timely manner i believe it is oem works as advertised
i would definitely recommend to any on looking to save money from the big box office storesexact factory replacement for my labeler
amazon prime does a great job of saving me time and money as well as gas and wear and tear on my vehicle not to mention the frustration of dealing with traffic and not finding what in need at the stores was exactly what i needed for my label machine and at a fraction of the cost of what the local stores wanteddoes what its intended to with no pain or suffering depending on the host unit i imagine
recommended highly for whoever needs this particular modeli ordered this tape for my father
hes had no complaints
its a quality product for half the retail costmy very old hand tape printer is a relic and tapes hard to find
when you do locate one the cost is more than the device thus i let this purchase slide for a time until i needed to label something importantworks great and this is exactly as describedi like this particular type of tape because black on white and high contrast width is perfect for file cabinet folders and handy for other stuff too i can cover up a previous label
clear labels you must peel off before putting a new one downi love my brother labeler
i label everything
every parts drawer and toolbox drawer
its somehow rewarding and creates a sense of calm to create order in ones lifeneeded more tape for the labeler we already had and the new one i just purchased
it always works well and we have never had any issues with themi use this for labeling boxes in my workshop
the labels stick and the printed stickers make things look a lot more organizedgreat for labels and its easy and works well all kinds of sizes and dimensions 
labels are nice very nicefound my like  year old label maker lying around one day
cleared out the batteries put new ones in was stoked that it even powered up
pressed print realized that there was no more tape
ordered this now its back to life
i should go label the cati have been using m cartridges for my ptouch for years to label anything and everything including all of those pesky cords and chargers that seem to multiply around the house
we kept ending up with boxes of cords and cables that no one quite knew what they went to and in many cases they went to devices that had been tossed long ago
by labeling cords when they come in the door i can better keep track of them and eventually dispose of them without fear of reprisal
the adhesive lasts indefinitely i havent had any come loose in the time i have been using the product and the cartridges dispense correctly every timeive used this tape for years and have an older brother labeler to prove it
using the tape on clean surfaces is a nobrainer but its not intended to be used on items that have high usage the printing will eventually wear off but a new one is easily made upive been using the brother label printers for many years now these are pretty good and of course you need tape for it to work im happy with this purchaseive been using this tape for my ptouch for years and its great
one cartridge lasts me forever
i can label anything including my childrens ice packs and cups
they stay on in the freezer and in the dishwasher
the ink doesnt smudge but after a few years of going through the dishwasher the ink may fade
if i need to i just peel off and make another one
as long as the surface is nonporous it comes off when i need it to without any trouble without leaving any residue
whats not to likethe price on these was excellent
i had shopped around and of course the office supply stores that had them wanted an arm and a leg for one refill
my wife and i love organizing with these little labelsyes i enjoy labeling things  looks neater for labeling kid gear than a sharpie does
of course i do love name bubbles for the serious kid gearclothes labeling tasks
i get frustrated when i am out of labels and having more color options available through amazon is a good thing
having more label tape is good as my kids find the label printer and start printing random stuffi got my ptouch like  years ago for  from another website
trying to find the labels is hard and at office depot or office max or staples they are expensivehere they are fair pricedof course i would have liked them for like  each but whateverits a brother brand tape that i purchased for my brother p  touch labeler
looks works and sticks just like the tape that came with my labeler
and available at less cost than i could find in the local office storesthis replacement tape was a perfect fit for my brother label machine
it was a lot less expensive then if i bought it in the storepurchasing in quantity is a great way to buy the mtape for brother labelers
i have been using a ptouch for years and love it
practically indestructible
the one i have at my office has to be over  years old
just bought a new ptouch for home and hope i get the same service from it
anyway the brother replacement tapes have always been reliable print well and they are durableexcellent product for about  as much as you would pay at your local office storebrother m inch black on white tape for ptouch labelerwe use this label maker quite a bit
the refills are first rate
i have not tried the other colors but the bw work greatexcellent allpurpose label maker  this tape works great in it not much else to say except it does the job  the labels workand i would also say that the sticky part has the perfect amount of tackiness
id be such a slob without my labelmakeri couldnt find this cheaper elsewhere and the printing on these labels dont seem to fade nor the stickiness seem to wear off
i only wish they made these with more label and less empty space in the cartridge so i dont have to refill my printer so ofteni love my ptouch labeler and use it all the timethis is a much better price than local on the label refills so i buy them hererecommendedthe brother m inch black on white tape for ptouch labeler is a very good purchase
i have been using brother products for years but i especially like this purchase because i can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and ups can locate the tenant for deliveries
it is a great purchase and i highly recommend itit works as expected
i installed this black on white tape on a brother ptouch model pt
the pt labeler is not available anymore so i was happy to see that the tape is still available
i am very happythe ptouch labeler makes its easy to label anything
the quality of the labels are good and work in most situationsworks great for the brother personal labeler machine white pt
just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacementthis brother ptouch labeler is what i needed in a pinch for labeling frozen foods
small lightweight and battery operated with a clear concise operation interfaceive been using the ptouch pt for over a year and just ran out of tape
the product works great for labeling files wires or anything elsei noticed some reviewers said the tape was hard to peel
the pt has a tape peeler feature just a little slot that gets the peel started and works like a champi use the tape all the time  it works perfect
looks good  stays perfect
i use it to lable files spice jars movie titles on the plastic cases
book cases etcthis is an excellent product
i use my label maker for many different applications
this label maker tape still lasts me for several monthsi have had no problems with this brand
the price was right and the shipping was fast
i highly recommend prime with the  day shipping
i had mine the next day after orderingi bought two of these with my brother label maker
i have no complaint they work as described and overall good price
the writing quality is as expected and they lasts pretty long time for me
ft is a lot of labelsso far i have not had problems with any of these cartridges  i have not found a generic alternative to the companys expensive products but when i do i will change
these things are just too expensive for what they arethe real thing in a brother package for half the price of store boughtand free shippingfor those that dont know this is crackback tape
just fold it lengthwise to split the backing and pull it off
no more worrying the edge to get the backing loose
i work with small letters labels so this really helpsi love my brother label maker and use it in our rental homes
this replacement tape is original brother though i have used knock offs and they work perfectly tooi purchased this tape as it is manufactured by brother
i prefer to use replacements designed by the manufacturer of the product
this tape worked perfectlyi use this  tape on all types of surfaces it sticks well and is easy to readthere are nickledime items that are necessary but only on occasion in life
it is good to have a product and a reliable source when that occasion arisesi use my ptouch for church name tags labels in the file cabinet shop labels cable labels and more
this is a great product and i always keep a spare on handi use this tape most often in the kitchen to label and date spice jars and pantry items
the labels adhere well to glass and stainless steel and do not peel off or yellow with time
ive also used the labels for a home filing system and after many years the labels still look crisp and brightthese labeling tapes fits my brother label maker perfectly
also i found that amazon had the best price for these labelsi use this for my brother pt and it works great
no complaints here
if need a refill i will buy it herethis is a good product  fresh just like in the store only cheaper
i have never had a problem with any cartridges ive bought from amazonjust like ive purchased in office supply stores for years but a great price
ive been using the tape for several days and works perfectly
recommend to anyonejust what we were trying to find and couldnt locally
and the price was so much better than we ever paid beforethis labeling tape is perfect for manila folders or really anything you need to label
it is waterproof and does not come off easily
i use it labeling everything from manila folders to binders to toyswe use this tape for labeling hanging file folders in our home office for labeling our tool chest to label jars of herbs spices and other food items we buy in bulk etc
i even use this tape to label bottles of homemade vanilla extract for our use and to give friends as gifts
this is a versatile labeling tape for many uses
the split tape is now easier to remove from the backing but as another reviewer stated due to static cling the bits are sometimes difficult to throw away
still a five star product thoughupdate nov   after we fell in love with theepson labelworks lw label maker ccbwhere the tapes were more reasonably pricedepson labelworks standard tape cartridge black on white  inch  feet lcwbncompetition is good now brother has the better pricing for tapes
so lesson learned is keep an eye on both or perhaps the answer is to buy one of each unit so you can always get the least expensive tapes
and had a better selection such as theepson labelworks metallic lc tape cartridge inch black on gold lckbmand the high visibilityepson labelworks fluorescent lc tape cartridge inch black on yellow lcybfweve been hooked on our epson and its tapesgreat product
very good text
backing is very easy to remove and stick labels on to stuffthis tape is so nice
sticks on everything
i also really love my brother ptouch label maker
good price too at the store this item alone was 
thanks amazoni have a large collection of historic family photos which needed proper identification
i tried one of the photos pens from amazon but it leaked through the paper and ruined a photo
this is not only permanent but looks professional
the cost is secondary here to the functionality
ps  by adjusting the margin setting printing on the middle font size and using the return key to create a two line label you can save valuable tape
using the memory function you can avoid typing common entries too many timesagreed the tape is expensive but it is a class acti have used several brother label makers all of which use the tz series tapes
of those tapes my two favorite are black on white in this width and the  width
i prefer the  width for hanging file folders because the label fits nicely on the tab
i like the  width tz for use with manila folders because the narrower width positions closer to the edge of the tabthere is also a  tape that is black on clear
however the clear tapes also show any dirt or debris that might be trapped behind the tape
thus if you are in an environment that has even a small amount of dirt or other contamination it may be readily visible against a light background after the tape is positionedone other caution regarding these tapes the backing can be difficult to remove
the newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing
even so a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backingupdate  since the time i originally wrote this review brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces making the backing easier to remove
however the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricitythis tape adheres readily the print is nicely defined and has a high contrast
the tape can be slightly difficult to handle
overall this tape is very useful in a variety of applications and one of my two favorite label maker tapesexact replacement of my original tape works great for what i use it for
i recommend using this replacement tapethe dealer had the lowest price th of the local office supply store
love these labels and use it for lots more than just labeling files theres a quote on my desk to remind me to breathe and focus
a tiny strip of plastic changing a life in a tiny wayhave my baseballs in plexicases with a clear brother label on each with name and info
this stuff is geniuswhat a deal
i received  cartridges of labeling tape with free shipping for less than the retail cost of  at a bm store
free shipping takes a bit longer but that was a choice i was willing to accept
product was exactly as what i would expect to receive at a retail store
i am delighted to get more for my dollar without having to sacrifice on quality
thanks
will do business againand againand againgreat for labeling clothing by size and season eg size  winter and toy bins dolls puppets cars etc
and freezer bags
havent had a label come off yet ive been use the label make for about a year
split backing makes taking the back off soo much easier
as for wasting the lead tape i try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the endsaves a littlei am so glad i switched to the brother label system specifically the ptpc ptouch label maker for the mac
these cartridges are just a fantastic
not a single jam since we left dynmothe quality of the product was good i only wish i could order more than one but that is all that was allowedits only  wide but you get great black letters on a sparkling white background
that slit down the reareasy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive
what cooler sound than the whirr of a brother  as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot ready to take on the world
file folders basement shelves neighborhood cats organizes them all with finesse
you wont find a better tz label tape than tz
stick it with pridethese and their corresponding brother label printer are a great thing to have
from the occasional labeler to the compulsive labeler and organizer this is great to havemy wife likes to label spices and foodstuffs i like to label electrical plugs and av equimpment wiresvery nice to havethis tape when used in the brothers label maker is superb
the letters are easy to read
unlike other labels ive used the backing is easy to peal off
i even labelled the breakers in my electrical panel
im glad they have a qwerty keyboard and not an az dial makes typing labels a breeze
i recommend typing labels in batches with a few spaces between each then print the entire batch and cut apart with sissors that minimizes wasted tapewell its tape what more is there to say
the tz is black type on white background quot in size
this is perfect for labeling dvd cases or optical discsit was good to find these labeling tapes at amazonat a good price
they can be expensive in office supply stores
tape was in the original packaging and works fine
these brother labeling machines come in handy for lots of labeling projects and this one is nice because it prints on clear tapebased on price and availability i bought this product
although never using one previously i felt that this was the right choice for me
it appears well made and easy to use
finish is good and does what it suppposed to
that was what i wanted
i would recommend to othersvery good tape  just like i have bought in the store for a higher price
same good quality  cheaper price through amazonbrother tz tapes are the most reliable and durable label tapes weve used
generic ones just dont cut itinch is our most used sizeclear is great when you want to use it on colored foldersthis tape is great
very crisp text and very easy to peel off backing and past on to thingsi love my brother labelmaker and this tape is great
good value for the amount of tape
im label happy and it takes me ages to use upthe prices for brothers labeling tape on amazon have gone down significantly from when they where first available on amazon
now that they are much more competitively priced i wouldnt get them anywhere else but here on amazon crack and peel tapebrothers crack and peel tape makes it very easy to remove the backing from the label to expose the adhesive surface
the backing for the label is splitprecut along its entire length of the tapelook ma no fingerprintsyou can easily crack and peel the top or bottom half or the tape grab hold of the other half that has the backing still on it to position the tape in the desired location paste and smooth out the half with the exposed adhesive surface and finally remove the backing on the other half of the label and smooth out this half of the labelwith this method of applying your label you can avoid leaving any fingerprints on the adhesive side of your label tape for indoors and outdoorsbrothers labeling tape is designed to withstand weathering so they are suitable for use indoors or outdoorsbrother labeling tapes are durable and affordable
the crack and peel feature alone makes it worthwhile to switch to the brother labeling systemas described by seller
clear tape that when used in the ptouch printer has black letters on the clear background
works best on white or light colored surfacesthis works well in our ptouch machine
we use several different sizes and try to be conservative because of the price but we have not had any problem with the tape getting old
we use it inside outside in the heat and in the cold and on utensils that go in the dishwasher and it sticks without failive been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it
i went to staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so i went home and ordered on amazon
i should have done that the first timethis is a nice tape with limited application
if you want to label a light colored smooth surface with minimum change to the apperance of the item this is the tape to use
it would however be very difficult to read the black print on a dark surfacei used this to label my black glasses and items  works as expected and fits what it says it fitsthis oem tape is just as expected and pricing was better than anything local
we have had nothing but great results with this tape and our brother labelerglibness aside ive actually enjoyed this
its great for doing small network jobs and keeping cables organized
the cartridge is a bit pricey but worth it
sticks and stays stuck till you want it unstuck
pretty good arrangementthis tape is greatits  stars greati have  colors of mk tape for my pt  mk black on white mk black on yellow mk red on whiteall  kinds are really good productsand im glad i have all threeits incredibly easy  quick to switch cartridges in the machinejust pull one out  stick the other one inno threading tape through slots or rollers or anything like thatno loose ends of tape dangling out anywhereno wasted tape whatsoeverits really a very good simple designthis review is about the black on yellow inch tapebut i must comment here that the pt machine is really a nice little unit in every respectthis mk black on yellow label tape is very easy to readlabel separates off the backing very easily tootape sticks well but you can still remove it to reposition itim  happy with itcant quite decide whether i like the blackwhite or the blackyellow the bestboth are very easy to use very easy to readboth very nice itemsno doubt about itc smithmarylandi love my label maker
i have a home office as well as a shop filled with supplies for our events
there is something tacky about sharpies and duct tape
i have  different color labels this one being the green and so our  different setups each get a color
then on each label i can put my company info incase it is lost of misplacedthe label material it self is a heat transfer label
meaning if it gets hot it will become black
the green is more of a mint green which is not an issue unless you are trying to make it match something
overall the resulting label is very resilient to fading in the sun being pealed off of most surfaces some plastics like rubbermaid they do not stick to and the size is very readable in both large and small fonts which my brother ptouch printsnow the down sides which can be big for some people
i am  and for a guy i have nails which i need to get the backing off
there is no split down the center like a crack and peal so you have to try at the corner for a bit
once  you do a few you get a method down but it is still a pain if you need to label a ton of things
my label maker has an auto cutter so if i have to make  of the same label i turn it off print all  on one strip peal the backing off of the whole thing then cut off the labels one by one with scissors  the second issue is chemicals
i have tried to use them in the garage but brake cleaner degreaser and some oils will rub the ink right off
it is weird because it is a heat ink so it must be a layer on top of the label which i am wiping off but either way i had a flashlight and i tried to clean the oil off of it one day and the label became blank
the sticker it self was awesome and stayed in place with no problemover all a great little label product  of the applications it works perfectly and the adhesive becomes quite strong over time so they dont fall off in  weeks
if you are labeling automotive stuff or rubbermaid bins you will need another productmy brother ptouch labeller is several years old now and its getting harder and harder to find the m series tapes in stores
i love my labeler as it works well even in subzero temperatures important for me so its great that i can find them on amazon for an extremely reasonable price especially with free shipping with primethis is the color and refills i will always reorder it makes the disc look so professional when you mark a disc with it
love itthis color combo is one of my favorites the other being black on metallic blue
ive used this type of tape printer for years and love itthere is nothing especially important to say about this cartridge
they do their job flawlesslyi use it in my brother model ptbrother pt personal handheld labeler with special time  date functionit works well lasts long and provides quality labelsand the price is much better on amazonhope this helps youi hadnt realized that brother made a tape cartridge that features black on gold
it looks great for christmas labeling
it also works for halloweeni bought this silver tape when my original cartridge of white tape ran out
as others have mentioned here its really a gray more than silver
the standard white tape provides labels with a little more visibility and contrast but this silver is better when you dont want the label to stand out quite so much  i used it to label some components in my av setup and like the more understated look
the black lettering is still very legible and the labels end up looking a tad more elegant on the gray
if high visibility is priority one go with white tape
if you want more subtlety pick the silverif you want to label something so that it stands out from the rest this is it
these do fit the machine very wellthis cartridge is by far the best for all your printing needs
the inner tape is thick and clearly sticks to any paper material when the peel off seal is removed
brother has a nice line of cartridges in various colors so enjoy their productsworks great and sticks ok i use alittle glue on some stuff just to keep the corners from flipping upive been using this method of labeling for quite some time now and i find that its alot neater than wriringthis severs its purpose if you are like me then these things are just for youif you are looking for a simpletouse inexepensive labling machine this is the answer
the price is right and it is very versatilebest value anywhere online
suits my needs perfectly
quality product and excellent price
hard to beat that combination anywhere else online or retaili ordered different widths and colors to mark videotapes for processing
some videotapes will be processed at a commercial facility some i will process myself
this was i can use color codes to identify which is whichi use this to label my jellies and perserves for giftgiving
i use it to label all my homemade homebaked goods at christmas time
excellent waterresistant and easily dresses up a boring jar with the metallic gold tapeworks great on my label makerworks as advertised
i try to be organized  having a labler that is quick  easy to use helpslabel things
label all the things
i like having the colors to coordinate with whatever is being labeled  battery packs food canisters pets and small children
so buy this assuming you have a compatible brother label printer and embark on a rainbow of happinessi love the transparency of this tape and it sticks to a jar or cabinet really well
fun to useim replacing a cartridge for my label maker and this is the right color and size with a reasonable pricei thought non  laminated mean dull surface
it is pretty high gloss
silver has slight pearl color shift to it
very nicebought this to go with my old about  years brother pt ptouch labeler
this one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface
used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools
fits and works perfectly
nice to know i can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printerthis works perfectly in the brother pt
the color is eye catching and the labels stick very well
now i want to try the clearit is the real deal
what else can i say
well they want me to say more
black on clear is more discrete and less showy
but then again black on white is easier to readi like labeling things boxes so i know whats in them devices so i know what theyre specifically for warnings etc
the great thing about this item is that there is no white strip to show whats there
the clear background works very nicely against the objects own colors making the words look like part of the originali use my printer a lot and this tape brother m black on clear in x ft  was priced rightthis is the best cb range is  to  miles using a wilson wi willie external magnetic atenna 
cb is crystal clear transmitting and receiving
very well made and love the fact that it can be powered by the cigarette adapter included
i use this cb with my miata club and nobody has a problem keeping in touch with this cb
love the fact it has the weather channels and that you can lock in your settings
i highly recommend this cbi had a cheaper nonportable midland for a few years until it gave out
bought this one as a replacement for my car and it has been worth the extra money
it has a lot of nice features on it that you would find in higher end cbs for a lot more
but what i like best about it besides the features and portability is its size and easeofhandling
it fits nicely in the cup tray or cd stack in my car
and the knobs to adjust the squelch and volume are easy to feel and turn without looking at it so that i can keep my eyes on the road
it fits well in the hand and is easy to use
the sound comes in clear and others tell me that im coming through clear
the speaker isnt the loudest and pretty directional so youll have to move it and face it towards you when trying to hear sometimes
otherwise a great little cbmidland make a nice portable unit and it has some nice features for its price
this unit comes with  battery packs
one is for standard cells and one is for rechargeable cells
it also has a v adapter that takes place of the battery adapter and gives you the option to connect a larger antenna which is great if its taken form vehicle to walking
its built well and it works flawlessly
if your looking for a good combo unit as a backup or as a main unti this is a great little systemi bought this because of the duality of its nature
it can be used as a walkie talkie with either  regular aa batteries or  rechargeable batteries which can be charged while in the radio
or you can plug it into your vehicle power point and use it with  just about any kind of cb antenna you may choose
just make sure you check the swr or have someone do it for you if cant do it yourself
good sound quality both as a cb and as a weather radioand when i got it from the used department at amazon bad idea it was a couple of weeks before i was able to try the rechargeable base to see if it worked
everything else did but this item did not
having hassled with amazons chat function a couple times i wasnt in the mood to deal with them again so a quick email to midland got me a replacement rechargeable battery box that did work no charge no hassle  days in the mail and im very impressed with midlands customer service
thanks veronicaif youre in the market for a portable cb option  please do yourself a favor and seriously consider the midland what makes this portable cb option great is that it is a reliable source for inside your vehicle  and you can just as quickly switch out of it and start using it outside of your vehicle
which is great when you are traveling convoystyle on a jeep run or similar activity
does it work as well as permanently installed cb
maybe not  but this one has worked great for mei got this for camping in the boonies
i got the antenna to increase the range
it works well
good for weather reports in the areaexcellent value
works great easy to learnoperate
i have not used a cb radio in years so was impressed by the scan feature
 ways to power it and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector no need to buy adapter
control buttons located handily easy to navigate
can recommendi didnt want to mess up my dash or drill holes for mounts
this product fit the bill perfectly
the volume knob was cracked and i wasnt going to send it back for that so i purchased some mm knobs and trimmed the base ring off of them and they look even better than the originals
seebdfaythe best part about this unit is the battery packs one for normal aa and one for rechargeable nicad and a charger too
this allows you to go portable and mobile
the wiring set up for in the vehicle works great and allows you to put the handset between the driver seat and console and remove it if you dont want to leave it in the vehicle
the fact that i can use it out of the vehicle too is what made me buy this one vice the similar cobra product
so far it works great and ive gotten pretty good range mated up to a tuned firestik antennae
having weather bands as well is a plus
great for x folks in the fieldthe bad news is these things had their hay day in the s  i purchased the one above and im happy with itbutthere is literally nobody on them anymore
maybe some people near a major interstate but thats itgreat if your on an interstate all the time but other than that not so muchbut a really nice radiowhile i have hamcb equipment in my carscari really like to have in my most recent car nothing installed and permanent for now thanks for a great producti use it with my mobile unit to keep in contact with the others when we go in the mountains to go rock hounding use mobile for the base uniti have purchased two of these radios and they work great
when we go camping the wife uses one to communicate with me when we are backing up our fifth wheel camperif this radio was stolen in would instantly buy another onethis unit has the best of both worlds
the cb comes with  battery packs one of which is setup for rechargeable batteries
it also has the mobile adaptor which allows for the unit to be wired into the car for full power and antenna capability
the battery life is really good
i can go all day and have plenty of power to keep goingi have a firestick on the back of the jeep and this really helps out when surrounded by hills
the handheld is great if you want to step out of the vehicle and still be able to stay connected
swapping back and forth between the mobile adaptor and the battery pack takes all of  seconds
it is simple to swap back and forth multiple times a day
especially if someone in your off road group continually gets stuck  the additional weather band has been convenient to have on a few occasionsi have not had any issues whatsoever with range with the short antenna
the longest distance i have tested was about a  mile on an expressway but the reception was clear as day
i only use the cb when i am with a group and we typically stay within close proximity of each other
the firestick drastically changesincreases the range of courseso if you are like me and use your radio for recreational use and want it permanently mounted in your car then this is absolutely the perfect radio for you
buy a firestick with the quick disconnect and you can basically have the entire setup up and running in less than  minutesi use this with my lil will on my bmw is mainly to talk with truckers about speed traps on longer trips the unit has very good circuitry for how small it is and it leaves basically nothing to be desired except i wish there was an option to leave the screen backlighting ongreat little unitbefore a recent offroad group outing a cb was on my short list
after reading plenty of reviews i kept finding myself turning back to this
finally pulled the trigger and ordered one  even picking up a  savings on a repackaged one from amazons warehouse dealsive had such success with the aa battery base attached that i havent even been deeply tempted to permanently install the unit with a fixed antenna
heres my take on it after a half dozen tripspros  comes with everything needed to be functional short of batteries and a fixed mount antenna adequate range on alkaline battery power and stubby antenna more than adequate battery life
i did  daylong trips before i was tempted  not forced  to change batteries startling clarity
a fellow  wheeler asked me what unit i was using that he wanted to buy one for a backup  handheldcons  might be a minor point  or a technical nightmare  but itd be mad handy if the unit could be used with v power andthe whip antennain short  theres not much more to be added to the fine reviews and the strong performance of this unit
for value clarity power versatility and installation flexibility i cant see this unit getting beatupdaterelative to the con noted above i emailed midland support to ask about the v  whip antenna issue and to ask about a replacement volume knob
they very quickly and graciously responded that it is indeed possible to use the unit on v power with the included antenna
heres their clarificationwhen you slide the mobile adapter on the bottom of the radio it disconnects the rubber duck antenna on the top of the radio
to avoid that from happening you canplace a small piece of tape on the bottom of the radio over the small squared contact right next to the  screws on the bottom of the radio before you slide on the mobile adapter
a replacement knob was sent as welli tried out the unit with the  aa rechargeable base
worked great for the trip staying on a total of  hours in scan mode while i ran the batteries out
eneloop rechargeablesgreat design for use in any vehicle since it offers flexibility in mounting and connecting options and additionally allows for it to be used as a portable ie
walkietalkienice portable cb
full  watt power and weather channelshas a extra battery pack and i never thought id use the phrase batteries not includedyou can plug it into the car vdc socket and use it with an external antenna again not included
ez  mile range with a decent antenna
about  mile range with the little antenna that comes with itworth the pricethis cb is nice money well spent i will love using this unit it come with all you need to start with used it on motorcycle while on a  mile trip
bought the  headset broke off the headband and inserted the speaker in helmet
mic worked well until we hit ts andrea and it got too wet to understand
will be using in car toonice unit has weather band too
good range for small unit
use on bikes to chat to other ridersits a nice little unit to test out my motorcycle cb
it has all the right accesseries  performed as expected
not so good in high traffic areasthis radio is just greati purchased this product from amazon when midland first came out with this radioback in  or have not had a single issue with the radio
it works great has wonderful shortcut buttonsand in my own thought much better than the version that cobra hasonly downside is that the back light does not stay on
but from there on its greatthe radio works as advertised and i enjoy it very much
the main reason i ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an inauto cb
with the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck
it also is a good price
if you read the specs and know what you are ordering then you will not be sorrynice radio that does everything i need it to do
coupled with a jeep mounted ft firestik the range is better than expected
would highly recommend this cbthis cb radio is the most awesome cb ive ever owned
and iv owned a lot of them since the s
this is so easy to go from totally hand held to a  mobile cb and the sound quality is better than my big radio
just be sure you match it with your antenna when using it as mobile
as with all cb radios this is a must do
there are good swr meters on amazon or elsewhere if you preferlike just about any truck stop or radioshacki would definitely recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a new and very versatile cb radio
happy cbing
update if using in a big rig you may want to use an external speaker with it
i could still hear but found myself straining a bitit takes all of about  seconds to plug in a extspeaker and well worth iti also use a retractable mickeeper hooked to belt clipto quickly install in truckcb radios were very popular in the s
 in  cars had one
in the mid s there was some what of a come back that may have lasted for a couple of years
in  there really are not that many cb radios out there
this is the reason i think some of the reviewers think their radio doesnt work there is just nothing for them to pick up
this being said cb radio is still alive and used
truckers use them so you can always find out what the traffic is like or where a speed trap is and there are still people out there with base stations and mobile cbs providing for interesting conversation
just not as many as  yrs ago
having base stations mobiles and handhelds in the past i decided to reenter the cb world with this midland
it came nicely packaged with everything that is advertised
first i put batteries in it and listened in the house
heard truckers on  plus found that on  there is a whole group of locals that talk on their radios nightly
this was just using the included antenna
next i hooked it up to an old firestik iba indoor cb base antenna i had stored away and i was picking up enough transmissions for the radio to be entertaining
next day i drove around with the radio in my f with the stock antenna and batteries
nothing
not a single thing to be heard
last night i put a magnet mount midland  mobile cb antenna on top of my truck and used the unique cable accessory that came with the radio
you snap it on to the bottom of the radio where the battery pack goes and  you plug one connector into the cigarette lighter and the other to your antenna cable
the radio pack and this device slide off very easily and slide back on securely so you can attach it to the radio or take it off in a few seconds
i ran the cable from the antenna through the door
closing the door on it was just fine  with no damage to the cable
now for the big test
i drove  miles to work this morning during a major snow storm
the radio worked like a charm
i was picking up all the truckers a lot of them and getting reports of conditions around the whole area
the rechargable battery pack allows you to run the radio home off of your ac current or if you prefer use the regular battery pack for normal batteries or use the car device with your cigarette lighter
there are also jacks for a speaker and mike
so essentially you can use this radio as a base station  a mobile radio or as a handheld
small enough to just slip in your pocket
also the sound although not really loud is vey clear and  easy to understand
radio also picks up the weather bands
im very happy with it
i havent transmitted to anybody yet but i can tell transmit works well by testing it with an old handheld i had
distance would be measured by the type of antenna i use and how i tune it
once i make a few contacts ill get back here and let you know  how far i got
i buy radios for fun and in the week ive had this i have had a lot of fun with it and would recommend it if you want to have some fun with cb radioupdate yesterday i was in a higher area in my pick up using the midland  antenna talking to a base station  miles away
he said the radio sounded good
so after using it for a few weeks now im very satisfied and really glad i bought itbeing extra class ham i like radios that can go with me
this radio is a very nice addition
hardly ever talk on it but use it to listen to traffic reports in conjunction with a k antenna
i have received very good reports when i have transmitted with it
all of its features work very well as advertised
i have it mounted in my work truck using a shaped coat hanger
also i am using a radio shack mic i originally purchased and used for my icom and rs ham hts
this mic has a speakerout jack on the connector so i also have an extension speaker hooked up to it
has great volume this way with the convienance of a real mic
cant go wrong with this one
just get itworks great
i pretty only use it out on the trail when im wheelin
i installed a  antenna gets much better reception and range
i like it because i can take it out when im done so less chance of someone stealing it
also very easy to usecb radio is what every trucker needs and this one did me just fine
like it a lot
just dont understand why i need to write  characters about the productthis is a great little cb radio
its ability to be used in the cartruck with an external antenna easily hooked up and moved from car to car
or it can be used as a portable hand held unit
which is nice if youre a truck driver backing up and someone is guiding you in the dock you can hear them over your main cb in the caba lot of thought went into this unit
the weather channels the seperate battery packs
one for rechargeables and another for regular batteriesjust plug it in to rechargethe quality makes this a solid little uniti have owned this radio for five years and it is a great radio
if you are going to buy this to use in your car you will need to buy a habnc cb adaptor and a roof mount antenna or else it will not work inside your car
if you are going to use this for outside
you will need to buy a hand held radio bnc telescoping antenna for longer range use
the small antenna that this comes with has a very short range and you will not be happy with it
other than that
this is a great radio and has a full  watts output like any other cb radio
i have read some of the bad reviews on here and they are so wrong i had to put my two cents in on this radio
so
rememberits all about the antenna
thanksthis does exactly what it is suppossed to do
i can use it as a portable cb when i am out of the car or in the vehicle with an external cb antena while on the road
weather radio is a big plus as it comes in handy whether camping or in the house and expecting bad weather
good example  tornado season
keep the radio with me when going to the basement for weather updates and if worst case happens then still have comunication with the outside worldi have a small car without much room for a traditional under dash cb
i bought this to communicate from car to car on a road trip
it works quite well
car to car range is about  mile in heavy urban traffic about  miles on the open road as long as there is no hill between you and the other car
converts quickly to a handheld with the supplied battery pack and short rubber antenna
range is only about  to  mile in this configuration but could probably be improved with an extendable antenna
i especially appreciate that midland supplies different battery packs to take either rechargeable or disposable batteriesonly  minor gripe
the belt clip is spring steel and will scratch any belt you hang it on
i would prefer a plastic squeeze clip like that found on many cell phones or on industrial walkie talkiesother than that im very satisfiedthe first thing i noticed about this radio was how quiet it was
in the city there is almost always a ton of background chatter
with the squelch set just over the noise level only talk came through when there was talk that could be heard
i havent had time to put the radio on the road but im impressed so far
it is made to move from car to car and does so easily
a magnet mount antenna and a v power port and youre on the airincluded are a rubber ducky antenna alkaline battery pack and rechargeable battery pack to turn the radio into a walkytalky
the recharge pack is the one point im not sure of yet
a power pack can be plugged into the side rather than taking batteries out and putting them back in for charging
whats not clear is which battery type can be used nicd or nimh
convention would be nicd
i will do an update at a later time when i find out more
 markwe have a travel trailer and needed a cb radio which turned out to be hard to find anywhere other than online
with that said this is a great little tool and we are very happy with the purchase
i cant speak to how it compares with others since the last cb my husband and i had any contact with was back in the s so in that regard this little number is quite an improvementi really like this cb
it has the ability to transmit quite well with a dedicated whip
if you like this sort of thing like i do you will really enjoy its compact size and features
technology is a tripi was looking for a radio in case of emergency situations and this was the perfect solution
more people have cbs then any other type of radio because of the truck drivers so i know theres a better then average chance i could reach someone else in an emergency with this radio
i live fairly close to one of the busiest freeways in the us and can get a signal with this if i step outside of my house
i purchased a simple magnetic car antenna and love how easy it is to swap this from car power to handheld power so i know ill be ready either waythe sound isnt super loud but i can drive with the heater on full blast and the windows cracked on the freeway and hear it if its near my head
ive had no complaints about the sound quality and get fairly good reception so far  miles with the car mounted antenna for certainmost cbs require a calibrated antenna of a certain length for maximum range so im certain i could get farther range with a smal amount of effort this functions as well as my old truck mounted cb i had when professionally drivinggreat for camping we talked the whole way down with the car mounts then kept in touch in the park with the handheld packs
has a powersave option that keeps you going as long as your batteries can stand i had to buy  rechargeable aa batteries seperately for the charger pack  we did have a few issues when on the far side of the park from each other but getting to higher ground put us back in touch again this was a mapped distance of  miles from hilltop to hilltopive had otehr small scale cig lighter powered radios and this one has been better in every reguard
the unit doesnt overheat hasnt blown a fuse and functions just like youd expect a quality item to
standard mounts and plugs for everything but a talk mic
you can purchase a headset unit or else youll have to use this as if it were a standard cb mic but you can easily plug any headphone jack in for headphone or external speaker soundoverall this is a really functional solidly built hybrid design for the nonprofessional driver in need of a radio
id recommend anyone who doesnt wish to purchase and install a full blown cb in their personal vehicle buy one of these the more people around you with one the better off youll be in an emergency situationi needed a cb for when i go offroading
after a lot of research i bought this radio
in conjunction with a  firefly antenna and a few minutes with an swr meter i can send and receive as far as i need toi gave this as a gift that was wellreceived
i have been told that it works great and is appreciatedand ive owned my  for more than  yearsmy  is reliable compact and its wx weather capability is priceless
on one occasion i didnt know that a small rainstorm that i was driving in was actually the leadin
