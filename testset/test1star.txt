im a professional otr truck driver and i bought a tnd  at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier
rand mcnally are you listeningfirst thing i did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it
the software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so i could be sent a patch on an sd card
hello
i dont think im all that unusual my home address is a po box that a friend checks weekly and that i might get to check every six months or so
i live in my truck and at truck stops
if you need to make a patch available on an sd card then you should send the sd cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold
i ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the tnd  was completely updatedi programmed in the height  the length  and the weight  of my rig and told it that i preferred highways
i was parked at a truck stop in the cincinnati oh area
my next pickup was about  miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks
my cell phone gps sprint said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup
the tnd  routed me thru  miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup
very exciting especially since every time i refused to turn down a street posted no trucks the tnd  took almost  minutes to figure a reroute and it happened multiple times on that short tripi decided to give it another chance
after my pickup on the north side of cincinnati just off of i i needed to head to phoenix az via i
easy route is to just hop on i and drive west and south to the intersection of i
indeed that is what my cell phone advised
the tnd  however wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up i on the other side of the city
i turned it off and the next time i passed a truck stop of the same chain i purchased it at i returned it and got my money backi then spent  on a cheap printer
now i take a minute to set up my route on google and print it out
hasnt gotten me lost yet over several cross country tripsive had mine for a year and heres what we got
it tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me
this is such a bad problem that even interstate  in denver colorado is listed according to this gps as a non truck route and will route you through the city instead
there are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half of about  have crashed to an unrecoverable state
our company representative said that rand mcnally informed them that the gps was not designed to say on for a long period of time
really
its a truck driver gps
we have one driver with a  dollar ticket due to this gps routing him down the wrong road
the companies response was to update the unit
ive had mine for a year i never noticed one update that corrected functionality they only seem to keep messing the tools
i want a gps that routes if i wanted tools id buy software for my computermy suggestion is to by a nice garmen
my one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for truckswaynebought new but i could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished
plus the was missing the  arms but had some other random hardware included
i made mine work for my  set and it serves its purpose
just wish the seller was upfront on the condition i could have bought a used one for  lessi checked around amazon as well as some other sites and decided these were what i needed
i read the reviews looked at the pictures and bought two of these
i received them today
i unpacked one of them read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for amazon
these mounts are very very heavy and require  yes six screws to mount to the wall
are you kidding me
the tvs are only  lbs
two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary
what a joke
and lag bolts
ever heard of screws
the other issue is that these are very hard to move
i bought an articulating wall mount for a reason and i expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my handi consider myself to be a good diyer
ive installed mounts for my  samsung  and  led tvs with no problems for  years
so for this videsecu mount inspite of poor installation instructions i carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new  samsung led smarttv in a limited kitchen space
my mistake was based on the diagrams i assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount the single and the double arms were of the same length
what a disaster
after installing the mount when i mounted the tv and folded the arms the tv did not center itself to the wall side of the mount
it was then that i noticed the inner length of the  arms is about  longer than the outer single arm
in other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my tv was not centered in the limited space that i had and looked awful
i dont know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length
at least they shd have mentioned it in the instructionsthis to me is a major product defect
luckily with amazon i was able to return this mount but had to pay return shif less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality it might be a good productthe product was doubleboxed
the included level was broken
i would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts
one of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system
despite  huge lag screws and strong arms the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates
each time i moved it it had to be readjusted to be level
the hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling it made moving it very difficult
i used a  tvthe whole thing went back in the box for a refundi bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the tv based on our viewing angle
in order to move it i had to loosed the screws each and every time
i had it connected to a in vizio lcd which is pretty light
could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it
had to returnmounting a  inch lg tv weighing  poundsproless expensiveprevious purchase of videosecu productappeared solid and stronghad tilt and various adjustmentsmount on single studconsaggingthis is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the tv is pulled out from the walltherefore one cannot keep the tv properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other anglesmounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation armcritical bolt attachment for the mount from the tv to the articulation arm does not get tight
this is amazing
it is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use
this makes the product unsafei am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall
i need to get a different one
my prior experience was with a videosecu mwb tv wall articulating mount which is far superior for a larger tv
i bought this other one because i wanted a tight fit to the wallcan i send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it downhave no idea why people love this thing so much you cant load any applications unless they are from the barnes  noble store and you cant even download the free version of angry birdsapparently barnes  noble is worse than apple at remotely disabling nooks they deemed rooted by end users
you have less control of this thing than you would your tvthe root kits are useless for this os version  and the instructions to root  jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks it is an overpriced barnes  noble franchise in your dumb little hands and youre well served keeping your receipt and refunding itcheck your sn with barnes  nobles  number
mine was used from buyaccessories
i paid  too much as used is under  these daysif all you want is a tablet for reading bn books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game this is for you
otherwise passthis is listed as an android tablet but its not
its android on the surface but it cant access google play and instead uses the bn app store
this means paying for apps that are free elsewherealso my unit takes an incredibly slow  minutes to boot drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a s drug store computerwonder where the camera is
its at the factory  there isnt one
forget skype or face to face video chattingspend your  on a real tabletby the way not a slap at amazon just the tablet itselfthe customer support people at barnes  noble site are clueless
they are useless for providing help
if you buy tablet you are on your own
in the store it is the sameif you want an ereader get an ereader  the battery dies in a few hours or a couple depending on brightness settings
if you want a tablet get a tablet
there are far better options for a similar price
if all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps fine
but this thing is truly lacking
ive owned mine for  months and havent changed my mind about it yetupdate the product gets even worse with age
it will not fully charge ever and at  it goes crazy
it runs all sorts of apps closes them types things into the browser and wont let you use the tablet at all
this may not seem like a big deal but it is unacceptable
 should still be enough to read for a bit rather than going psycho and taking over the deviceupdate sepput on cm  android  last week
ive got to say its nice
fonts are small though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues google this
netflix works and the ui is really quite nice  pretty much no need for button savior battery life is same as cm
in general i like it better than cm
my major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes no bt no gps
seems to charge fine with a normal cableat this point i lean toward samsung tablets  i like the ir and the microsd slotupdate jul  ive installed cyanogen  which works with button savior
i had trouble installing from zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microsd card
fonts are sometimes a bit big as is line spacing but in general cm frees you of the bn walledness even as somewhat mitigated below
netflix doesnt work and google chrome wont run on android   headphone jack a bit intermittent  need to wiggle wire sometimesoriginal review dec first i give a summary followed by the details if u are interested
i hope people will read reviews here as if you say much at all on bns site they dont post your review and dont allow you to modify it so that u can post it
a nook tablet could be quite good if you only want to  read ebooks purchased from bn  browse the web on a tablet  play a small selection of games having to pay x normal androidapple pricesget something else or modify it if u want to  buy a full selection of gamesapps  pay the same price for a game as u would on an iphoneipad android phone buying from either the android marketplace or amazon app store  play music where u can sort by artist album genre etc  play mpeg videos  watch youtubeif u are willing to do a bit of work you can do all this by modifying the device
i used it rooted with the modifications described below for  months before installing cyanogen  on it
this is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications  its essentially a normal  android tablet nowthe detailsmy daughter got a nook tablet for christmas   shed been saving for an ipad  but at the rate she was saving we took pity after a year and a halfwhile she does read and so do us parents she also wanted to use it as a music player and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car on a plane etc and she wanted to play some gamesi did my reading and we seriously considered an ipad for the family with each of our  kids putting in  or soi read about the kindle fire and nook tablet  the fire only had gb of onboard storage at the time and no micro sd slot
a dealbreaker
this was pre samsung galaxytab nexus etc
since the nook tablet has gb and a micro sd slot we went to a store to take a look
sales guy was good and the device hardware shows well
once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup we found the first of our issuesissue  onboard memoryof the gb of storage you can only place your own items in gb
the rest is for bnpurchased content
gb is not enough for a music collection or any significant amount of video
a gb class  microsd card was also in her stocking having read about this ahead of timeonce she unwrapped it and we set it up easy enough annoyance  showed itselfissue  app prices and quantity examples angry birds and fruit ninja  bn market    amazons android market  adfree with free adsupported versions available  android market  for either plus free adsupported versions available  apple app store  and  plus free adsupported versions availableyoutube freepreinstalled on all androidapple phonestablets i know of not available on the nook tablet not in the nook storei didnt buy either game but instead looked back to some of my prechristmas reading  u can load amazons appstore without rooting the device esp
if its running v of the software
i got that working and bought  adfree fruit ninja and angry birds
while i was at it i sideloaded a few other apps by emailing them to myself and webbrowsing to get them and got usb drivers working on an xp laptop so i could sideload via adb over usbi wasnt home for christmas but i did have my work laptop which has music on it
i copied some over and began to use the music playerissue  builtin music player limitationsthe builtin music player in android is decent  has been since android   the first version i used
u can generally sort by artist album etc and the ui has dark backgrounds rather than white
the nook builtin music player doesnt allow sort
for this i didnt want to buy a music player so i went ahead and rooted the device and installed honeycombs android s music player which is free
also put the standard android youtube app on since i could now access the android market
the problem wasnt quite solved because changes to the sd card adding files werent recognized
i tried winamp songbird and android s music player when ics came out
they had the same issue
ttpod does work  you can manually refresh at any time
i now run cyanogen whose music player modified stock android to add gesture support works just fine
they were aware of tablets when they wrote itthis is ironic  bn had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen  cyanogen  android supports gestures for music  do an arrow to the left like lt say and itll go back a track
this would be great while driving
note that u can unroot by putting a copy of  on an sd card which though im not sure would probably allow you to return the device if u needed toissue  builtin video player limitationsid also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos i nabbed from our tivos from which i stripped the commercials saving them as mpg videos
these wouldnt play with the builtin playeri solved this with mx player free version which plays them fine
u can do this only if uve installed amazons app store or rooted and can access the android market
people out there are selling pc software to convert videos to a format nook tablet can use
no need  just get another video player
mx player tip brightness control is an updown swipe on the left hand side of the screen volume on the rightissue  ui inflexibilityu cant add shortcuts to the desktop and cant do much with the sliding applestyle bar either
for this i installed app manager tough to find a apk to sideload using adb so i needed rooting and then got it from android market
this is a fantastic app and i dont use my golauncher screen much any morealso theres one physical button
standard android buttons such as menu rightclick and back arent always around in the ui and holding home doesnt bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android
they should have put those standard  buttons on the device
update after a month rooted use button savior which gives soft buttons with a flyout
once in a while you have to use nt hidden settings to check usb debugging unless you use cyanogen
update post cyanogen cm can have soft buttons back menu home etc displayed all the time if desired and has button savior installed as wellissue  can only charge with their chargercablenothing more to say
blackberries and android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable
it charge very slowly even if it doesnt tell you it is when connected to a pc because or other charger
with some irony bn has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage
if they could charge with any microusb cable they wouldnt have to
update postcyanogen with cyanogen it charges with any microusb cable though slowly unless its the actual nook stuff  there must be something in hardwareissue  ota update breaks all the niceness ive achievedan ota update v will break the ability to mail yourself apks to be used to enable nonbn apps to install and to enable debugging
i imagine u could have done these steps while on  and gotten sideloading via pcadb to work but u cant disable ota updates
u can if you root though so i did then used sqlite to modify a setting to only update when done manually
itll never autoupdate
update postcyanogen irrelevant nowgoodness  hardware is pretty sweetsnappy installs apps fine opens them quickly videos are fairly smooth scrolling is pretty good but not as nice as applesscreen is great from angles clear and brightits lightweight and can be held easily in one handspeaker is pretty loud  louder than any of our phones except maybe blackberrygoodness  the reading aspectthe reading end of the device is wellimplemented though i give amazons original kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage  an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase ui
doing so from the web is also very fast
a web order using a computer of a bn sample appeared about an hour later but quite snappily when done from the devicegoodness  books with videossoundyes these are available on kindle fire and ipads
i know
i do like the talking kids books reminds me of a leapfrog tag pen but without the ability to touch words and hear them and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce
this is good for cooking
u can see what each stage is supposed to look likegoodness  good if u root it for when rooted its a nice tablet  it has the bn connection and it cost 
it isnt an ipad no cameras or bt and its half the price
update nov  there are now a multitude of  tablets asus samsung google which get my recommendationwhy pay to be restricted i simply didnt see the benefit with all of the other tablets out there having apps that perform exactly the same tasks
just decided to go a cheaper route and i am so glad i didmaybe i would consider the nook again if it is expanded beyond a ereaderhighly disappointed
i purchased the new bw touch version of the nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when i need to do it from the book
i didnt know that you couldnt download the etextbooks to my nook from the nookstudy part of barnes and nobles
why would you call this nookstudy if you cant download the textbooks to a nook readerseriouslyi could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device slow touch response flickering on the screen when changing pages keyboard mistypes characters etc but not being able to download a textbook from something that says nookstudy
smacks of misrepresentation somebody should sue
on the nookstudy web page it says that a nook is not required it should say not intended for nook devices
also it will not load onto any other handheld device that has the nook app only on a pc or a mac
they should rename it to desktop study using the nook label when you cant use it on a nook device is false advertising anybody want to sue
anyway im returning this and buying a kindle at least amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks ie
almost all their kindles mac pc and oh an ipad
if your planning on buying this for your college bound student get them a kindle insteadi bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books
my plan was test it out and buy  if it worked
i planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books
barnes and noble requires a credit card to activate this unit
that is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it
they could lose the unit etc
i loaded my credit card information to test the unit
after deciding to return the unit i talked to customer service about deleting my account information
the answer from  people was you can not delete your account information
i can not recommend this companyi bought a nook about  months ago
i wanted to consider a kindle but they were not available locally so i was very hesitant to buy one sightunseenbn had just released their wifionly version for  which was very reasonable
i bought one from bn with moderate research and minimal handson
i have regretted it ever sincetoday i said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle
i cant comment on it very much except it is lightyears faster than the nook and the interface actually works
i have about  books in my nook library most of which i paid for so im a little frustratedthings that are good about the nook it looks much better than a kindle
while it sits there unused on my nightstand
epub support
i live in alaska which means it will be another  years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so its not a big deal for me
free fridays
every friday nook owners can download a bnselected book for free
most are crappy fantasyromance books but i have discovered several very good authors that i wouldnt have otherwisethings that are bad about the nook awful awful awful touch input
i cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen
the screen itself is slow to respond it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait  seconds for it to actually do nothingthe touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate
you navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad
it will randomly jump to the top or the bottom
it will randomly ignore a touch there is visual feedback so its not a mistouch
it will randomly click twice on the succeeding menustrying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one is a test in patience i no longer have patience for
the keys provide visual feedback when pressed
this suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only  or  characters were actually used
you have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with youthe touchscreen is the main reason i ditched the nook
it is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable
browser
the bn rep sure talked that up
after spending  minutes trying to use the browser to register a bn account so i could actually read books i gave up and used my laptop
the browser takes about  seconds on average to display a page
it doesnt matter if its a real page the mobile version of facebook or just google search
it will also randomly crash every minute or two
and by crash i mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reasondo not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while youre sitting in bed reading a book
battery life sucks
sorry but it does
i like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a day battery life on it
i think it gets about  hours per charge minus the  when it automatically goes to sleep
there is a persistent charging bug with the nook or at least with mine if you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping as in just normally leaving wifi on when you plug it in to charge the wifi will activate internally as it i assume checks with bn for book updates
this stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cablethis is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi
the next morning you grab it only to see the cute your battery is too low to operate message
it weighs about  more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker
not a big deal but if youre in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means youre switching hands every so often
heavier does not always mean better
page turns
when i first got the nook it took between  seconds to turn a page
i would actually press the page turn button when i got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned
a software update has vastly improved the page turn speed about  seconds now but only when turning the actual book pages
library pages shopping and browsing shelves still take  seconds
i have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective bn support did not think so or it still sucks
this also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text
screen readability is acceptable
it looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer with pixilation apparent
the kindle is more crisp and darker
the included merrium webster dictionary is broken
a large number of entries simply do not work
if you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page
i do not remember which letters are affected but it does not appear to be priority for bn to fix
shelves
shelves are bns answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library
you can create a custom named shelf and place books on it
it is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend  seconds trying to find your new book and another  trying to put it on a shelf
sometimes it just wont let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook
this adds another  hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall
sometimes books fail to open
this means you have to go back to your library and open the book again
i have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention
once you get a book open and keep reading that book until youre finished it works well enough
but the menus navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent
its built on an android platform which means its buggy and randomly crashes or stops working
a restart usually solves this but i keep shouting why why why every time i have to
although i havent had to restart it since i got the kindle
this may or may not be a result of not using it any moreclosing thoughts i would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an elibrary only to find yourself in the same situation i found myself
if you really have your heart set on it buy from a local bn and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it
i waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems
after that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed i was outside of the return period and stuck with this nicelooking nightstand decorumnot happy with my nook
be forewarnedyou can pay for some books and they will download but you cant open them
how to avoid this
open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for nookand not nook color or nook etcjust nook
ive had to ask for credits several times alreadythere arent enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing
maybe the nook color is a better betive owned this original nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it
ive also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with nook support and other activities related to keeping it running
im an experienced software designedprogrammer engineer etc
and i can assure you that compared to a paper book this is a seriously flawed concept
if you insist on buying an ebook reader make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps  bns concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gearon top of those problems consider the very concept of the electronic book
while you will pay close to the same price youd pay for a real book on sale you wont own the book  youll have a license to use it
when youre finished with the book maybe youd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend but you can only do that if they have a nook and you can loan it for two weeks only
i suppose when the two weeks is up the borrower sees the book disappear finished or notand then theres the odd problem of your nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with bn when you registered your nook
i recently had to change my email address and updated my bn account with the new address and new bn password
after that i could no longer download books and was unable to unregister and register my nook that was supposed to fix the problem according to the support center
if you happen to get yourself into that dilemma be ready for a long drawnout session on the telephone
the problem was that bn neglected to spell this situation out on their website when i changed my email addressso if youre into going green driving a hybrid car and thinking its going to save you money in the long run then the nook may be for you
if all you want to do is read forget the nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading
give the price of the nook to a local charity
everyone will be happierthis is the nook i dont likeit doesnot habe light to let you read at night but have a colored screen to navigatethis is poorly conceptualized as ereadernot user friendly toobeware
i bought this used and the person or company i bought it from didnt have the common sense to deregister it from the previous owner
that should be done before you sell it
no excusein my honest opinion nook is unfinished productnone of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middlesize fonti am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadableformula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable
i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on finetuning the text rendering on ebook readerthis is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application
no matter how hard i try i just cant force myself to try and read a book on the little  by  screen
the display is small dim and has poor contrast so its hard to read unless its in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly
it wont play very many types of books besides pdf files and kindle books are not compatible
also it goes to sleep if you dont keep constantly moving your finger around on it
also its supposed to be able to browse the web but the web function doesnt do anything but show a picture of a web page that talks about its features but if that did work it would be useless since theres no mouse and no way to move around on the page
it can play mps that sound ok but its s of times bigger than an ipod and too large to carry aroundnot worth saving a few bucks
go with an ipadi bought this product used from a coworkers daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it
it is heavy and slippery
the capacitive touch is not perfect and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently
there is only one option for a page turn lefties beware
the battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book and the plugin is at the bottom of the unit
since the cable is specific to the nc i hated to risk bendingbreaking it as i can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a long time while it recharged
i traveled with this unit and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge
a lot of the ebooks i own are in pdb format which bn sells but the nc does not read
i was having problems with the unit not doing the motion sideturn and read thingy and bn pretty well ignored me
the local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help
the concept of the unit being less than  months old when it died and turned on twice before i bought it didnt bear any weight
a local computer repair guy charged me  for absolutely no help at all apparently the nc is far too complicated for anyone but a bn repair person which never bodes well
now the unit fully charged will not turn on at all again no help at the forum
since for  more one can buy a viewsonic gtablet with  multitouch lcd screen android os  and download reading apps for it id say forget the nook colorive had the nook ereader for less than  months
its been ailing for at least  of those months
at first it wouldnt start up for no apparent reason
id get crazy messages and images on the screen but no access to function
i went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions
they did
lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions
the things i had to try were a nuisance but they worked when i was persistent
i learned to fuss around and get the thing started
then the charger started failing
id have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the nook
that worked for awhile
after awhile it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so i bought a nookcompatible charger from amazon
good news
it worked
bad news
it worked for only a week
i called nook customer service
they said i really needed a barnes  noble brand charger
so i laid out another  or so
that charger worked for about  daysnow the eeg for my nook has flatlined
no web advice and no customer service advice helps
however in my last conversation with bn they told me to take it into a bn bookstore and have them look at the device
this will be my last ditch effort
if further measures require an investment of more than  cents ill tell them to pitch it in recyclei wouldnt have hung in nearly as long if it hadnt been for a nook game im addicted to and can get nowhere else
time for onlinegamerehab i guess
i will never buy another nook
as my kids would say its a p of sbarbara coxi have had the opportunity to test both nook color and kindle fire
my favorite is the kindle fire
poor customer service from barnes and noble  the cable breaks easily and this device is not compatible for swaps what i mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable nook color you can not do that once your nook color is out of warranty they will no longer replace the cable so if it breaks your like sol until you buy another one for   shipping  tax the cable is really cheap and breaks to easily i think each time ive had a new cable replaced i could only get it to last about  uses before it broke it keeps breaking at the n
the updates are horrible basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you dont update actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you cant keep charge
it takes forever to turn on you have to wait like  minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another  minutes to boot up with kindle it turns on almost instantly after a while you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up but it still loads quicker than the nook color
a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side with kindle fire you have to dig around to find them they are in the settings like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings
another feature i like is the card expansion slot
i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them and you cant do that with the kindle fire
check each stores content before you buy
each ereader loads different files this is the main reason i bought both
most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble but i prefer to read on the kindle
after im done with school im going to be selling my nook color but i refuse to get rid of my kindle fire unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side and plossibly a card expansion slot
for me i actually found out that most of the content i liked was available through amazon for free and it cost at bn so that may be another influence for when you decide to purchase its just i wish that amazon would just carry all the textbooks i need so i dont have to keep going to bnso other than the software is a tiny bit easier to navigate around id prefer kindle fire over nook any day just because i get longer lasting supplies and better customer serviceyesterday i spent over an hour playing with a real nookcolor at my local bn where ive befriended the staff as i go there almost every day as an unemployed
anyway i was very dissapointed at this iteration of the nookfirst off the nookcolor is very heavy
i think its almost  pound and since its not a true tablet youre supposed to hold it in one hand but itll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes
even the bn guy told me to hold it with two hands
thats pretty pathetic i must say
the only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support which obviously is not convenient for a device thats primarily an ebook readersecond even though its much faster than st and ndgeneration nooks it is still slow especially when browsing the web
now page turns are generally faster but there is no animation and sometimes there is a slight delay so youre never sure if the device registered your turn gesture
very annoyingthird the screen is highres but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles
i think the resolution is x and the dpi is in the high s but overall i felt the screen looked coarse
i guess for this price they have to pick some cheapo screen so no surprise there
the color lcd screen of course draws down battery pretty quick a fact even the bn staff acknowledges readily
also the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlightspeaking of the screen the digitizer is not very responsive whether you want to zoom in or out or type something
its slightly better than my thgen ipod touch but thats still a very frustrating experiencefourth the software is still buggy
the demo unit in store had a few books but half of them could not open with some mysterious error message
the web browser could not render several web sites i triedfifth the interface is very confusing
there is the hard nook button there is some kind of drawer button on the screen
after an hour i still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something
very dumbsixth of course you cannot access the android marketplace app store at least without jailbreaking this
very few apps are available and there is no indication bn will allow more aps since they wnat to use this sell ebooks which carry fat margins and have superenriched amazon and its founderin short this is a disappointing device not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an ebook readerthe list price is  and bn does offer a day money back guarantee if you buy it from themit constantly acts up
i try to use it for my textbooks but when i try to turn the page it glitches and zooms in
the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself also doesnt allow returns
would not recommendi got this for my wife as a christmas present because we have a bunch of books in epub format
i put them on a microsd card went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books
i have over  hours invested today trying to get support help
phone goes to some third world place and i cannot understand the people
chat  times is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault
basically useless supportreturning it tomorrowi gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate
my daughter says she loves it  it helps her improve on her reading skillsi have a amazon kindle ereader and few hundred books and was wondering ifthe nook works on the same book format mobi as the kindle
i emailed a friend last night and he wrote back this morning  saying his nook was dead in the water it can happen with any of them  what was funny was he said he wrote a review on the nook  and said that he purchased a color nook and have enjoyed it for many years
then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak english well  so he asked to speak to another
next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person
when talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair
the nook rep  had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to north korea and hung up the phone
he said he  sent a number of emails and they didnt  respond or when they did they say read the manual
so john the nook is great until you need service but to answer your question i cant open mine  to see the format so you may have to go by a barnes and nobel and ask them
you may need to hurry as barnes and nobel books stores may be closing the doors soon
most everyone is switiching over to the ereadersi think that all international customers should be forewarned that barnes and noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers physically residing in the united states
this is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the united states even by barnes  noble themselves as this is the same card that i used to pay for my bn membership and despite even giving them my us postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real personthe thing that angers me the most is that i explained to barnes  noble via phone that i live in trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books but after purchasing a nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors a leather case and a  gig sandisk memory card all bought on amazon i have not been able to purchase a single bookif international customers are not welcome there should at least be some type of warning on their website
i feel like i was rippedoff by barnes  noble and the sad thing about it is that i bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife
shame on barnes  noble that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale my money was good enough for them but i am not good enough for their product
now i have this new nook color with all of these extras just gathering dustit is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollarthe real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the barnes  noble website for the purpose of purchasing books they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as i am concerned they have lost this customer permanentlyps
this review has nothing whatsoever to do with amazoncom my gripe is with barnes  noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about international customers
update  update  updatein the interest of fairness to barnes  noble and giving you amazoncom community  reliable information i decided to open an account with a bank thats based in the usa to see if bn would be able to access the funds from that account im trying to find out whether its a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for surei decided to try this little experiment because i just cant understand how i can gain access to sample books from bn but every time i try to purchase one there seems to be a problem what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the email that was sent by bn after i tried to purchase a book via my scotia master card books can only be sold to customers physically residing in the united statesi now have a bank of america visa debit card which i have not tried as yet it is possible that the issue with barnes  noble is that they cannot access funds from my scotia master card which is based in trinidad so i will give the bank of america card a try seeing that its based in the usa and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my pay pal account
ill post an update as to whether it worked or not
update  update  updateim sorry for taking so long but anyway let us get on with it
as i said before every time i tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the email that was sent by bn after i tried to purchase a book via my scotia master card books can only be sold to customers physically residing in the united stateswell i found out that it is possible to purchase books on the nook once you are using a us based card
i was not able to purchase books using my scotia master card but i had no problem whatsoever when using my bank of america visa card so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location or ip address
the only issue that i see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a us bank card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via paypali have noticed that there are some us based sellers that have problems accessing funds from trinidad based credit cards some even have problems accessing funds from us based cards although they are also in the us themselves in cases like this ive found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via paypal
ive never had any issue when paying via paypal even when other forms of payment could not worki hope that this helps a littlebought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books
the pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly
power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening
im returning these today and getting a kindle
oh yeah and it locks up totally every so often and again you have to power it down very disappointed
barnes and noble support is terriblevery disappointed with this device touch screen is quirky buggy and unpredictable
 no way to get back to where you were if your finger happens to slip very bad
 doesnt display side loaded drm epub covers correctly
 freezes up fairly often especially browser
 when hooking up to a computer files often get corrupted device freezes after you restart home screen gets messed up etc power down button misbehavesive had to unregister and start from scratch  times already because of these issues
 bn hardline pop oriented marketing sucks
 bn bookstore misrepresents mislabels books  show one cover get a different book
you can end up paying for a gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover
 dictionary is limited in its vocabulary and you cant access the dictionary by itself nor does it link to other words or referencesthis is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet
im sorry i bought it
ive never used a kindle nor will i ever but besides the kindles if you want a good reader get a sony t
if you want a tablet buy a real tableti purchased a nookcolor a couple of months after it came out
within a week i had to return it because it would not charge
a lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me
once i got it set up i used it about  times and it locked up on the home page
it took  days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement
i received my rd one and it lasted exactly  hours
screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold
this time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement
the th one is sitting unopened in a box in front of me
well after having trouble with three of them i no longer feel i can trust this device to work consistently unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency
and would like to get a complete refund
so far bn the site i bought it from wont do that for memorals of the story stick with a kindle  i bought an early version of it and still love it
and if you want color go wtih the kindle fire
only buy products though amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns
they werent selling the nookcolor when i purchased mine
its now about a year later and im still trying to get my money back
my plan is to take this unopened box all receipts and emails to a nearby bn store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refundwish me lucki got this as a gift about  months ago
it does a few things well like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights
after that it is all downhill
battery life is about that of a really long life laptop
at the store they told me not to expect anything better than  hours
and if you are not connected to wifi like i was not at a cabin for  weeks you cant even set the time there is no function to do that
i mean really  and if you want to archive a book you cant because that is only an online function
any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop
in bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade
if you are not connected to wifi and your book expires then the little book icon gives you a message that says the content is no longer available
what that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi after which it miraculously fixes itselfall in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house but for traveling its not worth lugging around
really why even use it around the house when i have a fast laptop already that does a lot more
this thing is just not ready for prime time paper books beat it hands down
get a good led book reader light and keep your i asked at the store if i could return it and they said only within the first  weeks with a receipt so buyer bewarebig timeheres my take on nst  this is a very nice but very limited reader
i love the display
thats it
a real home run
not quitequick summary is that they wont sell me any other unit with an lcd i spend all day looking at one of those i dont want another one for my funreading
i might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet and that wont be from bnhere are the problems with the whole nook thing
 you cant use it for a pdf magazine or anything with graphics because you cannot zoom or rotate
i have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you cant see
guess they want you to get the color tabletlike nook huh
nope not going there see above
 you cannot share books
yeah yeah they say you can but thats very limited and makes no sense
if the publishers trust them enough with their drm to have the book at all why cant you transfer the book to someone else using the same drm
i can get a paperback read it and share it forever
not so with nook and you know it
 bn and everybodys ebooks cost the same as a new paperback even though the seller didnt incur any cost of printing shipping inventory etc
but i can get a paperback for  off at my local kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers or i can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at  or more off list
when everybody in my family has read that book i can sell it to the used book store for  or  of list value
thats a winwinso wheres the advantage with a nook other than its cool
three strikes it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book
this whole ereader thing is bravosierra at this pointthats my 
just wish i had known this before i spent the hundred dollarsi enjoyed the original nook
i thought this would be a great device especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sitesive had the nook  of them actually and am returning it before my  day window is upfirst the buttons are annoying to use
i like having the option to tap the screen but id rather keep it as clean and clear as possible
simply hard to press the buttons down
they dont seem to be getting any easier after finishing a booksecond and most importantly is the contrast and quality of the screen
different letters are darker than others on every page within words and they change every time i go to the next page and back
i thought it might have just been something weird with the files or formatting so i played around and did the troubleshooting
nope
its just horrible to look atafter having  with the same problem im going to just send it back
no need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service
its too bad i really wanted to support barnes and noble by using their readernote i put this review on the bn site and they removed it for somehow violating their terms
well okay thenunboxed the nook
charged it up
wont connect to my wifi network when three laptops in my house will
and it wont work at all until you register it
posts on the internet say its a complex technical issue
im calling the bn tech people
if they cant fix it fast then this thing is going back
i didnt sign up for hours of struggling with nooks technical problems
i have better things to doupdate customer service didnt help
took it to barnes  nooble store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldnt look at it
i figured if the battery cant hold a charge for that long than i didnt want the device
the seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and i had to pay for shipping
this thing cost me time and money a bad experience all  around
ill never buy a b  n product again certainly not from a third party seller
ive ordered a sony reader directly from sony
hopefully ill have better luckwe bought one of these for my motherinlaw hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use
it has been nothing but a pain
her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library
this requires a process that involves going through hoops a computer and an adobe id and software
having experience with an amazon kindle the very basic one and ipads with library books this was an absolute pain and i feel bad for my inlaws
what should be a twofive step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook
there have been several occasions where my fatherinlaw who is ok with technology has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nooki would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the nook itself
otherwise it is nothing but frustratingi dont know why i bought this tablet just only one day using it and i stored it in a place where it continues stored i dont like the screen it reflects light from many sources sun bulbs etc despite the type of technology used in the screenthe size is no convenient i think a bigger one good be better well this is my opinion about this producti have gone thru a lot of reviews of this ebook before ordering it mainly due to its long battery lifewithin a week it got shipped home excellent sellerhowever the product itself is far from being a good ebook readeri have had two one kindle ebook reader with keyboard and one  android tablet that i used as a reader mainlythe nook is cumbersomethe bads the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement then click accept 
like i am installing a new software 
 the second thing is to setup for a wifi access i have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day
cant do anything until wifi access is establishedthe goods i went to a local bn store to get instant wifi access which i didthe bad then create an account enter my credit card number why do i need to do this at this time
should only ask when i first order something from bn
the good now i can copy my ebook in pdf formats to it this part is straightforwardthe bad i opened one of my pdf doc and it came up with a huge font size try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size the menu appears then quickly disappears
i was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there it took me a few mins before i can get the menu to be stable then change to a smaller size
the text now reads fine
but the next page  previous page buttons are too hard to push it takes a hard push to get it to work i close the document and try to open another one it wont open try to reopen the first one not open eitherfrom this point on it simply refused to open any document i have on it i even convert one pdf to epub format specifically target the nook  and load on it does not open either
and the epub size is much larger than pdf size ie
i will have a lot less books on itto me this ebook is useless so i am going to return it back todayand this is not due to or lack of my high tech proficiency i develop firmware for firwmare operated gadgets by trade  really know how to use these softwarefirmware operated gadgets quite well have at least  gadgets with very complicated functionalities at home all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate  setup to my liking no problem at alli have written quite a lot of product reviews on amazon most of the gave good rating because these products are goodi feel really frustrated with this one the first bad review i wrotemy older two ebook readers work right of the box
just copy the documents to it and open to read themi will never buy these kinds of ebook readers anymore not even the new kindle as i heard they will show ads on the screen and the kindle fire will just immediately buy stuff from amazon if i accidently click on some place it does not even show a confirmation screen too greedy to make money 
i dont buy something to read these ads
amazon and b  n are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like at the users expensei will try to get a new android tablet instead for reading and internet browsing
rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not workmany users were lucky to get the ones that work touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here i was not and dont want to try my luck with it againi bought this nook simple touch on amazoncom but when i received it the wifi would not connect
i tried my home network as well as several wifi hot spots around town
barnes  noble customer service was no help telling me that since i did not purchase the nook simple touch from bn they could not help me and suggesting that i needed to return it to the seller
i did return it thinking it was damaged somehow and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument kudos to him and amazon
later i bought one from bn and it had the same problem
again bn customer service was no help but did send a replacement
the replacement has the same problem and will not connect to wifi
now im arguing with bn for a full refundmost of the reviews are glowing
but what they dont say is that bn has this wifi connectivity problem very commonly with the nook simple touch
even the bn forum has many references to the problemim not saying that you should not buy one of these nook simple touches and maybe you will not have the same problem
just bewarecaveat emptormy screen stopped working a week out of warranty
apparently this is a common issue with the nook simple touch
customer service told me that barnes  noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything
this is not the way to treat customers
i am canceling all my preorders and i will try a different ereaderno stars
be warned potential bn customer if you have a problem with a defective brandnew justdelivered nook device youre likely headed for customer service hell
be prepared to meet with an army of knownothing apparently deceptive incompetents
any merits of bns nook products are offset by the companys customer service from hell
today trying to resolve the problem of having just received a nook simple touch lemon ive been lied to hung up on and received no help at all
the return call promised by a supervisor at around six this evening never came
so around  hours later i called back and spoke to another supervisor identifying myself and asking for help
this call was disconnected on bns side and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service
ive also been advised that ill have to wait quite a while for a replacement nook though i live in manhattan and the site promises sameday manhattan delivery
id read reviews on the bn site and i believe on amazon as well about bns horrific socalled customer service
i can see now from experience that the horror stories are true
so if you buy a nook from bn and get a lemon as can happen with any edevice youre going to find yourself quite alone with your problem
whatever the merits of the kindle i know from experience that amazon customer service lives up to its name
bn customer service is essentially an insult to customers
i dont work for either company
im just a customer with a brandnew defective nook simple touch and i cant get any help from bn
so if you look at the numbers and see that kindles far outsell nooks bns misnamed customer service is likely at least part of the reasoni need to buy a gift for my mothers birthday and i know she likes to read books while on break at her job
i thought the nook would be a great gift for her after reading reviews here on amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites
our local library offers ebooks so i thought it would be greatafter getting the nook i learned a number of things the nook does not have a browser
it can only connect to the barnes and noble online bookstore
you are required to have a valid credit card even to download free content
while there is a way to root hack the nook and thus enable a functional browser it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow
i shouldnt have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionalitymy mother isnt very computer savvy and doesnt own a credit card so i couldnt give her something like this
if it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free it would be an ideal ereader
in its current form its an overlycomplicated money sinkhole
now im out  and i still need to buy my mother a birthday presenti dont know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks
claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have is a really despicable thing to doif you dont mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card and throwing money at it to read books then the barnes  noble nook is right for you
if you are looking for an easy to use ereader for library ebooks stay awaymy screen stopped working a week out of warranty
apparently this is a common issue with the nook simple touch
customer service told me that barnes  noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything
this is not the way to treat customers
i am canceling all my preorders and going to a different ereaderaside from various problems with this since the beginning now i have to charge this nook every time i want to read
it is said to hold a charge for  weeks with the wifi off but even if i only read for  minutes the next day i have to charge it again because the battery is too low
ive tried  different chargers to no avail
instructions say to leave the nook on when not in use so i do
its absolutely maddening when i return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air  but no i have to charge the fricking nook again and cant use it outside until its been charged for a long time  and then have to deal with this frustration the next time i want to readthis nook is crap and the service by barnes  noble and the seller were both zero  no service whatsoever with each party passing the responsibility onto the otheralso why is it that although the nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page when the nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so i have to remember or write down what page i left off at
this nook takes all the joy out of readingpaid  for this in april   biggest waste of money i ever spent
not worth the hassle of getting it repaired
made me miserable and unhappy for three days
this is not how i want to spend my lifefeeling miserable and abused and wondering how i got suckered into this huge mistakethe goodor perhaps the oki found nothing really goodgsm service is free for purchasing books and most uses
not all that valuable
id be happy with just wifi and enough memory to carry around a personal library
with me
gsm available for anything else but books
wifi works ok after some fussing with the settings
many times i got error messages
i kept trying until it worked
there is some issue with the wifi but it can be fussed with until it worksstarting and stopping itthe badjust about everythingi travel a lot and need to carry my library with me
this device does not work to download books outside of the us
why not
i can understand the gsm not working but if i have wifi access somewhere i should be able to load anything i want anywhere
i can load books anywhere with my ipod touch
requires a us address
why
why cant anyone use it
device requires that you sign up with bn with a credit card
why cant i download free books without a bn account
you cannot use this device until it is registeredthis device is barely functional
the interface is poorly designed bn does a great job of making it difficult to find free books and the books that are normally freebn charges you  to  for these books
outrageous
most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domainthe interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional
do a google search for nook soft rootbetter yet check out youtube and search for trookdo a search on nook itself for free and you wont find free books you will find books with free in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free
there is no menu selection for find free books
if you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same titleit would take days to find even a few interesting free books
with the kindle at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price
the bn give you nothing for free but garbage
they want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books
personally i cant see paying the same price for an electronic book as i do a paper bound book that i can resell or give as a gift
electronic books cost nothing to produce and distributewhy do they cost so much
it is gouging imhoto get a free book into your nook is a nightmare pita
i use an ipod touch and was able to load  free books into it in about  minuteseasy and simple
not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after allwith bn nook it takes a long time to select and load a book
you have to pay for a book even if it is zero dollarsanother menu choice just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button
there are lots of free books out there
why should it be hard to load these
personally i want a large library with me because i travel alot and i want to find  what i want quickly and i want to read it without hasslepfd files can be loaded but these are not resized so that type is pretty small and hard to read
i cant read them and i have reasonably good near vision
if you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired
pdf dont work well on this devicechanging a page is a pain with the controls
there is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty withi personally hate wading through  pages on the life of the author at the beginning of the book when all i want to do is read the book itself
books with a ton of crap in the front with articles about the life of the author acknowledgments are a pita toget around
scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematicsometimes you are sent back to the index other times you go to chapter one
why should i have to scroll and enter a command twice
why cant it work the first timei constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen but only the bottom is a touch screen
i found myself thinking my ipod touch is better than this
it is fast to touch what i want
give me something better like a blackberry pointer balldisplay is flashing every time a page is changed
i found this constantly annoying
why
there is no reason for the flashing
every page flashes at you
you will learn to hate it
usb power connector
this is a weak spot of the device
instead of using a robust connector they use a micro usb connector
it is wobbly
even a miniusb would have been better
at times i  could not make this connector work
it is delicate
it doesnt want to mate up
i found i needed to be very precise on aligning it even then it would not connect
i doubt that this will survive  reconnections
if you buy this device do not expect it to last more than two years
it would be smart to get the extended warranteeanother  for two yearsif you buy a nook
charge it only when you have too or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time
while the battery life is good given the crappy connector i dont understand why they didnt put a battery  times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wearmemory storage is limited to about gb with space to add another memory card
to bring it up to  or  gb it will cost you another  to  or if you buy it from bn it will be twice as much
i feel the device is worthless without at least another gb of storage
id rather it came with another gb
the ipad comes with that much or moreso you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you needthis is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that wont know any better about how badly bn crippled their android operating system and dont understand what a good interface is all aboutdo yourself a favor
try an ipod touch and i assume the ipad works as well
apple makes quality products that work right with strong connectors great software and are backed up with the highest rated customer support
bn built something with one purpose only to sell electronic booksand to make it difficult to find free books and to break quickly
if you want to be screwwed over buy one of these and then bend over because bn sees you as someone to be used and abusednot a valuable customerif bn made it easy to download free books id be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector
if bn made a decent usable interface and made it easy to load whole librarys of free books id probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business
as it is i will never buy an ebook or any other book from bn
  that is how angry i am about wasting money on this productmy nook is dead after only three days
i wish i could return it
i dont have the original packaging either so that even if i got a new replacement i cannot sell it on ebay to get my money back
im not sure what ill do
i will be calling bn tomorrow to see about a replacement and begging for a store credit instead so i can buy an ipad insteadthe bottom line is im more than disappointed about the product
im angry enough that ill never do business with bn againeven if they refund me the price of this device
i dont even want it back if it were repairedid rather pay  for an ipad purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well
while i may wish the price was less for apple products at least i dont have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by bn with their service and nook productfor those who think this is a good product
you are fools who dont know enough to make a valid judgment
i laugh at you because your nook will be dead within a yearill admit up front that when i chose the nook over kindle and sonys ereader i was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen
glitz does not equal function as i promptly found outto be fair to nook if all you want to do is read the device works and works pleasantly
i received my nook in february so it had the latest firmware updates and i experienced none of the delays in downloading missed sections of books delays in page turning that early reports noted
but if i was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons ouchthe nifty little full color touchscreen not to be confused with the epaper reading screen which is permanently grayscale just cant do its job
it responds slowly and inconsistently to touch is quirky in its response and virtually no pun intended unusable
the virtual keyboard  what a nightmare
its a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragicomedy in short orderthe unit itself is pleasant to the hand and comfortable
its also darn slick in its appearance and if aesthetics  are your only criteria well go for it
but here is why i returned the nook after one week  any optional feature such as bookmarking highlighting text and annotating it search functions for previous book marks and annotations  purely a nightmare
the processor of the nook appears to be vastly underpowered and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable
it took me  seconds after i got good at it to highlight  lines at the bottom of a page
simply not acceptablebattery life  might have just been my own unit but in  hours dead
i also experienced two full scale lockups with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutesthe nooks only advantage as far as i can tell is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on kindle
not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be functional before you bring it to marketupdate as of   i purchased a kindle after returning my nook and have been using it for three days
wow
what an incredible difference in terms of ease of use
the keyboard is very functional bookmarking and note taking is effortless the dictionary function move the cursor to a word instantly a definition pops up is wonderful
battery consumption is imperceptible after  day no visible drain my nook lasted  hours
downside of the kindle
books whose copyright had expired eg
wuthering heightsthat were free on nook are  cents on kindle
nook lists all vendors of a given book with prices conveniently visible kindle does not
irritating
lastly nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen which i found very useful
not available on kindle
overall  for my needs no contest whatsoever kindlei purchased the kindle  then a bebook because it reads pdfs and now a kindle dx for the texttospeech
the nook looks so cool until you own one
heavy copy protection even on public domain books is ridiculous
and from what i am reading on the web the books are encoded with a persons credit card  and other personal info
so  hackers can rejoice if i loose my nookanyway books are still cheaper on amazonthe color touch screen is cool until you realize that it takes up soooo much of the reading area and  costs batterymaybe next year the nook will be ready for prime timen my honest opinion nook is unfinished productnone of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middlesize fonti am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadableformula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable
i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on finetuning the text rendering on ebook readerother issue is font randomly changing from small to medium in pdf formatmy wife has had a nook for a few months and loves it
i ordered one thinking it would be great
it arrived and i loaded a part of my book collection and immediately ran into troubleif i loaded a few books all went well but when i tried to load about one hundred it gave me a message that it was looking for new items
i dont know where it went looking but it was a long long trip
ten hours later it was still out lookingi tried everything including customer service
emailed  never heard from them
phoned and the tech blamed me the books etc but never the nook
resulting conclusion from him was that i should buy books from barnes and noble so they would work
i asked why they advertized that it would read pdf and epb
he said well most of the time it reads themphoned tech again and this one said that it was defective and set up a replacement
replacement came and it was doing the same thing
i left it for nearly twelve hours and nothing happeningi googled and found others are having the same problem some believe it is related to the new update barnes and noble put out
i am no longer concerned as it is on the way backi wont rehash the nook vs kindle issue but well say i chose to buy the nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying
however  id say i made a huge mistake
i loved the way the nook worked but reliability becamea huge issue
my first nook died within  hours
i figured it was just a bad egg took it back and they completely replaced it with a brand new one
my second one died  months later
i took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it
since it is still under warranty they advised i call or email
over the last  months ive sent several emails and get autoresponses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual please call
ive also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over or my toddler starts wanting my attention etc i guess ill just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a kindlewhen attempting to live chat with their customer service i was ignored  times where the other agent never responded and then the chat timed out and had the session terminated  times for some unknown reason right after their standard its not really broken response was written
all because i wanted to know why my the touch screen on my nook stopped responding to inputthen i called and was literally cussed f word at a minute in for asking about what was wrong with their live chat
maybe i was just really unlucky and the person i talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something but i still find it unacceptableseriously go with a kindle or something else instead
amazons customer service has always been well above average for meam tired of nonstandard charging cables  i like micro usb and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro usb now
why is the nook hd using a non standard  pin charging cable
we returned the nook to barnes and noblethe advertisment for this dvd on amazon was incorrect
the ad stated that the dvd was in wide screen anamorphic format
the dvd was not in this format it was standard pan and scan and it was a poor quality transfer from the film
i thought about returning it but decided to give it as a gift
motion pictures that are filmed in anamorphic or  to  format should only be transfered to a dvd in this format
the people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised and poorly educated to artistic principlesi would love to buy this movie as i have been to hannibal missouri and been to all the mark twain atractionsto buy this movie would be a real treat but if its panscan forget it
i dont buy full screen movies
unless its made for tvi think mgm should of included a widescreen version of the moviewhat a jokea little backgroundi am a  year old man who has played around with electronics and computers my entire life
windows bit machine with gb ram blahblahblahi have struggled well over a month with this piece of trash
after this experience im done with microofts depending on consumers to fix there crap os and heading to costco to let other computers do what this device clearly will notive been waiting a while for this cover and its everything i thought it would be moleskine quality substantial feel nice holder for the ipad and a replaceable pad
the only thing missing is a pen loopother vitals you may want to know its  inches in thickness with ipad loaded thats almost an inch and a half the cover doesnt appear to be leather even though it appears to be leather
just like the notebooks interior is microsuede ipad is very secure in there spine is rounded not square you can fold back the entire thing so its flat not able to prop this thing up to view from afar too slippery and no prop is included all buttons ports and speakers are accessible looks good feels goodall that said moleskine made a mistake with their design
while they include directions on how to flip the unit around to use it for leftys when you do so the cover becomes the back and vice versa and on your new cover you now have an embossed moleskine logoupside downits bad enough they didnt bother with a lefty unit but i can handle flipping it around and having my ipad home button on top
and i can handle that once flipped the strap works the opposite of all other moleskine products since back is now front
but to have moleskine expect me to start at their upside down logo all day is more than im willing to settle for on such a pricey item
im angry that i waited for so long for a product with such a silly flawi hope they fix this but considering how long it took them to produce the case and how late it is coming to market even after it was announced i dont think that they will
too bad
could have been a great producti ordered this thing and received iti tried for hours to get it to connect to my home wifi network but to no availa couple of months later i bought a smartphone and connected to my wifi network in secondsdont buy this piece of junkthe acer aspire netbook is sold with windows xp operating system
this dvdcd burner is sold with the windows me driver a generation behind the xp
i tried downloading an updated driver from microsoft no go
i tried contacting cbear hoping they would support their product nothing
 paperweight is now what i have
amazon should drop cbear as a reseller
its not microsofts job to support cbears hardware its cbears job to support their product
not even ansering my email is not acceptabledont buy this unit
it is a dvdrom and i needed a dvd writer
it does not read dvds but read cd
absolute waste of moneyi just reread the details of this product and still can not find any mention of the fact that this device is a read only device and will not createburn cds or dvds
im very very dissatisfied with the product and with amazon for carrying itthis drive was not recognizable by either a windows  pc or a windows  tablet
got similar item  more from microcenter and it was plug and playcould not get my acer netbook to accept this devicereturned it eventually got a true plug and play lg  onehad much more lucktwo of the batteries never worked
i contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops i just figured it was not worth the effort
lesson learnedafter just two cycles of the batteries they stopped working in my tactical flashlight
i measured the voltage and found them to be almost  volts fully charged when it is supposed to be 
i dont know if this can damage a voltage regulated light but im not willing to take the chance they dont work in two separate types of flashlights i have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now
im returning these and buying some surefire nonrechargeable batteries
what good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work the batteries fail
and if you arent using it for tactical purposes then why get a light with cra batteries in the first placeeven when this charger was working only on the first cycle it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says
also the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red and doesnt charge both batteries evenlydo not buy these batteries and this little handy kit if you want a battery you can rely on
my experience using them in flashlights fenix sure fire etc has been dismal
full charge  one hour of strobe
contacted vendor and was told that these cells vary and that replacing them wouldnt helpso what would help
basically the vendor says that these cells are worthless and unreliable
is that what youre looking for
go elsewhere
the battery sucks and the vendor sucksipod gg do not support lin in microphones
do not buy unless you have a g gbdidnt work on my iphone or ipods
loved that it is compact
wasnt out much money luckily
do not recommenduseless piece of device for a device that already has a mic the performance is very average
looks smooth thoi thought i could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse
when doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was  times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic
about the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch awayit does not work
when you plug it in it disables the speakers and then the ipod is practically silent
not a good ideai dont know what i was thinking buying this piece of junk
i guess you get what you pay for
invest in quality and stay away from this thing
seriouslyi bought this on march th  suddenly even thought the storage in settings showed the card with used and free space no app could find any files on it
had to dismount remove it and reinsert it for it to work but it is erratic
while in the middle of playing mps on it all the files disappeared this is happening over and over
very disappointingi had a couple of problems with having to reset my device so it could read the sd card before
i like to save any applications i can to it to save room on my device
worked great for a couple of months after that
then since yesterday it just stopped reading and started saying damaged card and try to format
i formatted it and it still wont read the sd card
this was a horrible waste of my money
i am very upseti purchased  universal travel ac wall adapters with usb charger for my daughters trips to europe
both units worked for about  day or less when they stopped working during use
they used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers
i had also given them straight plug adapters
thank god that i did
the straight plug adapters which i bought in  still worked and lasted them the rest of the trip
good thing i also included usb charger units
so they could not charge  items at the same time since the new wall adapters broke but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugsi put in a request to return these to the seller handhelditems
and they did not honor it because i bought it a few months back but the kids trips were not until the past few weeks
i guess i should have tried them out after we first got themproduct was shipped quickly from toy  kids
at first i loved it
its compact has all kinds of adapters and very lightweight  seemed perfect for travel
my first night in italy it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery in regular outlet and ipad using the usb port
unfortunately after the nd night there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that
burnt out after just  nights
in short great idea but very little durabilitydescribed as a better cable than the one that came with the tablet
not so
mini usb doesnt fit and cord is very short
sending it back asapnot worth your stressfit loosely from the get goi have two nexus  tablets and it was the same with both
went to walmart and bought a cheap generic one and it works greatthis cable is fine except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending
i dropped my nexus  from a height of  foot onto my bed and it bent about  your best bet is the official nexus  charger but beware the usb and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my nexus bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the galaxy s and for the first  months it was working fine
bought it to replace a sandisk gb microsdhc card that was prone to have problemsafter approx  months the card stopped reading in the phone
i tried other cards and they worked in the phone
the kingston microsdhc card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer using different sd card readers
i cant format it cant even read it in the disk management viewer and cant do anything with the card now
thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesnt make me happy at all
junk cardfyi i put the gb sandisk card back in and thats been working great ever sincei used it for my galaxy s for a good  months without any problems
and just today its died
wont work at all cant recover any files cant even format it to reuse it
it is now a worthless tiny chip thanks kingston
wont be using this product again
any one else who plans on using this for a phone especially a samsung i would recommend you buy samsungs brand for the sd card
i should have done that from the start but i wasnt even aware they made an sd card brand at the time
i should have known samsung makes everythingjust to give you a brief history i had contacted citi electronics before buying this product if it is going to be compatible with my canon hf video camera
their response yes
considering how much the original one costs i went the cheaper route and it bit me right back
this cable does not work
citi electronics lied just another california bases electronics retailer selling chinese junk
now they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective
wonder if amazon even goes through a selection process anymore
overall a very very bad experience
never buying anything from citi electronics again
will have to buy original canon cable
there should be a way of actually making it zero stari was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer
used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer
changed to a heaverweight cable that worked fine
i plan to try it with a canon camcorder but i suspect it will work no better
ill probably end up returning themthis appears to be a generic charger not specifically designed for the garmin nuvi  gps at least i could find no data with the charger that tied it to this gps
i decided no to use the charger on my gps for fear i may damage it
to return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worththe price was certainly right
however at any price the product was worthless
the adapter size was ok and the cord was long enough but the connector end was wrong
the shape was correct but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the gps device it was intended for even though the amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the garmin nuvi  it was bought for
since the cost was nearly nil other than a couple of bucks for shipping i did not pursue replacement
i am still without an ac chargerthis is not a garmin charger it is a motvce it works but it not as advertised this also doesnt matter but the light is green not red also as advertisedwell it seemed to be working fine for about six hours then it began discharging my gps completely
had to charge it several hours in car to get it working againfirst of all this product charges my garmin  very slowly
i had it plugged in using this device for  hours and it still was not fully charged
you may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge it also takes this long to charge the device
the car charger will charge the  fully in about  hour
waste of my moneythis product was ultra cheap at  however it didnt work
apparently it is possible to spend too little
you get what you pay for
for  i purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard usb cord to be plugged into either
the alternate vendors product worked wellbottom linedoesnt work at allltdoes not charge nuvi ltseller took my money cause not worth returning
plug it in turns on turns off no charge
cant even work on it while plugged inthe sd card is fine
but it doesnt work with the garmin nuvi  lmt
i specifically ordered this for my gps
but it doesnt seem to be compatible with itthis product is no longer available at j and r  you enter  your information and then get to the place where it says place your order and the cart goes to 
real drag
i called jandr twice about removing this page from amazon but they said it takes timeedit turns out there are a few companies out there that still make high end cassette tapes for recording
see the link from the commenter below and also try musicians friend
dont buy this aged overstock overpriced junkwe who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard diy recorders using analog tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for old overstock hibias tapes from the s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like walgreens is a  pack cheapo maxell normal bias even these are being hard to come by
this is the case with amazon and ebay  all i can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping  neither tdk nor maxell make hibias anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact
im not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time please comment if someone knows but regardless i dont recall paying these prices when they were newi dont know if anyone manufactures new hibias tapes if anyone knows please comment anyway this is very discouraging
a home made tape was a labor of love and a sound you cannot get from digital
i still am a die hard analog diy recorder and i use an  channel analog tascam track one of the best models of  tracks made using shure studio mics and i often master to a cd burner not a pc depending on what im working with
the tracks only become mps when i rip the master cd into the computer
it has become increasingly harder to do this because of this
now i use my track mostly to record solo recordings but i have used it to record full band demos and have been able to produce near professional quality recordings
sublimes robbin in the hood was recorded entirely on an analog track as have othersdoubtful but any sellers reading this
your  year old overstock hibias tapes arent gold jerksi bought this to replace my old sony tape adapter ive had since the discman days
that one worked great until my car acura tl decided to start doing the autoreverse deal and constantly spit it out
being the cheapo that i am i wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car and i was hopeful when i saw the reviews on this adapter
however this product constantly clicks and loud enough to distract me from the music playing
also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my year old sony adapter
theres a lot of white noise and i have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where i can actually hear the lyrics of the songs
ive tried fiddling with the wire moving it in different positions and pulling the wire straight but it doesnt help
ive rendered the adapter pretty much useless and for now am stuck listening to the radio until i decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my carworks but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears  squeaking grinding crunching sounds
much worse than my previous maxell adapter
poor manufacturing
ordered the philips usa ph cdmpmdtocassette adapter for which the amazon reviews about noise are much better and its a buck cheaper to boot
indeed the philips was very good
buy it
dont buy the maxell
youll be happierupdate to review about a year after purchase the philips is making louder and louder noises
i guess noise is endemic to these adaptersi dont know why i purchased it
i dont even understand how its supposed to work anyway
mawell makes cheap products anyway
pretty sure you can find it in the dollar storehey i am a music professional
i make many recordings and service equipment so i know whats going on in the worldthis disc has a th by th piece of felt glued to a blank cd
i could have done that but i wanted professionalagain th x th
if you look on the internet it even tells you how to make these
because the lens moves you need the felt to be the entire distance of the cd plus on both side for balance
however this is a tiny dot
you would have to leave it in the player for a week in order for it to clean the lens correctly
shame on you maxell shame shamereceived the shipment ontime but the first thing i noticed when opening the box were the words not for laptop use written on the package
there was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops so since i only have a laptop i have now needlessly purchased a product i cannot usei used this product on a philips dvd recorder
horrible mistake
it must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message no disc and no playing or recording can be done
it ruined my machinetotally disappointed with this product
purchased it after reading several positive ratings on amazon but the disc did not work in my car
the car cd player kept on displaying werror while reading this discthis product arrived from high n low trading with a cracked cleaning fluid container and all the fluid long gone and dried up
it was functionally worthless and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund
i might consider buying one again but not from high n low tradingthis piece of garbage destroyed my brandnew magnavox zvmw combo player so that nothing works anymore
amazon owes me a new recorderi have three vcrs  a sony dvd and vcr player recorder a dvd and vcr  recorder and player and a third vcr playerrecorder
all take the maxell cleaner in but after about a second of play they stop
virtually no cleaning resultsit fits in a vcr and shuts it off
doesnt do anything but jam the vcr and i had to power on and off just to eject this worthless thingtried this in my sony jvc magnavox and panasonic vhs vcrs and it does not work on any of themdont wast your moneyi cannot find thm anywhere else
you all have a good price for them too
i wonder if i may order more
but first id like to find the ones i needed
you sent them to the wrong placeive had the displeasure of owning two rca brand dvd players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking
i had this dvd player and a proscan dvddivx which the salesman at  swore was the best that money could buy
the rca dvd just quit working entirely after  months microprocesor
my  proscan dvd player now displays a no disc message seemingly at random and for no particular reason
sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time others you have to try it a few times and on the worst days you may have to try  times and it still may not workin both cases i called rca sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replacercas warranty is useless their technical support line is an exercise in futility and i personally dont think its worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products
ive learned my lesson with rca and will specifically avoid their products in the futurethis radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals
in the fringe area i live in it doesnt work at allwhereas the little ten dollar panasonic rfp pocket am  fm radio works quite wellim not one to complain much but i hate old products that get mixed in with the new
this is one i should have returned but missed my chance due to events happening
this was ordered by mistake
im sure it works just not for any of my devicestrust me it does not work
i have tried it on all rooms anddoes not transmit
waste of money
if you want an item that does work i have found the sbc wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmartthese worked ok for a while then they died
reset button and repeated attempts to connect failednot recommendedthis device did not work for me
they use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal
that electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers
in an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours so in my case it was very noisy making this adapters a total waist of money
i found a similar device that uses ghz and it works great for me
but the device called dualjack could potentially interfere with other ghz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones so far i have not had any interference
you have to try them and see what works for you
joaquin arosemenadespite several attempts including changing locations i was unable to get a strong enough dial tone for my faxi have seen that a real wireless  mgh phone extension system is available in europe but not in the us where i only find powerline systemsi purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom
because of old wiring in the house the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available
while i use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room i needed a phone jack so my tivo could dial out and get programming information
when set up the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them
i purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that i could use it almost anywhere in my house
after a lot of effort i find the unit to be nearly worthlessthe range is very limited
i made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else furniture electronics etc
were in the way yet there was no dial tone
i moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units and i did get a dial tone but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to
i couldnt imagine using it with an electronic device like a modem or tivo that sends data
i got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within  to  feet of each other
needless to say with that kind of configuration its easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboardthis is only the nd item i have returned in  yrs of buying on amazon
it just doesnt work well enough to keepyou can make an outgoing call on it but it will not ring for an incoming call
no caller id no ring no nothing
outgoing call sound quality is terriblestatic and clicking noises
i tried several different jacks outlets and locations
i wanted to make sure the units werent too close nor too far from each other
tried different jacks plugs etc
made sure it was plugged directly into an outletnothing made any difference
outgoing call quality was poor incoming would never work nor ring
returned itemthis device did not work for me

i found a similar device that uses ghz and it works great for me
but the device called dualjack could potentially interfere with other ghz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones so far i have not had any interference
you have to try them and see what works for youi bought this product to connect my directv line
there is ft
between sender and receiver
all i get on my phone is static
i have tried several locations in the room
i have tried to contact rca thomson incall you get is a recording you cant get a live person
you cant even talk to a technical supportdont waste your moneythis product does not work with my base unit at all even though they are both the same brand
sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit
however is rca quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely dont work
very inconvenient for customers
it also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w base units and extensions from the amazon reviews ive read
do your homework and i would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brandthis extension requires one of the following wireless phone jack systems rca rc  ge ge or d
per packaging
it does not work with the rca rc  which amazon is bundling with it
dont buy it with the rc i used it once and my sister long distance couldnt even tell
i have used plantronics plastic tubetype microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister saidit was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head  instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder
but
i knew it was something i could learn to love quicklythe mike was not quite long enough however call me a big mouth
it didnt reach around in front of my face
it was very much to the side
just in the peripheral vision again something i was sure i could get accustomed tobut
the next time i plugged it in if i touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling
i gave up after a few more tries
i should of sent it back amazon is super about replacing items but didnt really think about it until the warranty had expiredi am ready to try again
but this time will read all the reviews before purchasingthere appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire
i have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you
this is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the pricethis is the worst headset i have ever owned
i bought so many of them over the years i dont remember anymore how many went bad
at least  the reason i keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets dont work well with a uniden cordless phone
uniden requires a specific impedance otherwise voice quality is not goodcalling uniden is worthless
they are of no helpi actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the mm plugim not buying anymore uniden phones or headsetsthis is the th wireless phone jack i have purchased
it worked for maybe  months then died
tried to reset but it would not connect
do not buy this productused this for all of about  minutes
couldnt connect at all
gave one star only because i couldnt give unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise
i was able to connect to the internet at th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection
i will give this to another family member to try in a newer housethe people who rated this highly only used it for tivoi have vonage and i wanted this to put my telephone in a place different than where my vonage router is in my apartment and it works horriblyi spent over an hour trying multiple different connections and distances and came to the conclution that the only way it works is if they receiver is in the same jack as the sending device
so disappointed
i got it for  so im not that mad but still i paid for something i should not have bought in the first placethis kit is absolutely horriblefirst off the scratchfree cloths it comes with arent scratchfree at all
they totally scratch the cdthe step  scratch removal is not scratch removal at all
it is supposed to sit for  minutes then you wipe it
i let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still thereafter you apply that junk the instructions say to apply step  cleanerpolisher and sealer
this stuff is practically water
it doesnt work at allafter you do that the cd should be like new
i dont think sothe holder that you put the cd on while youre cleaning it is too flimsythe only good thing that i use the scratch remover for is small scratches on my digital camera cell phone psp and other electronicsdo not buy this unless you like ruining cdslast wordi hate maxellafter reading the reviews on here i was hesitant to use the product i had just purchased
but i figured what could i lose  it was already skipping and if this didnt work id just buy a new copywell im here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important forget it
the cd was left with more scratches than before the protective pad actually makes scratches worse than a paper towel and its just a horrible product
i followed the directions to a t thanks maxell for wasting my money and my timei bought this repair kit so i could watch a rental movie
it had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts
after i was done i had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did beforei bought  of these kits hoping they would work
i have found them absolutely useless at  per kit
i will continue to search for a productsystem that really worksthis product is crap
i followed the instructions to the tiniest detail i am a very methodical person and it didnt remove the scratch that my dvd has and it added several more
i read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions but i am not willing to do that the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work
following the instructions it ruins your cd or dvd even further
dont wast you time money and your cd  dvd and take it somewhere where they can buff itbought these for a long airplane ride
they worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out
that seems to be pretty common with this set
also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one sidei had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely
fiddling with the cord doesnt help
for  i expected much better quality
i am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says maxell again  you cant trust anybody these days theyve all gone for cheap and to heck with qualityi got these headphones in june
by august the sound in one ear was cutting out
i could move the wire and get it back temporarily
fine if you dont move your head
now its october and the sound in that ear is gone for good
that good price for noise cancelling headphones isnt so great for only  months
guess they are meant to be disposabledont waste your moneyi ordered micro cassettes and got these i was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller got exactly what i wanted so i am happy
i did not try these out
i dont have a standard cassette recorderim not brutal with equipment but in a few short weeks the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side
within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing togetheri use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep
a second convenient bedside charger would be nice
i tend to put them down on the bedside table before i doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge
if youre a  late night tv watcher you too might call this justifiable laziness
too many times i put them on the next night and find the batterys downi honestly think that before i replace them with another wireless id find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone when i dropped them a day after getting them home the right earpiece shattered revealing the inside of a very cheap product
 the description doesnt tell you that you have to tune the transmitter then tune the headset until the signals coincide
that takes a little doing to get it right and i find that the two parts lose each others signal several times over the course of a couple of hours
i have to retune the base and the headset each time they lose each other
it also has an annoying whine most of the time also
since last xmas it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores which is a shame because it is so badthis product is a wast of moneyit is not thing but a cd disc with some soft brushes on it for to spinning around trying to clean the cd player laser eye and this cd disc thing cant clean the laser eye at allmost portable cd player this day are lid open anywayyou properly can clean the laser eye with a cotton swab with a dip of a little rubbing alcoholthat what i used this product fordont waste the moneyused multiple times on two different units did nothing to eitherdont bothertried this on our  toyota highlander
the cd player wouldnt even read the disk
tried several times
dont waste your moneyin order to read on the package instructions that the cleaning cloths may scratch your discsbut instructions say dont worry it wont affect the playing i ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching themso i was totally horrified by this information
i currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician
no problem with scratches but more expensivei returned this product because i was afraid as the package warns that i could scratch my discs
i would not have ordered if anyone had mentioned this information on the website so i could evaluate the risks and make a wise buying decisioni was looking for velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many ipadiphone cables i carry through
these ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess aroundone inch of the eight is the name tag belkin another inch is the hook portion of velcro
if there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped it all comes undone except that  of valcro what a waste of money
buy something else i am having tothe whole tie velcro to  it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of velcroitem that arrived was opposite gender from what is pictured both ends
in addition one of the pins was badly bentsomething easily fixable but not in condition to sellthis item did not work for both an led monitor or for my desktop pc
for the price im just going to throw it away
although the plug has the right shape it fits loosly in the socket of the devicei bought this exact same cable in the  foot length a couple years ago and was very pleased with it and needed a longer length for my new setup
so i went to look for a  foot length of the same brand same model as it were
found it this one
ordered it
received it
opened itand then it hit me
the stench
the cable i got reeked of chemical plasticy rubbery odor that was highly unpleasant
this wasnt the case with my  foot cable
perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket
or just simply changed suppliers
i have no idea
but if you have a sense of smell at all avoid this cable
i ended up buying a dynex  cat e ethernet cable from best buy for too much money
what can i say i needed it right then
something very similar is sold on amazon for a lot less but it doesnt look exactly the same although it probably is
if it is the same then i can tell you that the dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket materialbuyer bewarethey sent a different product
does not say that is made by belkin anywhere on it
they sent me a rj cable made by foxxconn e
this does not have the protected cover snagless over the release lever as shown in the pictureitem description
im not happy i do not plan to buy from this company againthis thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room
i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists
i could download it from the from pirate bay but thats illegal and unsafe
so i have all these pictures of dear family members some of them are dead and i cant retrieve themi got  yes answers to my question about whether this iomega zip drive works in windows  before i bought it
no one however who answered had ever actually tried it in win the software for this drive took down win  and i had to do a reset to get it to restart windows
major flawit does not work in windows   acer computersi have applied for a refundupdate  i tried to load it after the fail on win  on a laptop i have with win   after loading the software windows would not start and still will not
i would not try it on win  unless you know what to do when it wont start
i have to have mine repaired and minimum repair is 
thats a high price to pay for just trying a product that was defectivewhen will amazon wise up and allow no stars for a ratingthis is so cheaply made it is worthless
the battery compartment is held in place by a tiny plastic bar
broke almost immediately on my unit making the thing totally useless with out the battery compartment locked in place it simply doesnt work
they might as well have made the cable out of a piece of stringdont waste your moneylike many other people here my lock jammed
luckily i didnt pay for it my company did
worked for about  months and then just stopped working
i dont think it magically reset its own combination
mechanical locks dont do that
more likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed
my it guy had to saw it off
did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptopsimply put dont use this productgreat while it worked
imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home
yikesthis is not a review of the product but i thought this information may be good to know before you order
could save someone money and frustrationi ordered this defcon  unit  in april  and received a devcon cl combination lock and cable  that was improperly labled with an amazon sku label listed improperly as a defcon  unit
it arrived in a clear plastic pack so i could see it was the wrong item
if i did not have prime it would likely have cost me shipping
prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund so i was ok with this
just fyi if you are ordering this and paying for shippingit looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a  rv voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping
but rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same amazon seller i opted to use something else
amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens but you would probably lose it if you requested a refundbe aware this is the first time an amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over  years of business with amazon i am very happy with amazon and appreciate their costomer service so i just wanted to help if you pay for shipping
sorry this is not a review but i hope this helps someonewow
i am enraged right now at this godforsaken pos laptop lock
let me set the scenei go into the library for a nice long afternoon of studying
i dont feel comfortable leaving my laptop on the table whenever i go to the bathroom so i bring this targus defcon cl along to secure my computer for whenever im not at the table
i connect it and get on with my studying
come dinnertime i feel its time to go so i put the combo in the lock and it wont unlock
wtfi am getting frantic thinking maybe ive gone insane and forgot the combo which would be impossible since its the digits of my freaking date of birth
desperate i google targus defcon cl wont open
lo and behold this exact same thing has happened to hundreds of other people
the amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you
now im trippin out so i start googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo
luckily engagdetcom did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these thingsi drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters and come back to cut the cable
takes me about  minutes to cut through with a  wire cutter something a person can have in their pocket while youre away from your comp spend  min and be off with your laptop in their hands
unfortunately during that  min duration someone reports me to the librarian because they think im trying to steal a laptop
i have to log in to the computer to prove that its mine
slightly embarrassing but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo but was pretty easy to cut throughso to recap the reasons this is the worst product i have ever purchased it will randomly change the combo
this has happened in more cases than not google it the cable literally takes  minutes with a mediocre set of cutters to get through
anyone can take your laptop if you are off in the bathroom or something for a bitthis device has a major design flaw and does not prevent thieves from cutting it up
i used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter
mind you the lock portion was destroyed not the cable
the thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers
basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidablyequipped metal cutteri bought this product veeeery long time ago and never used till  moths ago
i bought in  and i used on september  for first time because i needed
i had a very  dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap
i needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off so i split the power and it was everything ok and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic
me and my roomate saw it and yes the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen what if we just leave and leave this protector running i am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back
in other words i had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection my  dollar protector extension workd better than this pice of s because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt
be carefull pelase and save money
just keep an eye  on this if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will not protect instead this will burn your house try by yourself if not beleive it
if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on firei used my outlet surgearrest protector to protect my home office equipment
one day poof went my computer during a quick power outage
the incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for apc to handlesent my unit in for eval as they request
they said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product they would not compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being friedare they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge it may be a case of the movs not blowing
movs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage protecting your electronics from the surge
their device failed to stop a surge failing to protect my equipmentmy advice  if your equipment and data are valuable to you then purchase one of the seriesbased surge protectors apc does not make these
as they say you get what you pay for
except with apc who fail to honor their warrantiesfor those who insist on using cheap surge protectors i hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of deer whistles
same sales principle  make them cheap enough for everyone spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product
if apc sold deer whistles and a deer hits your car they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defectivethe product may not have failed mechanically or electronically but it certainly failed to provide protection
pay up apcthe point of purchasing the apc surge protector was to increase the safety for my equipment and homenow the company has recalled their older products ours was purchased in march due to potential fires during very unusual conditions
instead of more safety we had lessthis is unacceptable for this type of product and causes concern about my other apc surge protector that i purchased later but was not in the recall
does the later product not have the same problem or has it not been out long enough for customers to report problems
i chose to avoid the possible risk and to replace it with a different brandalso unacceptable is the only recourse for the consumer is to apply for a newer model
a better company would have offered a full refund optionneedless to say i will not be purchasing any more apc productsthis is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market
the consumer is fooled into thinking that this quothard casequot is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim  when in fact the case is made of plastic and has two very thin strips of  aluminum outside the plastic
this case could easily crack under little  pressure
i purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case
for  bucks you think  youd get something nice and strong but save your hardearned money for  some other case
if you want just something to protect your palm v in id  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case
even better go for the leather case that has a  zipper
for even more protection go for the rhinoskin palm protectors
those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your palm if you damage  itthe only reason why you should buy this flimsy overpriced  quothard casequot is if you have a lot of money to blow care more  about looks than functionality and dont care if your palm actually gets  damaged
this case will pop open when you dont expect it and who knows  what will happen to your palms paneli was going to buy one of these cases for my new palm vx
it looked great and i figured if it was made by palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toyi mean toolsafe
fortunately i saw one in a store before i  ordered one
as some of the other reviews have said its made out of  cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration
the  hingers are fragile and the springloading is weak
i dont think its  worth the cost and ive seen them as low as if youre buying a  hardcase im assuming you want some protection for your palm
this wont  give it to you
if you just want something that looks good to coverup  there are lots of nice leather ones out thereas for me i decided to  spend the extra money on a rhinoskin molded aluminum case
ill let you  know how that goes
so far so goodcheck them outim so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases
they were great a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center
somebody could have sat on it and it wouldve been fineas two previous posters have mentioned theres a problem with this product  theres no template readily available for their use
the packaging directs you to a memorex site that is defunct
you can search and find a thirdparty program that promises it will do what you need while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well
i would not install it as it seemed unsafe
i tried contacting memorex but go no response
this left no real options for their usei needed to print my inserts asap though and didnt have time to find something else so i divised a template of my own  with trial and error it worked more or less
it was very time consuming though
memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they arent going to legitimately support iti installed per instructions beign always grounded with a wrist strap wired to live ground circuit
when i turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard
took it to local tech who said newly installed board was bad and caused the motherboard to short out
ruined computeri was actually pretty excited to get these but when it arrived it was defective
the monoculars didnt align causing me to see double and  picture not as one
also there seemed to be a scratch of some sort on the right monocular
i tried to clean or blow it out to see if it was just an eye lash but it never went away
i sent them back for a returni was really looking forward to getting these binoculars
i had owned bushnell binoculars in the past and was very happy with themthese arrived totally brokenthe left main lens housing was sheared completely off from the unitlooking at them i found they were constructed using cheap plastic for the main body
the lens housings are screwed into the body but the plastic is so fragile that apparently when they were dropped sometime during the shipping process the plastic shatteredi probably could have superglued the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped
nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from foggingwhile checking out the remainder of the unit i worked with the quick focus lever and found that it didnt hold focus very well either
i would like to see a unit that has a dial focus with a lever fine focus so that the major focus point is stable
the lever focus would be really nice for finer focusing after you have zeroed in on the subject
i would have used them for viewing auto racing for the most part so once you get the major focus point clear a lever focus for fine focusing would be great for viewing a moving target like race cars that can vary in distance by up to  of a mile closer or further than the main focus point as the cars travel around the track
that is where the quick focus lever could do a great job
but to use it for the entire focus field is too much and it isnt fine enough since a tiny bump in the wrong direction can cause you to lose sight of your target object entirelyi also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down
either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as welli wont be reordering a replacement
instead i will look for binoculars that have a more durable housing since using binoculars subjects them to being knocked around and if the material used by bushnell shatters so easily they are not going to last very longso my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter
if you use them in winter they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have nowi would also advise bushnell to change their packaging since if they make a product that is this fragile they should pack it in thicker shock absorbing materials than they currently do since what they use wouldnt protect a product a fraction of the weight and bulk of this product
that would lessen the chance of catastrophic damage such as these were obviously subjected tomy cell phone which weighs  ounces came in a corrugated box with a total weight of one pound with  ounces of that being the box and packing materials the charger weighs about  ozyet these binoculars that weigh  times as much as my cell phone with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box
it is a miracle if any of these binoculars get to the customer in one piecethey arent wideangle as advertised
they dont fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses so one always sees double
i had several friends try them and they all said the same thing so it isnt just me
with a name brand like bushnell i thought i couldnt go wrong but apparently their quality control is nonexistent
i ordered these while traveling out west and couldnt send them back until i got home
i tried to return them but amazon said the last return date was one day before so i am stuck with these useless binoculars
i need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to themi read other review and decided to give it a try
as soon as i recieve it in the mail and opened the box i realized this was a mistake
cheap quality binocular with high power being a selling point
it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart
you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place
it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation
you will be constantly ajdusting the focus
your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it
indeed strap case lense protectors are all cheap crap and annoying to have it all on
i am taking this back and buying made in japan nikon eagle view  times better
you get what you pay forit is absolutely useless
the pictures are grainy blurry and have color aberrations galore
you cant even see facial features on people
it is not a true x camera it uses software to obtain the x advertised resolution
downloads are horribly slow and the memory is not removeable so you cant use a better download method
it will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the mb memory
this thing is not even useful as a toy for your children
fortunately i bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back and even refunded all shipping charges
do yourself a favor and get an olympus dl or dz
a lot more money but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent picturesdo not buy this camerai bought two of these for my kids and they are awful
the picture quality is so low that only about  of the photos are worth keeping
and being for my young children my standards are very low
i bought them almost as a toy and still im severely disappointed
do not buyi bought the smile to have a handy inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages
i didnt want to spend  on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months
i figured for  i couldnt go wrong
i was mistakenthe smile just has too many compromises
the lens is a tiny fixedfocus item that requires bright light to form an image
battery life is abysmal it seems to chew up a pair of aas shooting a dozen pictures
i should have spent  and gotten a far better camerastop
 this camera is not x is a fixed x
ccd is not  even  megapixel is  i think
images are bad like enlarging a  thumbnail
print them in an x inch rectangle and theyll be somehow  fine anything bigger is like old cga awful
when you take shots they  look very bad whatever you do to  edit software and fix them
i have  another true x camera and pictures are excelent but these  it doesnt include an ac adapter so be prepared to buy lots of aa  batteries or spend another  bucks fine as a serial videoconference  camera  fps but watch for the batteries take your first picture  and begin to wonder if its ok the lack of an lcd screen begins to bother  you when you find out you cant review your shots
think about it you wont  review your pictures untill you get to the pcsorry i am very  disappointedim on a small budget this summer so i bought this camera for fun
it doesnt drain your batteries before you even took a picturei took about  pictureswithout flash with my cheap rechargeable batteries
the four  stars missing is for the worst quality ive ever seen in my life
i suggest  to never use the flashall my pictures taken with flash were  full of  light so its all white
this camera is too cheapi think that my  batteries heavier than the camera itselfyou only have to put the cd  that it comes with it and it installs itselfi think uploading my  pictures to my pc took  minutesthe camera was too easy to use and  i wonder why agfa made these thingsfinally digital cameras are too  expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take  better pictures you will regret buying this awful camerathese speakers do not sound bad dont get me wrong
if the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner
however even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of cambridge soundworkscreative labs computer speakers i have that cost about the same pricethe subwoofer seems fine but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the creative labs speakers
for gaming they sound fine but music clearly sounds better on the creative labs speakers to mebut where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring
unlike the creative labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation the altec lansing set has very short cables
the left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer
then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left
then to add insult to injury the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speakerworst of all they hardwire everything
on the creative labs system the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites
wonderful and simple design
the altec lansings have wires of nonstandard configuration hardwired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hardwired between the speakers maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it but do you want to
the easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience
dump these babies for the better sounding creative labs setupi was very disappointed with this productas one other reviewer said the stem is too short
so others can hardly hear me
obviously if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product
for instance ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you
and im short myself so its definitely  not a matter of my having oversized headmouth dimensions
but even when i took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low though without background noisei also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment
i dont have a need to wear one all the time but just for certain calls
i often found myself fumbling to get it on
i think ill try an overthehead model nextthe mike wand is only   inches long
since i have  inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low
it was otherwise comfortable and i imagine it would be fine for a person  with a smaller faceplugged this into a talkabout t and it just transmitted
transmit button didnt work vox didnt work
i have a pair of some older model i should try the headset on thosewould give this  stars if i couldthe item served its use however not the quality i thought it was priced atvery dissatisfied with this the earphone earbud is fine but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone
even a females voice usually more clear than a males voice is very hard to understand using the microphone
i have also not been able to get the ivox feature to work with this eitherit looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my way radio i soon realized its a joke
you can hear people through it but couldnt talk through it
i had to unplug the mic if i wanted to talk to anyone
 waste of 
i would return it but my luck with getting my money back when i return something isnt good since i never do
save your  and buy something elsenot sure if these tapes are knockoffs but these tapes jam in our sony bm portable recorders
they seem to work ok in our lanier desk recordersif we hold one of the the sony cassettes next to a tdk cassette which work fine in the bm the tape in these sony cassettes looks visibly tallerunfortunately we are stuck with about  packs now
i do not recommend this seller or these tapesjr music and amazon must be kidding to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a used product
to bury the fact that this item is reconditioned at the very bottom of a multipage description instead of in the title or first line is deceitful
they are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice itbeauty is deceiving
the worst thing about this radio is that the plastic onoff button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach
get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick
keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best and confusing to use
the plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion
thousands of these must be sitting in drawers silenced by the elements
junkthats why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailersdo not buy
my father bought a new yb for me for a graduation present in   i have never been able to pick up any sw station
i am in colorado now km away from the high power time stations and i cant pick them up
just hear buzzing noises
nothing on lw either
am mw reception is poor but it does get some stations
this was really expensive to turn out to be an fm clock radio
the fm reception is good the clock works fine the light is nice
equivelent to a nice  radio for  times the pricei have been using belkin cat cables for a long timethey come with a stamp and specs on the wire and the connectors have a belkin logo embedded in themthe one i received does not have the belkin name anywhere on the wire and the connectorssure its a fakeif i had to buy any cate i could have spent only  including shippingmay be this fake cable works good but the seller should not deceive people by saying its a belkin cablebuyer bewarethe first two times i plugged this into my projector it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected
now i cant get it to work at all
unfortunately i had it over a month before i tested it so now i cant return itvery unhappy with this
setup was a breeze contrary to much i have read but the picture quality is horrible because this camera is very used and very beat up
upon first connect the images were a total washed out blur
i removed to lens to clean it all and it looked like milk or oil had been spilled all over this camera in the past
after much cleaning the images are now almost recognizable
still very poor i cant believe someone would sell a product new or used in this poor condition
zero stars if i could
my  labtec cam takes far better pictures
the com homeconnect might be good i dont know because the one i got is in such bad shapemine is a just over a year old
guess what
yep its croaking
in fact every sony product i bought the past decade  a phone  portable cd players a tv and now this  failed just after the warranty expired
ive finally learned my lessoni charged this battery up and tried it in my garage door opener remote  it used to open from about  feet away but now it barely works at  feet
id recommend that you stay away from this v
i have been quite happy with the other nimh sizes from energizerthey dont hold a charge
i have found its a lot cheaper to buy regular duracell batteries at costco and just keep replacingthis battery like other rechargable batteries i own is rated for  volts and im told is likely even less
why not go with maha
its rated at over  volts which for my applications powering a headroom micro dac makes all the difference
i can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices designated power requirements is better across the boardim a strong supporter of rechargeable batteries but at  volts this just doesnt meet my needs
devices that use batteries are designed to work across a range of voltages because as the battery is used the voltage slowly drops until the battery just runs out of juice
when the dying battery crosses a certain voltage threshold some devices warn you of a low battery
this is a good thing because you dont want say your smoke alarm to need to go onto backup battery power and not have the juice it needs
the problem here is that the devices i use seem to cross the low battery voltage threshold somewhere around  volts
that is to say i put a fully charged battery in there and before i know it about  week or  the low battery light comes on in my answering machine or the smoke alarm starts doing its low battery beeping thing
nope this is no good
i suggest you steer clear of energizer and go for another brand that has an  nominal voltage or better yet  if that extra v isnt going to harm your devicenimh cells go in increments of  v so as far as i know there is no way to get a  v batterysure this will work in many devices but i really dont see why energizer opted to go for a v battery instead of v other than to save a small amount of money
that seems like a very offbrand sort of thing to do
 star only from mei wanted a palm vx because i love the looks but finally settled on the palm xe for several reasons
  the hassle of charging a vx when travelling is greater than the benefit of not dealing with batteries in  general use
and a cradle or more expensive travel kit is needed for use  with a second computer or travelling
  the cost of vx accessories are  too high
i liked the xe because i wanted to hot sync my computer at home  xe travel cable is only  compared with  to  for vx with my  computer at work where i used the included cradle free with purchase
and  the bulk of the vx cases made them as big as the xe with included  flip lid
and this cradle is  on top of the price of the vx
the  bottom line the the nice looks of the vx cost  more with all the  accessories like a case and travel kit
not worth it
id rather have two  xesi used once
very bad quality
i bought a manfrotto tripod
i love itit would not work
the software would install properly
i will be returning the item
very disappointed in the producti plugged it into my computer and nothing
tried it in several different computers windows  and windows  and the device is completely dead
will not be recognized by computers
the worst part is i cannot return it as of a few days ago
i would recommend trying a different brand star because it doesnt workapple  imac  drive wont even register just clicks awayapple  macbook air  same as abovems windows  on a  acer laptoppulled up directions at mfr
website
fludrv model number not found  its under sbtufdb
anyway plugged drive in windows  installed the driver checked to ensure it mounted
i even had windows search for an updated driver
nope the current one is good
then the fun inserted a mb floppy disk with data the drive did not activate any windows window like a cddvd does
i had to bring up windows explore to view the drive
clicked on it the drive actuated  click spin zoom zing the green status bar showed progress
but alas message window
this disk in the drive is not formatted
wow
eject
insert blank floppy with the tab set to unlock
again had to select from the explore window
again click spin zoom zing
oops disk needs to be formatted
select okay
now it was hummin
windows green status bar once again showing progress  the drive is spinning  green light on  then stop
then a new window pops up with formatting options
all fields looked correct so i selected the format button
one more time for click spin zoom and zing
then stop
new window  windows cannot format the drive
several attempts followed to get this thing to work
shut down the pc
booted with the drive connected  no dif
tried different usb ports  no difms windows  on a  toshiba laptopsee aboveim not sure whats up with sabrent and their models
i purchased the fludrv
there is no manual on their website for it
there is for the sbtufdb though
i took a chance on a product that had  negative reviews  out of  were  stars and below
the sbtufdb fares no better with  out of  reviews rated  stars and below
thats 
guess ill keep lookingbottom line  its going backwas terrible did auto connect and was complete waste if time thanks for telling it doesnt always work good goingwish i read the reviews here more completely
this was a complete piece of trash
like with others the speaker would not play for more than  seconds at a time no matter what i did
after a while i could feel that the speaker was over heating so i left it unplugged
sure enough it came back and played for another  seconds and then quit
its going back to amazon immediatelyi wouldnt waste my time on this product
the range isnt nearly what was advertised
it says  feet but i can barely get them to work across the room
its even worse in a twostory house
god forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside
they are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying highpitched whine
even the slight motion can interfere with the signal
i should have returned them when i had the chanceon the first try the outdoor speaker played for  seconds then stopped working
i returned to amazon no charge and got a replacement speaker
opps same thing the speaker played nicely for  seconds and then went dead the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played
i emailed amazoncom and wanted to role the dice and give it a rd try
amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one
they refunded all my money also gave me a  credit in my account for the hassle
i was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue
should i give the speaker another try
i really did like the product if it would only work
ive searched the customer reviews and this problem is not isolated to me
well if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after  seconds
it seemed like a solid product but at the low price of  im not surprised it failed to work
please leave feedback as i would like to order anothrer myself but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy amazon tries to make it
also i wanted to mention that it was very generous of amazon to give me a  credit for my troubles with the speaker amazoncom is a very reputable company i recommend them strongly and i will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future
best of luck with this onealthough i own two indoor advent wireless speakers which are excellent this one is horrible
constant static whether from a radio or cd
it has trouble tuning to the stereo although it used the same transmittoras my indoor speakers
actually it was closer to the stereo
but it never held a staticfree sound regardless of position
i am going to buy a third indoor speaker use it on the screen porch and occasionally on the deck
much better sound with speaker and tweeterand look for another wireless speaker because unless you are overwhelmed and enraptured by the audio quality delivered by a close and play or an eight track you will be disappointed
and this is shocking because usually advent makes great speakersto give you a sense of perspective realize that i do not demand or own ultrahigh end components
my entire setup cost less than  dollars includes amp  cd changer dvd player and  boston acoustic floor speakersi purchased the aw unit to play light jazz or rock im over   ouch
 out on my deck
i thought it would help take the edge off the day the music along with an extra dry martini
instead of being smoothed by the hipcat sounds of miles davis or the dead i found myself constantly running to the speaker to retune it oftentimes causing me to spill my drink  ouch again
netnet sound is thinner than a razor blade range is abysmal  and you actually have to tune the speaker to get reception my unit turned orange after being exposed to sunlight for a week im not kidding
 the volume of this unit can be drowned out by a snoring cricket this speaker simply does not meet the high standards that advent has set for their other speakersi supposed location is everything
up here in alaska i found this radio to be rather limiting if not almost useless
reception proves to be very weak tuning isnt the most exact science here and quality of this radio wasnt very high
i brought this radio from rei and within a year the speaker cover fell off they were just glued in and my tuner dial fell apart
needless to say this wasnt grundigs finest efforti did get good ampm reception within the city limits but i can do that with almost any radio
sw modes were limited even on a clear nights on top of a mountain
its a weak radio probably good in a very civilized part of the world but worthless out where you really need it
small size is nice but why carry a radio around if you cant pick up anything once the city lights are no longer in sightive used this product for about an hr now and its going backcant stand its sound quality  one tone shrill sound
hurts my earsstay away from this onethis disc could not be read in either of my dvd players
refund requested
would not pruchase this item
do not buyd this is my first review of any product on amzn
i had to add a comment after reading the other reviews
i am not alone
these errors have been a continual headache and from what i see from the reviews turning to sony will be to no avail
ah well sony has lost a dvd customer
i have the wega which is a great picture so im not uniformly prejudiced against sony products
and the dvd player when it has worked has been great
but the hitches have increased in frequency until lately i simply get no disc error
the reader scans back and forth for about  seconds until it gives up
and im giving up too
i am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem points to a generalized issue which i hope sony can take care oflet me get right to the point
when this dvd player was working it worked well
good picture quality reliable service reasonable remote
when it workedunfortunately this particular generation of sony products falls victim to sonys perplexing high failure rate and infant mortality problems
after only six months of very moderate use suddenly the unit refused to play newer dvds instead displaying an quotinsert discquot message
soon thereafter we got the dreaded quotcquot error on the screen and front panel of the player indicating that the unit had essentially failed
now i can play a few older singlelayer dvds but not newer duallayer dvds
in researching the c error via google it appears that sony refuses to recognize the massive number of people experiencing this problem
now it appears that some classaction lawsuits may be headed sonys way from some very upset customers
i am certainly one of themso caveat emptor
sony certainly is an innovative company but their quality control and longevity engineering is woeful as evidenced by the huge number of failures experienced by this product
thus i offer a resounding one star for poor performance by sonygenerally speaking i love sony products however i have found that when they need to be repaired they are never good for long
case in point was my purchase of this dvd player
it broke after  months with a c error
i took it in and they shipped it back to me  weeks later
it then broke   months in the exact same way
i took it in and it was fixed for  months before breaking in the exact same way
it was out of warranty this time but because it had been defective so many times they fixed it
well you guessed it
now it is broken againwhen the machine works it is great
but it has broken too many times for my tastesdoes not work at all on my brand new pc se usb very bad software support is helpless advertised audible format is not actually supported yet they say dont buy now this is a rushed out though late  buggy productdiamonds has created a major dud w this product
i will never again purchase another diamonds product nor will i allow someone to do so wo hearing me out firstfor starters  the box says that its firmware is upgradeable to  support higher memory capacity at a later time
then after wed already  bought it  they said they wouldnt upgrade the firmware past mb cards
a huge uproar came about from all the owners since other companies were  supporting the mb cards
finally they relentedthen the new rios  wont support the memory cards that you buy for this product
and memory  is the most expensive part
there wont even be some sort of an expansion  pack  the new rios will use a proprietary type of memory which means you  cant use it in your pda or camera  and youll pay a lot of money for it  toothen there product is highly bugey
crashing often it has huge  battery issues
for instance  if youre transfering data and the battery  dies then the unit has to be reset at the factory
and this happens a lot  because unlike other usb products that are powered off the usb bus the rio  drains batteries like crazy when transferring files
i end up having to  put in a brand new battery every time i transfer files just because i dont  want to deal w a factory resetthe usb cable  not sold anywhere so you  cant get a replacement
you have to get rd party software to download mps  to the rio because what it comes w is useless
the cdrom it comes w has  rd party software that you can only use for  days thankfully musicmatch  and realjukebox will take care of thatthe rio will not be upgraded  to support some of the new codecs wma which are half the size of mps
the rio comes w it  so obviously theyre recognizing that this new  codec is the way to go but they wont support their older productsand why not
this quotolderquot product is the most current product  available by them to date
and its not like after shelling out  for a  unit  youre willing to quotupgradequot to another player in   monthsare you getting the feeling that theyve upset me a bitwow what a frustrating product
the technology is so tantalizing but the realization through the rio  is so bugridden that it drove me crazy
i  am returning the product
some of the problemso the software from  diamond or from audible to program the rio is truly horrid the worst  software ive seen in many years
it crashes so frequently that you will  be pulling your hair outo the documentation is a joke
the  quotmanualquot is two pages long
and no the product isnt intuitive  so you dont need a manual
look forward to lots of trial and error as you  learn it yourselfactually the hardware part is ok and the sound is  joyous on those rare occasions when you can get it programmed
but for me  the trouble overwhelms the joy
ill be returning mine and looking at a  creative nomad or some nextgeneration mp playerhaving been a professional photographer for over  years i expected nikon to produce superior results
forget that the camera is difficult to use the final quality of the pictures is poor
if you shoot only in sunlight  or shadow its ok but mix them and the result is unacceptable
no  latitude or gamma and even photoshop fails to correct the problems
maybe in the future but until then buy something to play with but use  real film
i returned minewe bought one of these labelers
the first surprise came as we started to use it
as has been noted at length by another reviewer on this page these labelers are designed to waste the tape
ok we thought
whateverthen when the tape ran out we purchased more via amazon
wow these refills are unreasonably expensive
brother clearly has a give away the razors and sell the blades philosophy seemingly making all of their money on the tape
but we bought it anyway cause what else were we going to do
we were stuckwe got the tape inserted it correctly
but the cartridge was faulty and it unraveled on the second label
irreperable
so we called brother and  guess what  the tapes have no warranty
so unless you are in the mood to give brother a blank check for your labeling needs dont get into bed with them
they will leave you angry and wantingi got this and the cobra antenna
this thing does not pick up hardly anything i am not sure its even working
i can pick up the weather radio but everything else seems to be crap
i am sending this back not happy
its a good idea but it dont workused it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a vhf radio
reach is minimal even two cars driving next to each other doesnt allow for good communication
go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a vhf if you want long distance good quality communicationthe discription sounded good but after i bought it and put it to use i found it to be not as advertised and returned itdefective unit scan function worked  out of  battery trays are very poorly made
the eight battery compartment would not power the unit
if the unit was working as designed i would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders
as they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues
audio was acceptable and it did bring in the noaa clearlyi would to have give this one star out of the box i could not get anything the weather channel came in great all the other channels not so much also would say get a outdoor antenna that help a lot now i can hear some people on radio also the cigarette adapter is great the only problem i have is when i hit the gas on my truck i can hear my engine threw the cb speaker which lowers the  quality of the sound i have to shut my truck off so i can not hear my engine threw the cb speaker
i would not buy this cb at all not worth the money and pain the only good channel i found again was the weather channelvery unhappy with this cbi ordered the  in may of   the receiver went deaf in august and i returned it to midland for warranty repair
they sent me a replacment in september and by november the receiver had failed in the new one
the radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down
when the radio would receive signals the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said
the transmitter in both units still worked
dont waste your moneyafter reviewing the opinions on this unit a friend of mine and myself decided to make the purchase anyway
there were  star and  star reviews
after several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a  mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again
both transmission and reception distances are shameful
even when using no ground plane antennas
straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about  feet
we also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in cb
his trans and rec was great but ours was terrible
the unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for  miles
 is more like itpurchased this cb from best buy
it would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle
most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once i made a call to the company i figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb
after going through that it didnt work
i am sending it back and will not be reorderingbe honest 
if you buy this cb transceiver radio youre going to need a miracle to make if work
i tested with my girl friendas soon as i walk away  meter  from her i couldnt heard anything and get any signalim not sure how can people give  star review to this productmaybe they all use the external antenna to get better signalsorry to say that not what i want
i use to have a motorola walkie talkie
work better that this like x timesorry midland co im not try to destroy your reputation
quality is what we wantno way to set the swr and an operating range of only a couple car lengths made me regret this purchasethis through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as i am only looking for local traffic tieup information of closeby autosthe problem is that it will not stay on the windshieldi am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeksthe first one was put on by professional installers of all my rd party electronics  have dealt with them for years as they do excellent workit fell off and was lost after about  daysthe second one i put on myselfand followed the directions to an exact degreeincluding the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for  minutescleaning the windshield as directed etc etcusing silicon to seal the unit furtherthis one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lostthe third one was supplied to me directly by midland at no charge much to their crediti havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weatheri have my fingers crossedwould i buy this againdefinitely notprobably no through the glass units from anyone else eitherwhich isnt too long
in fact only about  miles or so
after  hours of setting up the adhesive and i am in the adhesives business
it should have been ready to use
driving down the hiway i heard a clatter and clunk and poof gonei see it went from  bucks at amazon to  thru a market place seller
but even for a saw buck it is expensive if it flies off the carto amazons credit they of course took it the remaining parts back
but strike against midland who wasnt there for  miles of my trip due to poor engineering and designunless you are looking for very very short range communication
if you only use the radio for traffic jam info or in a convoy you will not be happy with the performancei got this to avoid the redneck look tuned it  highest and was not getting more than maybe  mile when i tested with a buddy who has a known good rig in his truckput the  toward something better and go with a magnet mount or properly grounded body mount antennamy windows are polarized and from what i understand that can cause issues with these antennas
ive been told that older nonpolarized glass will allow the signal to pass from inside to outside more easily
ymmvi attached the antenna to the rear window on my jeep wrangler and hooked it up to a cobra radio
reception was poor at anything over  yards
transmission was nil
i dont know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that
on a positive note it was very simple to installthis thing does not workif you buy it you will throw it away swrs are always high and can not be set it may look cool but that is all it has going fo iti bought etxec with tripod from the guy in scottsdale he claimed that he never used it
well he lied and this mead telescope was broken it do not turn left or right something with the the gears inside of it i can hear noise of the engines
after research i realized that i cant fix it because its made very flimsy so its unrepairable
mead customers support sad that they dont have parts for it because its discontinued and will not repair it not speaking that it would be costly repair if they had parts wasted
dont buy usedif somebody need telescope with broken ubase and tripod let me knowi read the good reviews and i read the bad ones
more good ones then bad ones so i decided to check this lock out for myselfwell ya got this heavy cable that yes you can cut thru if you have cutters on hand which people that are out to steal your unit have on hand ya got this lock that they say is tamper proof so someone messes with it and now you cant even unlock it tell you get help so you have to leave it cause you got to be somewhere like class or work and now your not in a very good moodnow that i have one of these i am a bit confused
everybody is talking about the cable and the lock and i saw where nobody mentioned the fact that this whole thing is tied to this little t shaped piece of steel that is stuck in this thin piece of either aluminum or plastic and all you have to do is grap it pull up or down on the lock and it pulls right out with little effort
sure laptop is a little damaged but the guy who just stole yours doesnt care one bitas i said in another review how do i know this well i stuck it in my probook s which is the thin aluminum type on the side and when i picked it up wrong and grapped it by the lock the weight of the laptop alone was enough to pull this thing right out and all i had to do is tap the side of the laptop a bit to bend it back and you really cant even tell it was damagedif you want to protect your unit dont walk away from it and as for this lock idea it looks good to those that are not out to steal yours but a joke to those that arethis lock design will slow down a theif about  seconds at the most so if your  seconds away from yours its gonepsthis is the only bad review i have written so keep that in mind if you decide to check this lock thing out with buying onethis lock has a tamperevident feature
if the lock is tampered with the lock goes into lockdown mode and the owners key will not be able to open the lockheres what i was told by kensington tech supportif anyone tries to open the lock without the proper key using an alternate key or a pin etc the lock will go into lockdown mode
the company claims you need to hire a locksmith to open a lock once its in lockdown mode and they will reimburse you up to  of your expensesthis sounds insane to me
the lock should be hard for a thief to open
but i want to be able to open my own lock without professional assistance even if someone tried to tamper with iti got this lock and the quality was great but it didnt fit
the lock was too wide to fit in the kensington lock slot on my macbook pro
it scratched everything up and then i quit trying
dont get this locki purchased the kensington f computer cable and lock because i was familiar with the kensington brand
i have been very disappointed with this product and its use with my hp pavilion dv laptop
the manner in which the key fit into the lock has always been a problem it has always been difficult to fit in and turn to lock it
i have used it about twentyfive times until an internal part broke off rendering it inoperable
this means a product failure in less than a month
i am concluding that the design of the locking mechanism is faulty
it was not a good buyand then it moves erratically or will only go sidewaysdrives me nuts
i will get the expert mouse trackball
wish they had an optic onebleck bleck bleck
dont let this trackball sour you from the concept
trackballs themselves are much better and much easier on your hands wrists and arms then regular mice but this one is a real stinkerfirst off its far too heavy
the ball is mechanical not optical so it makes for slow plodding difficult motions
its a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingerssecondly its just not as comfortable as other similar designed trackballs like the much easier and optical marble mouse by logitech
this one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart
there wasnt any natural quotdrappingquot of the hand on this designthirdly its way overpriced
for ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effortfor those who like this style i highly recommend you opt for the logitech marble mouse
at about  its a much better value
i used one for about five years and noticed a great reduction in wrist painfor those wanting more options such as scroll wheels and such i would suggest the very well designed logitech cordless optical trackman
its what i upgraded to after using the marble mouse for so many years
it does require a slight change in position of hand but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable thumbwheel designs you see you still use your fingers to roll the main ball arounddo yourself a favor and get a trackball
just make sure its an optical one instead of a mechanical one
youll really be thankful you did and youll notice improvement and relief from wristhandarm painive probably invested more than ten hours into getting this thing to work
windows will always open an explorer window on an ati directory every time you start the os and you have to use regedit to put quotes around the multimedia software directory paths
also i had it working for several months until i purchased a digital camcorder
installing the camcorder drivers disabled the tv tuner and no amound of uninstallreinstall could get it to work again
ati support has not been any help
googleing the web and newsgroups has revealed that the ati tv wonder is a nightmare for many peoplethis card may be fine for just watching tv on your pc but for video capturing the quality is horrible
you cannot capture above  pixels heightwise and this severely limits the card in my opinion
i was expecting x capture ability which is present in their much much older product the ati allinwonder over  years old
 but did not find any
add on to that the fact that the mpegmpeg encoding is done through software not hardware and horribly at that the card just isnt worth the price tagperhaps the only good part about this product was that the install went smoothly
well kind of
the package doesnt contain software for windows  you have to go to atis website and download beta softwaredrivers
it takes about  reboots to get the card installed completely in windows  no biggieif you want a decent capture card either get an ati allinwonder radeon or wait for nvidias new quotpersonal cinemaquot to come out supports everything the aiw does plus it has a remote and you can view both tvvga at the same time
i think ill just save up my money and get a sony dv ltgt analog converter box
now thats qualityi have had this unit for a little over a year using it infrequently
it started having problems playing some tracks on even new cds and now it wont play anythingbought  of these thinking theyd be be similar to traditional head cleaning tapes that might play for  minutes before a rewind is required
these dogs run maybe  seconds giving a possible  supposed cleanings before rewind
the cleaning tape doesnt appear any different than video tape and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined
went back to using a  year old cleaning tapethis product is a dog dog dog and stink youll stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeksthis are so useless they dont clean the vcr perfectly and you can clean a vcr yourself for free
the only reason you should use this is if you have one of those tv vcr combos those you cannot clean yourselfterrible product
the older version with the same model number was excellentall this one does is jam in the machineno cleaning video no cleaningbuzzes for a few seconds and jamsi bought  both had exact same problemlike several other reviewers the product ruined the picture
i read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case
there appears to be very poor quality control on these and buyer beware
the product i received destroyed the picture and i am hoping another product will be able to fix the vcraddendum another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripei put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape
i tried again and the same thing happened
i tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened
amazon gave me a full refundi am giving this product a one star review because it did not work for me
i recently purchased theterratec g video digitizer with scart connector usb  pc interface pal ntsc secam video standards for mac  windowsto convert all of my old vhs videos to digital format
this product hooks up to the video out of your vcr interfaces with your computer through usb and records
i no longer have my own vcr so i had to borrow one from a friend
i wanted to use this cleaner to ensure my friends vcr would be in top shape for the conversion
keep in mind that for all intents and purposes i have not touched a vhs or a vhs player practically since dvds became popular
with that said i popped this cleaner in my vcr in about every way i could think of and could not get it to play
i tried to play it rewind it and fast forward and then play it again
the reels would just not spin
luckily the vcr my friend let me borrow was a ridiculously nice unit that was paired with his home theater setup when vhs was still widely used
it just did not need cleaningi seem to remember that some vcrs may have been selfcleaning
i could just be making that up but perhaps this cleaner will not work with a self cleaning vcr
does anyone know anything about thisive had plenty of experience with vcrs over the years inside and out
ive had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs
this thing is a piece of junk and doesnt clean anything
first of all the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for  seconds always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you arenever let ego or testosterone get in the way guysuse a little wisdom
the only problem is there isnt  seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette
it runs for  seconds and stops
second its not good when you place one of these or a tape into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding grinding noise
it happens whenever a tape has wrinkles in it and this thing did exactly that at the beginning each and every time i ran it through i checked the actual tape and nothing looked out of the ordinary
i gave up after a bit to avoid any further problems
after running it a few times it still did not do anything with the simplest of cleaning jobs
i can crack open the case and clean the heads by hand faster than this thingclearly ill be looking for an alternative or simply taking care of the problem by handbottom line uselessi have  of these and neither one works in the  different vcrs i have
they make the screen worse
i then use my old style maxell cleaning tape to fix the picture
how can i get the old style maxell vcr cleaneri put this in my vcr and it turns off the vcr
ive tried everything
it runs vcr tapes fine but when i put the maxell head cleaner cassette in it turns the vcr off
then when i turn the vcr back on it ejects the tapei bought this model because it was cheaper than the sparkplug model in white with an lshaped plug
well the straightness of the plug couldnt withstand normal use and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much
good sound and soundblocking but not durable if you plan to move your mp player in and out of your pocketi wanted to try these because i use my mp player in noisy environments and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise
well i never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn
i tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears but it was never satisfactory
i found them very uncomfortablethese plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use
they are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here
i recommend the sony in earphones about i had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on itand they lasted for  years
these new ones have a straight plug and lasted only  weeks before i had to replace them
if they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again
if you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plugno matter what sale or deal there is or how cheap it is do not buy these earphonesive purchased  headphones that were  times betteri would not want these for free
sound quality is craptheyre comfortable but that really doesnt matter if the sound is horriblesure these headphones have memory foam eat plugs but the back of the earphone has  holes in it allowing sound to pour right  in anyway
this completely nullifies any sound isolation gained by the earplug style ear buds
it provided absolutely no noise cancelation on my plane ride
i had to hold my fingers over the  holes to block out the engine noise pouring in through the back of the ear budthe next problem is in construction
i am a tall guy
the little eat buds are too small for my ears so i use the larger plugs included
they are too long and the plastic tube they fit over is too short
the foam extends well past the plastic support tube allowing the tip of the earbud to be squished closed as it sits in your ear
as a result sometimes you hear nothingfinally the plastic fitting of the ear bud where the foam meats the housing of the ear bud has a rough edge on it
i found it scratching my ear and it eventually caused a small sore after the  hour flight i was onother than that the speakers provide fairly good sound
if it werent for all the other problems id say these were good ear buds
but because of the several flaws i wish it didnt cost so much to ship these back and get a refund
as far as i am concerned i wasted  on thesei just received the plug and gave it a try on my nano
i bought the plug in order to replace the ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym
needless to say i have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them
i shoved them as far as i could up my ear canal up to the point of pain
sound was mediocre at best compared to the stock earphones that came with the ipod
it is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings
standard ipod sets are way betteron the other hand i did not expect anything great due to the price
you mostly get what you pay for
now im waiting for my etymotic eri isolator head set which should hopefully be of better comfort and sound qualitymy advice is to spend a few more dollars in order to get a good seti own a number of different koss sennheiser sony and grado products and i am extremely pleased with them all
i truly believe grado is the best of the four companies but they dont make an inear product
these plugs are good for nothing in my opinion unless one wants to go deaf get a blistering headache and have ringing in the ears
the distortion can only be described as a sonic bass mudslide that overwhelms and perverts all sounds coming through these plugs
i am genuinely shocked that koss would put their name to such a terrible product perhaps these plugs are designed for a younger generation that wants to be deaf by  while listening to the type of boom boom bass that rattles windows
but these plugs are the exact opposite of what an audiophile or anyone else who wants to just listen and hear hisher music books etc
through headphones
before the blistering eight hour headache these plugs had given me was through they were repackaged and shipment was arranged for a refund
ive never been disgusted by a koss product before but i feel that i write out my experience as a warning to others
audiophiles and music lovers bewarein terms of inear headphones i would recommend the updated version of the plug known as the spark plug
it doesnt have as long of a cord but they havent set my teeth on edge or caused headaches such as the one i received from the plug and they do offer some passive noise reduction
i also recommend the sennheiser inear headphones
they are more expensive in the  dollar range but worth it if you have the money because sennheiser does make a better product in my opinion than koss these days
the truth is that sennheiser surpasses koss on almost everything these daysif you dont like inear headphones and im not much of a fan of them myself with a few exceptions and dont want to spend more than  the koss portapro sennheiser px px awesome and blocks sound
 the igrado grado sr the best for pure sound
 sony mdrqlp great little set
and koss ktxpro are excellent alternatives that i believe are truly worth five to ten times what they cost
i hope this was of some helpthese work for some peoples ears and not for others
one reviewer claimed that i must be either retarded or deformed since they dont work for me
that reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venueim going to replace the useless foam others have suggestedfor hunters silencio super sound baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy flents quotquiet pleasequoti believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the koss quotstemquot jeffgood sound isolation too much bass for realistic sound might be ok if you only listen to discovery uncomfortable after about  minutesthese are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever
i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to  have the best sounding headsets for this price rangeafter all the grand reviews i had really high hopes and expectations for these
unfortunately they have all the depth of a  transistor radio
i may have received the lemon pair but who wants to buy them again hoping for a better sounding ear bud
dont waste your time is my advice
find a genuinely well made ear budlet me preface this quick review with the statement that i already own the shure e inear headphones which are well known for their excellent sound quality
i did not purchase the plug with expectations of anything near the experience i have had with the es
the es are not perfect however and ive saved up some gripes for that review as wellin any case i bought the plug as a backup and alternative to my other headphones and i have many
on the new york city subways and city streets isolating headphones are the only way to really hear your music without getting those huge over the ear style headphones
i see everyone with the white ipod style earbuds  can you even hear your music
i swear that i had to turn the volume up all the way to even hear the music over the din of the city streetsso im already a convert to the inear experience
these headphones however are a total bummer
they dont fit in my ear with any of the built in foam inserts
they hurt
the sound is tinny tiny and has no bass whatsoever
i tried every permutation of different foam plugs with no luckim sure the poor sound is entirely because they dont seal in my ear canal well
i looked around on the web  other people are having the same problem and have gone so far as to create their own foam plugs to fit their ears better
unfortunately i dont have the time nor the inclination to bother
so back they goi bought these because my wife has trouble getting regular earbuds to stay put when she goes jogging
for the most part they fit nice but you have to know how to insert them properly
i roll them between my thumb and finger so that they are long as skinny then insert them into my ear and wait for them to expand just like putting in foam earplugs
for me they fit well and seem like theyd stay in better than the rubbertipped earbudsits a shame they sound like a hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can
these are bargain basement earbuds so i certainly wasnt expecting them to sound like sennheiser headphones but i did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my offbrand earbuds that i got for like a dollar and a half on some chinese ahem extreme deal website
they dont
the bass is just nonexistant
for something that isolates the air inside your ear canal bass should be its strong pointthe sound of it is ok but the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal earit worked fine for a few months but now the sound coming out is really fuzzy in other words its ready for the garbage hold on ok it is now in the garbage can
btw i never moved this around at allgood thing i waited to review thisall i wanted was a simple slider device to adjust volume so i wouldnt have to keep pulling the ipod out of my pocket at starbucks to adjust the volume on the unit
mostly this has very little ability to increase sound very good at lowering the sound
i guess that makes sense if i turn up the ipod volume to the max then i turn the koss down to get to the level i want it works ok actually i wanted something more like my sennheisers where i can adjust the volume either way
another waste of my funds too inexpensive to return too useless to keep you can buy this one at the goodwill store next weekwhen i plugged in my stereo headphones i got nothing
i found i had to pull the plug out about half way and jiggle it around to make any contact
then i got mono sound
think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture
got a different brand elsewhere that works finekoss should change the name of this unit to the clarity eliminator
that is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down
all the clarity  treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound
i tried it with brand new koss ur headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a tdk dual tape deck
by themselves the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud
add the vc and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control totally useless
if you need a volume control for headphones do not buy this one
either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control such as the koss uri have discovered as have others that most modern tvs do not have a simple output jack for headphones
instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks
the sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remotes volume controls i guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system which is not what i wanted to do
so i heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing i needed to boost volume
wrong
it has no power source so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the tv output jacks
all it can do in reality is turn the sound down
skip itthe volume control dial is way too small and ina depressed area making it hard to use
also it seemed to have trouble controlling the volume as rds of the dial did nothing and all the volume control was in the last rdthis koss vc in line volume control which i ordered along with a set of koss headphones from the same seller were terriblein my opinion
first offthe volume control know is so inset and tiny that i coulnt even identify it at first for about  mminutes
its difficult to thumbnail this volume control to raise and lower the volume
also i was unable to mute out the soundi felt that the range of volume was inferior that it afforded me the opportunity to listen to
i did follow instructions about where to put the sources volume such as mid to just above middle rangei bought this volume control for sports activities
big mistake it lasted for less than three months the cable connection to the volume control is broken
the potentiometer that adjusts the volume is a piece of crap too
dont buy this product for sports useonly worked for a short time about   mouths then one side or the other on the headphones kept going off i had to keep playing with it to get it to somewhat work   i got  of these and the same thing keeps happening
it is very hard to find a good volume controli got it because of the l shaped plug in but when it got here it was just the old plain straight plug inafter less than a month of being attached to my laptop the volume control started introducing static and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down no matter what i did with the volume wheelseriously are these airplane headphones
thats how poor i found the sound quality in these
i was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself wow what a let down
they do look cool but even the  skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these
i cannot believe this is koss i have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sadthe gold plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices
i bought two of these puppies and they are both defective
the problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours weeksreally though
maybe its because ive listened to much better before
if you use the sennheiser cx this will sound like crapno sound isolation i already knew that but i thought everything else would make up for it
theres like no bass barely any
the volume sucks has to be louderat first after reading all these awesome reviews i thought i was going crazy
but i plugged them into my computer my mp my ipod my stereo system
theyre horriblei expected this most over the head earphones have leather cups these had foam
they make your ears hot
and they exhibit horrible sound
oh man returned these the next day
have to pay shipping costs
dont buy these
please
worth like  bucksand they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch themsound quality decent
comfort not good but bearable
travel durability abysmal
like i went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame
i had a pair of sonys that i owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem
eventually the cord got frayed and i had to replace it with this piece of garbage
maybe i just had bad luck
probably not though
on my flight back sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which doesnt work with my crusty former marine mentality i turned that row into a warzone with that idiot and a neurotic aged woody allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and couldnt shut up i reached for my trusty noise killers
only to discover to my horror that the cheap pos
had broken
if somebodys little damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearablei used the sennheiser px headphones very similar in size price and style almost daily for  years when one side crapped out
drat
so i bought the koss portapros as a replacement
the koss are not as attractive
not that important to me
the koss are not as comfortable
the metal head band is cheesy when compared to the sennheisers and they are only  more
the koss are also a tad too tight
my ears burned even when on the loosest setting after about  hours
the big problem and i toyed around with equalizer settings in winamp my mp player software of choice is that the koss are incredibly easy to overdrive even at relatively low listening levels
not so the sennheiser headphones
had i noticed distortion with them i would have chucked them long agosummary if you want a light pair of onear portable headphones spend the extra  and get the sennheiser px or higher models
the koss may be adequate for portable mp devices where you cannot adjust the eq settings but for more ambitious use they are far too inadequate
im buying another pair of the sennheisersi was reasonably happy with the sound and comfort but after a year of use theres a loose connection near the plug that makes one channel cut out
im really sick and tired of the disposable nature of every pair of headphones i buya relative got this model koss as a gift and absolutely loved them but finally the thin cord broke loose so he purchased another pair and sent them back because the ones being sold now are not the same ones as he got before and are so cheap and flimsily made that he knew they would not last
the cord for one thing is a lot more flimsy and thin and there is more plasticthe photograph is showing the old model koss and does not depict the newer version of this same model which is not made as well and was quite a shock when he got thempurchased these june   i was tired of my son breaking my expensive headphones and decided to try these as they looked industrial strength
they do the job and didnt cost that much
you will have to adjust the equalizer settings on your pc or whatever you use these for as they dont seem to be quite right with the neutral settings of most devices
i like the wire on one side only but i dont care for the constant adjusting that is required they seem to reset to shorter way more easily when i set them down than when i try to lengthen them when putting them on
i also dont care for the bulkiness it would seem that they would be somewhat noise canceling just by the size but no such luck
for the money though they work as well as could be expectedupdate august   so much for durability used them today and they broke
the size adjustment things on the head band broke
i am careful with my usage of anything i buy and am very disappointed with only  months of use
a close look at the adjustment fittings show that they are of low quality
definitely will never buy koss againi bought these for my daughter for christmas
they broke about  weeks ago
only one speaker works
they were sent off to the landfill soon after
i wouldnt buy them againmy girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a suddeni know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product
perhaps it works for them but i hate it
this set of headphones is already in the garbage
why
the sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be
i have other headphones with much better sound but that is not the primary reason that i dumped them
the wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place  in front of the earcoverings so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod
i would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way
also i like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt
the wires on these headphones are too short for this and with the wireplacement the wires cut across my neck when i tried wearing them this way
i have purchased two koss products
ive been disappointed with both
there will not be a thirdworked and sounded pretty good for a few months then the sound became distorted and every bit of bass was missing
i am now shopping for a quality replacement for themvery disappointed in kossthis product does not work
i purchased this product to replace a faulting adc  equalizer
this was the only choice on the market
after getting the unit i was able to connect it quite simple in to my system
i have a dbx unit for my reel to reel and had to connect it directly to the reel to reel not much of a problem
but then the problem started to unfold
first the buttons they are confusing and dont work half the time
then i noticed that i could not monitor tape recording output from three head deck and dbx record monitoring
with the eq connected to a deck that monitors it seem to short the input to the output causing the input level control not to respond not distortion but not good for you tape deck
after that i started tested a different configurations
i have a  head deck so i connected it to the eq  and it worked okay but still had problems with the buttons happened again
i then connected the reel to reel without dbx direct bypass the monitor loop and it worked okay for the first few times then all of a sudden i could not record on the reel to reel the input controls didnot work and the signal to the meters were pegged not good then i losted the  head deck
powered off everything and tried again
after several reset everything worked again
so i decided to give this unit one more try by adding one piece at a time and testing one piece one piece at a time
i added the three head deck teac v to tape then tested worked okay for a while and then things started not working
remember this is just  tape deck 
connected
powered off all components and things went back to working
i said okay maybe it is me let me read the manual more closely
figured out the button tape tapelt button depends on the setting of the audiovideo button and also the linetape button so to listen to tape deck  you must have tape  audiovideo  linetape led green
okay that worked only for about and hour and then same problem happen input controls stop working and meter pegged and again this is just  tape deck connected 
what i have found out after opening the unit and putting it on a oscilloscope i found that the contacts in the switches are very poorly made and are solider to close together and are causing electrical interference
when a button is depressed and testing the contacts on the oscilloscope showed a little ambient noise dbm level which is okay but as you use the switch the noise level increases until it shorts that is why when you power off and let the unit sit and power back on it works okay that is kind of a electrical discharge so to speak and the ambient noise is back to around   dbm
the open circuit test fluctuated from inf to k ohm resistance
closed circuit test revealed from    ohm resistance on average but fluctuated to inf at times
that why the sound cuts out and the input shorts to the outputso all in all the unit went back for a refund
please dont buy this unit
it is low quality and poor craftsmanship that it will not last more than a month or so
it does not support tape monitoring and dont try to connect a three head deck it will short out your deck
the buttons dont work and short constantly
tape to tape dubbing is limited to only monitoring source that is correct when dubbing you can only list to the source tape and not the dubbing tape to insure that the deck is recording okay
this is a very poor designi read another review on here complaining about the sticky buttons on the audio source eq  after reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems i decided to take a chance hoping that the other reviewers button problem was an isolated incident
wishful thinking
ive had the eq  for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine
i was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out
at first i thought it might be a loose cable or worse a problem with the cartridge on my turntable
then i remembered the review about the sticky buttons
sure enough i went to the eq and jiggled the buttons and the sound cut in and out as i did so
after jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while then it out of nowhere started acting up again
its not so much that they stick as it is that they just plain dont work properly
the have a cheap feel to them all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket
when you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move
besides the fact they dont work they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted
they dont let you monitor the tape decks output when recording something that should be a standard feature of an eq
the buttons on my old radio shackoptimus eq made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbingmonitoring
there are a couple other annoyances on the audio source too
the analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment when i play my cd player the display is just maxed out
you can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs but i only want to turn down the display not the volume
the  line on the eq should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders but it is simply white like all the lines which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line
if i were keeping the unit i would take care of this problem with a magic marker
there are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced
the sound quality seems decent when it works but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while youre listening to your music
the illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat but hey i dont buy a stereo component just for looks
seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue im sure audio source has to be aware of the problem
obviously they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer
its too bad since this model seems to be pretty much the only eq left on the market for a home stereo
the only other eq i found other than professional models for rackmount systems was a teac model which doesnt have as many inputs as the audio source
i am returning the audio source for a full refund no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect
i guess i will try my luck with the teac either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an eq
i will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if i want to do any dubbing with the teachad this and now have an art  eq for 
no comparison
art is actually djreal quality with unbalanced rca jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro useultraquiet high quality potentiometers discrete channels with output control clipping indicators  or  db scale select for each channel
ground lift select for possible source grounding problemsjust need to buy  rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting rather than rack mounting
comes without feet and rack ears for  rack
much nicer eq than this audio source junk and ive owned botheven if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality you will probably have headaches installing the drivers
i gave up on their mouse years ago and i suggest avoiding this product as well
i got it as a gift and i found that with respect to camera software and overall quality this product is a losertotal junk
installer shut down forcing a manual installation
image is grainy regardless of settings colors arent right
horrible avoidlike most websites ive looked for these headphones on theyre showing you the picture of the now discontinued mdrv but if you look closely at the model number below its the cheaper mdrvhd
dont be fooledperhaps im just used to real studio headphones but these dont even sound as good as my in ear monitors
id like to give them a break for only being  but considering the fact that these are practically unusable without a high boost and mid cut eq its hard to justify the purchase
i just do not know why these lack so much high end and boost the k frequencies so much
after cutting these frequencies in itunes they dont sound bad but you shouldnt have to run an eq to get a decent sound
only thing i like about these is the inline volume controldo yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a higher end model
youll be happy you didlike other reviews the swivel points for the ear cups are plastic and will eventually break
mine did
buyers remorse scale   being worstdont waste your moneyafter owning these headphones for over  months i can tell you that they just dont compare at all to the sony mdrv model
the overall sound quality is muddy flat and lifeless
the bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper midbass rather than a smooth tight and deep bass
the midrange sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound
highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise
if youre buying these mainly to listen to music id suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad
i currently use the sony vs not the vs for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramaticthe build quality and comfort of the sony mdrv is about all that is good about them
but if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic sony mdrv model many studios and radio stations use the sony mdrv or the sony mdr headphones for monitoring sound
they fold up just like the mdrvs and are just as comfortableif sound quality is important to you then avoid the sony mdrv headphones like the plague
theyre horriblefrom the start had to fiddle with plug to get good soundat first i thought it was the computer jack but as timewent on it got worse and worse
did some experimentingand determined it was definitely loose wiring in the plugyou spend this kind of money you at least expect it to bemanufactured well
im done with sony
ive had other badexperiences recently they just arent what they used to bethese are not the real deal
they are fakes
the so called mm diaphragm dont sound good at all
ive had a real pair of vs and they sound  better than thesedo not waste your time or money on this producti work from home and use my home phone at least  to  hours a day
i have panasonic and have used panasonic headsets previously
after i cycled through two of them i decided to give this one a try
i just got it in the mail and it has  mm jack
my home phone takes mm jack
there is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so i relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone
i also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter  to  mm
i did not get that so this is useless for mei will be contacting the vendor for a return
disappointingi paid a little more for these than another pair thinking the plantronics brand and the boom would enhance sound quality for those i talk to
actually ive been told the sound of my voice is slightly less clear than the piece i had been using at half the price
so would not recommendmade it to the junk tech drawer
not worth the cost of return
not really the worth of completing the minimum word number for the review
generally i dont pan a product but tested this on two phones
keep lookingi use a headset every day
the first one stopped working within a month got it replaced i have to pay for the return shipping and the second one stopped working in a week still have to put a warranty claim in
decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchased the plantronics hwn binaural headset with the plantronics straight cable  quick disconnect to  mm plugawkward to use and the pieces  were difficult to put together the padded ear cushion would not go on  and no instructions were provided
uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth
will keep trying to find a good plugin headset for my iphone as an alternate to bluetooth
my biggest problem was that it wasnt clear from the description that i had to also order the    adapter in order for the plug to work with my iphone   went all over trying to find such an item to no avail even best buy didnt carry anything
trying to return iti have used these headphones before and i must say they are excellent comfortable and clamp like they are gonna break your skull
how ever upon ordering my own pair of these i was swindled by this dealer httpwwwamazoncomgpbrowsehtmlieutfmarketplaceidatvpdkikxdermeaspbddmar  aka yourdealdo not buy them from this store they are counterfeit reproductions they are very well made counterfeits but the head band is to thick the cups are plastic versus metal and the over all build quality is down the tubes
do your self a favor and find a reputable dealerafter many headphones i found these and they sound wonderful
the frequency response of  hz   khz
unless you are going to spend many hundreds more for studio monitor headphones dont hesitate purchasing these
if purchasing for a very discerning ear these sound as good or better than the bose line that costs twice as muchbottom line is  these do not suck
but months later now it has a buzz in the right ear and i am fedpiece of crap the ear pads keep coming off
i should have just bought the beats headphones by dr dre insteadthese headphones lasted  years total
the included muffs only lasted  year before they started slipping off very often and flaking
i bought a replacement for  and i thought i would be good
all of a sudden the left speaker stopped working  years after the purchase date
im not wasting my time with any more sony trash
save yourself some time and go with a better brandyou sent me the wrong item
the item you sent me was suppose to go to mr feliz  birdi
wroong itemi really dont know what your going to dotitle says it all
these are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke
look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one hashttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbmteqmrefohosidetailsthis is the cable i went to and it rocked
worked perfect for reasonable price
youll be glad you read this post
god blesssub standard cables not the belkin quality i have come to expect
it took almost  weeks to get them and now that i have tried both of the cables i am not impressed with the quality of the product or the shipper
a consistent connection is iffy at best not like the other cables that i currently have so the problem is not with my system it is with the cables
when i finally received them the plastic package had yellowed
so these units were either old or had been exposed to sunlight for a long period of time
save your time and money order them from somebody elsei almost bought it but checked the speed right before i hit the purchase buttonthe  mbit speed means it is usb   that is about  of the speed of usb it will not work in many applications
you can get a good usb  cable for the same priceusb cable was dead on arrival
not cool considering i ran it through a walltodays lesson test your cords before running themmy flip video ultra series camcorder wouldnt connect using this cable
i purchased a flip video ultra series camcorder along with this belkin fu usb extension cable
my computer dell running xp pro wouldnt recognize the usb device flip ultra using this cable
the flip connected immediately when plugged directly into the usb portbelkin is a reputable supplier but this cable got just  star for my applicationamazon list this as in stock i placed order  and used nd day shipping its  and just shipped amazon upgraded shipping to next day big help when it takes a week and a half to get orderi am usually very details aware but i also did not realize that this was oldschool usb  and not usb  capablewhile im sure the cable works fine be careful about what you need it fori too thought i was buying a usb cable that i could connect two computers
i believed this because it is an aa extension cable
indeed the key word is extension
normally aa would mean the same type of connector but not in this caseitem received was not belkin branded
cable also did not work all items show up as not recognizedthis seller needs to be investigated
the seller is purposefully ordering fake cables and selling them as name brand with the name brand price to booti can understand this happening once but with so many complaints about the same issue and me getting the same issue this seller is clearly engaging in false advertising and judging by how far this goes back they most likely know about it and choose to do nothing about it
seems amazon does not list the most recent reviews under the product descriptionthe cable i received is not a belkin cable
it is a cheap no name cable
the picture is of a gray cable with the belkin name molded in the plastic ends
i received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker
it was sold by marginmart inc and fulfilled by amazon
i feel i was lied to and ripped offthe cable arrived today and i was surprised to find that it is an oldstandard usb  extension cable
thats why so many other reviewers found that it didnt work with their devices since most current devices need usb  spec cables
i elected to return my cable to amazon for a refund
they said no need to return it theyll just give the refundmoral if a usb cable does not explicitly state that it is usb  or usb  then its probably a usb  cable that wont support most of todays peripheralsnote i knew this already but people should take note that a usb extension cable can only be used together with another usb cable to extend the length of the connection
its not suitable for directly connecting a device to your computer without that normal cablei used a ft usb extension cable that came with my device it worked perfectlyi used this ft usb extension cable from belkin the computer said there was a problem with my usb device every time i tried to connect itmoral of the story this cable from belkin does not function properly
dont buy itit doesnt say anywhere in the listing that i could find that this isnt usb   my mistake for just assuming it was i guess
still i think they should make it obvious that it isnt  since thats pretty much the standard todayi have bought many small radios over the years including others by sangean
i was very disappointed with this one
it looks cheap feels cheap and has mediocre sound
for the price i was expecting better
i know i could have bought a much nicer radio for less moneyi would have given this  stars but that didnt appear to be an option on the amazoncom form
after seeking through the entire sw band three different times at different times of the day and night all i got was  bbc and that only once and some religious broadcasts
i would have been  very happy to get stations from just canada and mexico but no such luck
its a very nice amfm radio with some spiffy features like a sleep timer  but my hope was to receive international broadcasts and i am returning it  because it simply did not do thati got this radio november th and am not pleased
the reception isnt that great and the fm
has too much override where you hear the same station on adjacent frequencies
unless its a very strong station you have to tune away from the nearby station to get anything
sangean couldve done betteri had this radio for  months before it stopped working
it is made very cheaply and does not justify its price
the battery cover in the back kept falling from the day one nothing was broken just sign of poor quality control and fit and finish
it ended up in trash somewhere
will not buy sangean brandi could not get this thing to work
tried it on windows xp  and se
windows simply will not recognize this device
i work in a tech support center and have fairly indepth technical skills
ive also had other technically adept people look at it with same results
ill try belkin or linksys now but id steer clear of this itemthis antenna did not work at all
the only good thing i can say is that is was cheap enough that i didnt go to the bother of sending it back just into the trashthis drive failed after  months use
im rmaing it now as its under warranty but just lost a ton of data
apparently this model has many issues that cause it to fail both hardware design and firmware
definitely not a good combinationthanks a lot seagate you just lost all my future businessim in the it industry and have had installed swaped formated hundreds of hard drives in my life
hard drive failure is normal and its expected
what ive found out is that mtbf that manufacturers publish has very little correlation with reality since reality is affected by factors such as temperature handling etc
what they publish is in a perfect laboratory environment not what people normally have at home
in my past i have used seagate maxtor western digital and hitachi
seagate has alway been high on my list because of their reliability and their  year warrantypersonally reliability is a huge concern for me because i take tons of precious pictures of my family  baby and i cannot afford to lose them
thats why i always build raid systems with different drives from different manufacturers and in certain cases same manufacturer but with very different batches
after only  weeks this drive failed
since it was on a raid system no big deal
i swapped in another drive and it to amazon
my other g failed after a years use
thats  seagate failures within  days of timespan not a good impression so farlets compare the latest seagate with the latest western digital technologies
my green t wd drives have been running for a few months without any problems so far
its by far the quietest drives ive ever gotten certainly much quieter than any of the seagate barracuda drives
its also the most vibration free drives seagate is a bit noisier and cool running heat shortens the lifespan of everything
the return policy for wd is much more hastle free you put in your credit card number and theyll hold the fees and mail you a new drive immediately until you return the defective one upon which theyll refund the credit card fees
compare that to seagates return policy where they want to charge you a set amount of cost if you want them to send you a replacement while you still have the defective driveseagate used to be well known for its quality in the early s
i used to trust them exclusively but throughout the years their quality has decreased tremendously and i no longer recommend using them
it happened to maxtor in the early days when megabytes were a lot maxtor drives were notoriously bad in the s
i guess every good successful company in their quest to drive up more and more profits take shortcuts to make more money and eventually shoot them in the footguess what slashdot has a headline seagate hard drive fiasco grows
ha
i am not surprised
sorry but seagate is just not living up to its reputations anymore
your  year warranty is useless when you cant recover precious data such as pictures of your familybaby
regardless of how good a manufacturer is i cannot emphasize how important it is to  building raid or at minimum do thorough backups every once in a while
youll be protecting hundreds of manhours for your corporation if this is for corporate use and hundreds of tears for your family for family usemy stas bricked itself today after  months
seems like the firmware problem
it would be useful if seagate would proactively notify users about such danerous bugs in the firmware
also if the drive is an oem drive seagate will not repair it nondestructively  even if the problem is due to the faulty firmware
if you buy a seagate it may be prudent to wait a few months to make sure that model is stable since so many of their newer drives seems to be having firmeware and related issuessearch the seagate community forum on this one
it will simply disappear from your bios at ramdom intervals and give you the blue screen of death
i fixed all my pc problems by replacing this drivedont waste your time and money on this oneafter purchasing this drive to use in an external case for backing up my computer i had reoccurring problems with the drive
i tried different cases different operating systems and even installing the drive in a desktop computer
no luck
after contacting seagate and explaining to them the issues with the drive they refused to give me a firmware update which seems to be the fix for the problem according to pages and pages of forum reviews
they said since i used it in an external case it voided the warranty
after reviewing the warranty this is untruenow i am out of money
i did purchase toshiba drives for my ps laptop and desktop as well as the external case i originally used for this seagate drive
all are working wonderfully
buyer beware seagate has really fallen off as far as reliable products go
i would insult their customer service but if you have ever had the torture of using their website and bureaucracy you already know contacting seagate is like pulling your own teeth in front of a live studio audienceid completely skip the seagate lineup
run
seriouslyi had three seagate drives fail the next replaced its predecessor in about a years time
if youre wondering i work at a university and were encouraged to buy through purchase orders locally
and that meant seagateso three drives failed
yes that counts as a statistical anomaly
it deserves a fine googling
some people tried to tell me my computer case didnt have the proper air flow or that my external casings power supply hurt the drive
nuh uh on each accountother people pointed me out to a firmware problem with a large group of seagate drives
the drives can enter a limbo bsy state that bricks the drive even though physically there is nothing wrong with it
it can be cured with a very technical lowlevel serial com with the controller board
which i actually did for kicks
its kind of cool
seagate acknowledges the problem
they have a serial number search
armchair quarterbacks estimate the failure is on  of their lineup
not sure
wouldnt take the chance
they wont fix oem drives
they will do the low level repair thing for retail drives if your serial number comes up in their search pagethis kind of mass failure of hard disks happened once before oddly enough
it was with hitachiibms deskstar lineup properly monikered deathstar
google it if youd like
but anyway for the time being run away
run awaydied in less than  months
i brought this from amazoncom
now i have contacted seagate for warranty purpose
they said i need to ship the item at my expense and wait for  weeks for replacement probably another rectifiedrefurbished brick
not worthy total waste of time and moneyanother chinese garbageim surprised more people have not posted about what a disaster this product is with many many early failures
there is a very long and heated thread on seagate forumsmine  installed  nov  died  jan  with about  hours of video files i had copied from family camcorder tapes at xtoo bad to see a company that used to have a fine reputation going down the toiletel producto arriboacute sin problemas una semana despueacutes sorporesa el disco murioacute contacto seagate y enviacuteo el disco de regreso recibo un segundo disco y sorpresa el disco veniacutea defectuoso y de paso dantildeoacute la fuente de alimentacioacuten de mi pc nuevamente contacto a seagate y enviacuteo el disco el tercer disco fue recibido en buen estado y continua funcionando sin embargo el haber elegido a seagate me costoacute  en enviacuteos adicionales y  en la reposicioacuten de la fuente que su disco dantildeoacute mientras esperaba alguacuten dia recibir el disco de reposicioacuten que funcionara adquiriacute un disco hitachi de tb que desde su llegada ha funcionado a la perfeccioacuteni used this dive for backups and after two backups it completely failed
seagate should be sued forselling total junk to the public i dont know how they get away with selling this junki purchased three gb versions of these back at the beginning of  for a system build where i used two in a raid configuration and the third drive as a back up
just  months later all three drives are failing each has a smart problem detected by windows and by seagate seatools and two of the three also fail seatools short drive tests
i use these drives in an extremely well ventilated antec p case that has a separate hard drive bay that keeps them isolated from the heat produced by the motherboard and graphics card so heat is not the reason these drives are failing
i believe the real issue is with poor quality components
i use a fair number of other seagate drives and have had no problems with them
i bought literally about a dozen  rpm drives for upgrading various notebooks mac and pc without any issuesfor a while i was replacing all my friends drives after i sped my macbook  drive up from rpm to rpm and was showing everyone the performance improvements in any case the problems ive had with these drives seem to be an issue limited to this particular versionthe only positive thing i can say is that at least i learned these drives were going bad before they completely died
i was able to back up all my data to my nes array
ive filled out rmas through the seagate webpage and will hopefully get replacement drives soon but i dont know that ill actually trust them considering my  fail rate with the three i already own
i may decide to replace them with wd drives insteadnot much to say
it was good while it lasted
vista began acting weird until it wouldnt boot anymore
luckily i have two more hard drives a  gb seagate and a  gb western digital  i kept this one from the first computer i ever bought like  years ago and it still works
ive been reading a lot of negative reviews about seagate hard drives and with my experience i will not buy another seagate drive ever againworst drives ever
had  fail already none due to excessive heat or impact
the wd drives i purchased at the same time are still going strong
buy what youd like but im sticking with wdmodel stas product number pbx firware sd date code   worked great for about  months and then with no warning grinding noises etc
of imminent failure i turned my computer off on a thursday night and friday morning the bios would not recognize my hdd
i just got the no boot device available press enter key to retry
i then purchased a copy of spinrite  hoping to just recover my data
spinrite only recognized the a drive that the floppy was in
i even tried an external hdd enclosure with another computer but that didnt work eitherthree weeks earlier i had sold after cleaning and formating a seagate freeagent pro  gb external hard drive because my son had given me a new wd my passport essential se external hard drive
as i am typing this review i am looking at that factory sealed package and just shaking my headi wish that i had know of the firmware update fromm  to   that may have helpedseagate is replacing my hdd under warranty but years of information pictures less what has been saved to dvds and records are lost
that is my fault for not backing up on a regular basis and i can live with that but if there was a known problem with these drives then i feel that seagate should have let all registerd users know of the firmware update hence my one star rating
there must be a reason that they have cut short their warranty period from five years to threeit bricked right around the six month mark
my bios wont even recognize that it exists anymore
ive switched sata cables and power plugs and tried it in a completely different machine and it still isnt recognized and so im reasonably certain that it just plain failed
i am a complete backup fanatic and it is still under warranty so this is nothing more than a slight hassle for me personally but bewaremine has finally quit being detected after  months of use
during that time it has disappeared several times daily
now it doesnt show up in the bios
i have four of these drives in raid  using a ware se
luckily the ware card is very smart and i am still able to use my computer
even when it is working this raid unit with these drives was slower than it should be
so now i need to buy  more drives and rebuild my systeminstalled this drive to upgrade a gb hd on a relatives computer
in less than a week stated to get hard drive failure is imminent messages
ran the seagate diagostic software and the drive did not pass
currently am waiting for a replacement drive from seagate
luckily still had the original gb drive that i had cloned from and was able to reinstall it
it is a shame that a brand new drive would not last more than a week
an internet search shows that there has been a high failure rate for this model of hdseagate is knowingly selling a faulty hard drive that just up and decides to not be seen by the computer one day
you will lose everything on it
no it does not stop working you can hear it spinning and there is no warning to this happening
when you contact them they try to charge you  or more to retrieve your data for youthese hard drives are absolute garbagei had one for  year and  weeks that bricked up
 weeks past the warranty
i would not be as ticked off if this was not a known issue with these things
just google barracuda bricked hard drive or tick tick tick significant number of seagate hard drives failingthe company has a wonderful  program to get you your data back greati just went out and bought a western digital which i would highly recommend over seagate crapi have had two of these die on me and have had to backup all of my data and move to new drives
this is unacceptable
it takes a good day to transfer all of your stuff to a new drive reload windows reinstall all software etc
these drives are crapi have owned three of these drives now and all three have failed in a matter of months
thankfully ive been using them as one disk in a raid so i havent lost any data yet but this failure rate is unacceptable
meanwhile the western digital drives in my raid have been chugging along for over  years without issue
do not buy these seagate drives unless you want to lose datastay away look for updates in other reviews for failurespros works fine until it diescons i have had  failures of this model disk in the last  days in  different systems
these were not gamer systems and are well cooled in large antec boxes
clearly seagate has a problem and expect additional failures  next time i will put the service  shipping charges towards western digital units rather than replacing junk with junkcons  died without any warning after two monthsthe return policy is horrible  you are literally not allowed to use packing peanuts bubble wrap or newspaper to package a dead drive when you return it for warranty replacement
it has to be  inches of foam rubber in a corugated box or your warranty is voidalso you are sent a refurbished drive as a replacementyou are also required to pay for shipping the drive back and can wait as long as  days from the day they receive it to get your new onethis last point isnt too bad in itself but when mixed with everything else its stupidoh and the rma form on the website was down for two or three days before i could actually get it sent in
customer service couldnt even fill out an rma request for me  the entire system was down for maintenancethey also make sure to withhold the detail about packing until you already submitted the form and possibly gave them  to avoid waiting a month for your replacemeother thoughts what happened seagate
i have two more of the older  drives in here and theyve run absolutely beautifully for the year ive had them  as a matter of fact theyre the only thing holding my degraded raid up right now
i still have the old gb drive that came with my dell five years back and it still works like a charm
i order a couple  drives one arrives doa and the other dies within two months without any warningcons had a sd failure
drive was making a highpitched noise just before it failed on machine reboot
was able with effort to get sda flashed onto drive
but then drive became very noisy  every few seconds it would sound like the head was tracking accross the drive a farting noise as some have said
performance would also drop to near zero at these timesgot a warranty replacement from seagate which cost me   another drive with sd
sure enough one week after install this one just started to make the highpitched noise so im typing this before im computerless once againother thoughts i will never ever buy seagate again
i will do everything i can to make sure no one i know buys their products either
shame shame shame on you seagateall versions of this drive manufactured prior to jan  may be affected by a serious firmware bug
a firmware update has been released but according to multiple reports the update may brick this drive
i would recommend staying away from this model until the affected drives are out of the supply chainwe have purchased dozens of these drives between  and over half have died
 out of   one hard drive to stayfar far away
the  that died just bricked out
badfirmware etc
its amazing how seagate has yet to be suedfor issuing so many dead drives
well they are paying theprice as their competitors are catching up with themguaranteed  seagate will not have the title of bestselling hard drive maker after daniel j tyler  the wjgdespite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product i thought id give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor
i should have listenedand you should too
the converter is worthless but if youre wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it but id look elsewhere
after merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped smoked and was no longer effectiveor rather was never affectivei bought this for my gf to use with a  watt hair straightening iron in europe
we made sure the switch was on the low wattage setting and within minutes it started smelling like burned plastic
but it worked
the second time she used it not only did the converter burn out but her  hair straightener burned out as well
and we made sure it was on the  watt setting
by the way the same wall outlet worked for all of my universal devices  voltage like my ipod blackberry and camera chargers with no problem  so the problem was clearly isolated to this converterit seems to be a manufacturing issue that some people who buy this get good converters while others get faulty ones
but is it worth spending money on this only to have it either not work or even burn out your devicethe only redeeming thing about this is that you get the attachments along with the converter
the outlets in europe are inset in the wall
so even though the converter plugs are the proper shape it is not long enough to reach the inset outlet
but it is with the attachmentsbe very careful on type of devices you plan on using overseas even when  plugged into a voltage converter
while theoretically the converter reduces voltage from v to v my daughters hair straightener overheated and melted the adhesive holding the heating elements so the straightener was ruined
my only thought was that hz frequency of the power overseas could cause greater current draw for heating devices such as hair dryers coffee pots straighteners
the voltage converter cannot modify frequency from  hz to  hz
most battery charging devices for laptops cellphones camera battery packs operate on   hz and will not need the converter but you will need the plug adapter for the wall outlet
look at the rating label on each device to confirmmy wife recently traveled to germany with this unfortunate converter choice
it failed to operate
i caught several of the other reviews on this item that also indicated instant or premature death
think there might be a trend
i can not recommendthey dont mention is clearly enough that this is not a gigabit switch waste of my money since i missed the  day return window
it sat in the box for over a month since the project was delayedthe power connector on my fs is very sensitive  try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection
my friend reports the same problems with his
mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as i purchase a replacement  not another netgear
a shame it is otherwise a nice switchbought my first fs on  from amazon
it died several days later
that time amazon replaced it including return postage on 
ok i expect a dud once in awhile
however this morning  less than  months later the replacement died
completely
disappointed in the netgear brand
please be aware that in keeping with the instructions it is not in direct sunlight not near a heater or heat source and is in an open area where it gets plenty of ventilation and is climate controlled
it sits flat on a table nothing on top or under it to heat up
so i cant think of anything that i have done to cause the problem
it was good while it lasted
i didnt overwork it i simply wanted to connect my laptop and my desktop to my dsl ethernet connection
the laptop is always connected the desktop only occasionally
last night it was working fine this morning nada
amazons solution is for me to pay return postage and they will issue a partial refund in an unnamed amount
i suspect that the partial refund wont even cover the cost of return postage
guess some days it just doesnt pay to get out of bed
i sent email feedback to netgear since they dont provide any other options on their website
their web forms would not accept a phone call or support dont know why
i dont have high hopes for any assistance from them
just wanted to let potential buyers aware of my bad experience
lots of folks seem happy with this product but i wonder how many of them will feel the same after  months or a year
good luck everyoneupdate    i emailed netgear about a week ago and explained what happened with their product asking what recourse i had
i got seven
emails back stating that they had received my email andor it was referred to such and such a department for handling
then i got one expressing sorrow that my claim had been handled badly gee i didnt see that they had handled it at all
and would i fill out a survey so they could improve for their customers
what about helping this one
the seventh email was a reminder to fill out the survey
give me a break
guess i just have to laugh
draw your own conclusionsthe switch worked initially but a fatal problem developed within hours
on one of the ports both lights lit continuously even with no plug in the port and nothing connected to it on any port could communicate through it
there is nothing to configure fix or tweak
it doesnt even have an onoff switch it either works or it doesntlike most netgear products the unit is built on the outside like a tank and has the appearance of durability but of course what counts is on the inside
after replacing it with another model i was back in businessit lasted only  months thats pretty bad for a routerswitch
see if i can get a refund for it
my dlink lasted  yrsworked for a few days then died
i think the power supply was the weak link
should be a highly reliable product  i am surprisedjunk only one ethernet port worked
tech support sucked
will stay away from net gear
purchased a china model for  cheaper and it works greatthis is the worst light i have ever owned never worked and when it did stay lit it would leave me in the dark
the only reason i did not return it was i needed it to pass an electrical inspectioni bought  and both stop working within  months
moisture got into the cheap plastic sensor housing and shorted out
i should have spent the extra money and got a better built unitthe mounting holes of this light are  degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box
it is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drillingpros uses less batteries than the space shuttle  aasgreat idea gone to h quickly due to lack of product support
apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from attention deficit disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful complete line of tapes

tivo is great but the customer service experience was awful
tivo tried to handle the problem by not letting us talk with phillips directly
claimed they lost the unit lost the credit card credit card was expired it wasnt etc
it was like the dog ate my homework excuse everytime and then they said it was  hrs before they could get us an update
 months later we finally had our unit back friday but by sunday the tivo service shutdown because the serial number was unknown to the computer
had to wait until monday to fix it
buy sony insteadwithin a month of purchase  of the  channels on this switch were dead
this is unacceptable quality control on such a simple devicei have been a ciscolinksys loyalist after dlink cut one too many corners on me in   so the need to extend my wrtgs ports out to an effective  meant buying a small  port from linksys and to buy it through amazonwell i plugged the puppy in on the same strip as my wrtg and my cable modem and immediately noticed a low but irritating hum coming from the power brick
i gave it a week or so to ensure that normal house noise would cover the noise no joy
if im in that room studying i can hear the buzzi called linksys tech support and they said  no known issues existed with the power supply brick and  i was supposed to go to a local electronics store and buy a replacement brick to diagnose the problem
nope that doesnt work for memy solution  im ordering a replacement unit today from amazon and will return one or both
while linksys is now cutting corners like dlink i have faith that amazon wont  they recently took care of a kindle issue that was more my fault than theirsif you buy this product you better pray it works
i purchased this product and it didnt work sent it back to amazon to get replaced
then it still didnt workyou might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasnt and that this is the nd faulty switch
however they have failed to send me an rma number to send it back to them
i have called every day for the past  weeks to try and obtain this elusive rma confirmation emailas of right now their tech supportcustomer service  number isnt even working or is overloadedif you buy this product i hope it works for you
but if you think you might need some service from the company you may want to think about going to a competitor are there any in this price rangei own the version of this switch back when cisco wasnt a part of it
in fact the computer this is being typed on is hooked up to it
my setup mb cable internet via a motorola surfboard fed to a router
that feeds a cable threaded through my basement to an old netgear switch that died hence the need for this new ezxsw ver
 switch
at that point my network splits and feeds the old version of this switch and then to this computeruntil i bought this new ezxsw switch i was getting more than my promised mb download speeds all over my house
no issues at all
the internal network transfers were only slowed down by how fast the hard drives of various machines are
then my old netgear switch died so i picked up this ezxsw switch
everything slowed to a crawl
max downloads of mb per second
streaming netflixamazon prime videos to my sharp connected tv takes ages to load and its always low quality
network transfers are brutal
took me a few days to realize what it was
so i went out and bought another brand of switch swapped it for the ezxsw and miracle of miracles all my speeds went right back to normalagain my ezxsw  says ver
 on it i dont know if thats relevant
what i do know is this thing is a piece of junk
avoidit came and it turned on and nothing hapend  ran an ip check on the network and nothing  software program ip check in case they changed the interface ip  the program sees my isp router but not this thingthey had free support until just very recently
my beef is with the extreme cost of support   a minute
 i dont know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music
you can get  months support for   months for  or  year for 
i can tell you i spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events
i have had my linksys router for  years
i also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldnt go through walls very well
i had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address
you will need tech support now and again when you change isps go elsewherethis is the worst router that i have ever had
continues to drop like crazy even with latest firmware from linksys
i ended up to throw it asidei have several other linksys switches so i decided to pick this one up
i have never had a problem w any of my linksys switches however this one was another story
at times my printers would see it and at times they would not
i have  computers networked and at times they could see it and other times not
an undefined network showed up in my network and sharing center as if the switch was acting like another entire network which i did not have access to
i finally gave up trying to make it work and bought a trendnet port unmanaged gigabit greennet desktop metal housing switch tegsg
i plugged it in the mysterious network disappeared and everything worked perfectly right out of the box my magic jack computers printers scanner two tvs and two blueray players
what more can be saidlinksys  port switch ezxsw ver  arrived fast in new shrink wrapped box from beach camera through amazon
the power adapter was dead on arrival
the switch ok  i had an old adapter for my  port to check it
 minutes on the phone and linksys is sending a new adapter rma in  business days
hope it works
ill be back if it doesntim back
got the rma replacement power adapter from linksys in  days
no joy
same problem
ive requested by email a return for exchange or refund to beach camera and hope they cover the return postage in either case
so far i cant blame beach at all but linksys support was less than cooperative the second time i called about the replacement adapter not solving the problem
the switch itself still will function with my old  port power adapter but neither of the new power adapters from linksys
i hooked my laptops to it and was up and running on the internet through the switch with the  port power adapter both timesinconsistent quality iffy installation in windows and diagnostics only in dos
this is the linksys lnetx
we have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have endedup regretting doing so
the price is what initially attracts but the shabby construction questionable installation and high failure rate  not to mention linksys horrible customer supportavoid this one
youre not saving any money buying this card
youre only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the linksys cardmy zip  suffered from the click of death and i lost about five disks and the whole drive before i learned on the internet about this wellknown problemi gave iomega my email address when i registered my drive but they didnt tell me that using their welldocumented defective drives ruins the disk with loss of all databut i had to get my data off so i bought a zip  and today i had the click of death again with total loss of data and a ruined expensive disk
arrgghneedless to say i would never recommend a zip drive and i am planning on forever boycotting iomegaand if you happen to run into a zip drive engineer who designed this turkey please give him or her a gentle dope slap for mewho at iomega thought this piece of engineering garbage was suitable for valuable data
if you are tempted to by a zip anyway search for click of death before buying a zip drive
i wonder how many countless gigabytes of data have been lostwhy zip disks were ever popular i will never know
they are one of the most unreliable and most expensive forms of data storage i have ever seen except for the jaz drive which happens to be made by the same companyif you want to store a lot of data for the least amount of money then go out and buy a cd writer especially if your media is going to be well traveled
i work for a print company in the electronic prepress department and i also have a small web design business and i cannot tell you how many times i have gotten a zip disk that has gone bad while it was being delivered to me
i have never had a problem with cds corrupting sure i have had some cds that dont work but that happened during the writing not because of the way it was stored or shippedsave me you and everyone else a huge headache by switching to cdrsthe palm v is the second palm product that i have owned
after purchasing a palm pro and experiencing numerous problems i upgraded to the v hoping to salvage my large database of entered addresses
and for the second time i am extremely disappointed with the palm products
both palm devices displayed the same problems specifically   after a few months of ownership the screen response begins to fail requiring almost daily recalibrations of the digitizer   many attempted recalibrations of the digitizer simply fail because the screen become so far out of alignment that the user can not enter necessary menu selections to even request a digitization   attempted full device resets become impossible since repeated full resets begin to no longer properly reset the device  as the screen begins to fail the ability to enter keystrokes in the graffiti language begins to decrease forcing a user to rely on the screens slow and tiny quotqwertyquot keyboard and  the operating system still lacks simple security such as permitting a user to set the device to automatically power off with a password lock if a user wants a security shutdown a user has to step through several screen strokes in order to explicitly shut the device off with a passwordno automated lock is available on power downi bought this camera just over a year ago for 
the camera worked great then mysteriously started displaying an e code when i tried to turn it on
when i looked into the owners manual i found that e indicates corrupt firmwarei went to a couple of camera shops around dallas tx but apparently only kodaks service center in illinois has access to replacement partscalled kodak and got the address to send it to along with an authorization number
they wanted  to replace the firmware
it only cost  when new
when i refused to pay this they still charged me  to get it mailed backi will never buy another kodak and if this review sways others from buying a kodak  i will be happy
kodak this is terrible service and disrespect to customers who drop a lot of money for one of your products
if anyone wants to offer me anything for this camera maybe someone out there knows how to repair it feel free to contact me with an offer
october sorry but amazon wont let me leave my email address
joe pooli have a bunch of cables from low to midendi would rate them somewhere in the middle between the low end and the mid end in terms of audio qualitythe connectors are a royal pain
they are way too tight which makes them very hard to plug in and even worse when its time to unplug them  they are so tight to a point one can damage the rca jack on the equipmenti wish i had kept the package otherwise these would be back for return in no timemonster has a reputation for making great cables but this series does not live up to monsters reputation
all other monster cables that i have used are substantial but the connectors on this model series are not made to last are flimsy and fall apart after time
cables should last longer than a receiveri had this about a year and mysteriously nothing plugged into it worked
thought i had blown a breaker
finally figured out this thing just suddenly stopped working no reset no onoff just stopped working
seems to be a lot of this happening with this strip
now i have to spend more money on a good oneon july   i received from amazon the monster cable mp av power protector  and the belkin surgemaster superior series outlet surge protector   joules
they both sold for about the same price
the monster is vastly inferior
the belkin has three times the joules rating
the belkin is much more attractive and well designed
the monster is just a squarish standard strip that felt very cheap compared to the belkin and worst of all the monster had a bad rubber stink and the cord felt gritty
the belkin had a smooth white power cord
my other mistake was to get the belkin with the  foot cord  i realized a  foot cord was available after ordering
you will be much happier with the belkin
i will post this exact review with the belkin as well
last time i gave something  star amazon did not display it
maybe the higher end monster models are nicermonster stakes out a claim as being the best in audio equipment
but this surge protector does not live up to the brand name
after a year or two of use only two of the six outlets work
when i began to have the problem and contacted monster i found myself on hold forever again and again and was provided with no helpful solution to my problem or easy way to have the device replaced
i have other noname brand surge protectors that have been rocking strong since the s
this one has been a disappointment
the only reason im on amazon today is that im shopping to replace this onewaste of money
it doesnt hold on to the plugs
buy the belkin
better quality fer sure
worth the money tooprice was great only  but after getting  units all three had cheesy construction
there was difficulty inserting plugs in all  units and after  weeks one unit completely failed on me
the reset button never popped and there was a smell from the failed unit that usually indicates melting or fused electrical components
no damage to items plugged in but i would advise all not to buy this outlet stripps the second strip failed on me the same way after a couple of weeks usage replacing the first one
only one of the three is still workingyou get what you pay for
i cannot understand how anyone rates this as a good item
i looks great and has a great cord but fails miserablythe proverbial book by the cover story
i will never buy monster products again
i have never had this poor a performance on a power strip in all my life
i did not get any electrical damage to what was plugged in when the failure was incurred but who needs the headache potential
pass on it heresince i cant give zero stars i guess one will have to dono power surge no electrical storm no brown out no sparks nor puff of smoke it just stopped working
the reset button did not even pop out
i should have gotten the apc or tripplite suppressorprosnice long flexible cable that hopefully i can reuse on another projectconsdifficult to insert plugs intomysteriously stopped working after amazon return period expiredif this was a joke then it wasnt even funnyi have like  of these things in the house radio shack belkin tripplite and apc and none of them has ever died in less than  months let alone ever
i even sold my first tripplite suppressor
if i have to pay a dollar to return it then it goes in the garbage binfailed after two months of use while only having a  inch tv plugged into it
inferior monster product
i wouldnt buy again
it seemed a good price for the item but not worth the headachewe were watching tv tonight and all off a sudden my tv and box go on and off and on and off while everything else stayed  on my house
next thing i know the house smells like burnt electronics
this quality surge protector was sizzling
im surprised the circuit didnt breaki am now on amazon buying a new surge protector but will not buy thisthis item failed after one month of usethere seem to be two breakers in this itemthe first one is tied to the reset button
this circuit is closest to the shared socket sidethe second one is tied to the onoff switch
this circuit is closest to the wall sidethe onoff switch is still lit uphowever none of the devices are getting power
the reset button is useless and does not workthis item will be returnedive used monster surge protectors in the past and had no reason to complain but when put to the test this one totally failed me
this is your basic surge protector strip with right angle plug and colorcoded plugs for various audiovisual components
but does it give them sufficient protection
unfortunately it did not for me
i was using it for my tivotv combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my tivo
so dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device
so now i get to experience this monster warranty process
suffice to say you will be lucky if you get anything out of them or can fulfill the requirements and  pages of information they want you to send them
in my case i have a tivo dvd that no one within several hundred miles of me is authorized to repair as they require and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim
i have to order a replacement part on the internet which they dont accept and they wont reimburse after the fact
you also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it
so basically the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself
so you can dock another star or two for that
so while i like the design of this surge protector i probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at leastrecieved as a gift used it for less than  year  it completely stopped working
had my computer plugged into it when the strip blew out
thankfully the computer is fine the strip got thrown in the trash
would not recommend
you pay for what you getthere are too many quality power strips out there to waste your money on this one
the number of failed strips now  one star reviews is an indication of just how risky it is to buy this item
the strip powers on but there is no power going to anything that is plugged into it
pure garbagethen there was suddenly a weird ringing sound and everything plugged into it turned offi need better reliability than thati buyed  this surge protection and i live in a country with vthis product dont support v what a shame 
at least put that info in the product details or some where 
  in shipping on the trash this is the most overpriced item i own several monster power items and their higher end units are great but this thing is worthless you might as well get a no name brandi had this thing one my rd tv and it fried out within  weeks and none of the others didbought a few of these based on the rating and features
we get small surges fairly often
had three of these units fail within a year
get a surge the powercenter trips and blows the main breaker on that circuit
shake the powercenter and you can hear little electronic bits rattling around inside
dead and not repairable
have a dozen or more surge protectors different  brands which are all just fine
monster are the only brand that regularly blow out
they should survive at least several small surges  without actually exploding inside
colorful but uselessthe item arrived in packaging looking like it had been opened prior and had been returned
plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didnt work
no power to the unit at all
the seller accepted the item as a return no problem
i didnt have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order including original shipping charge was refunded so i was pleased with that at least
ive learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky but with amazon i have never had a problem with any returnlot of good reviews but not a reliable piece of hw
i bought it because of  review but i dont trust all those reviews as i am completely dissatisfied with this product
onoff switch came off after just  months of use
not too much time in surge protector life spanthank god i did not really faced any power surge i cant imagine such low quality product saving any of my electronic deviceand if you have already dont similar mistake of buying this product then dont touch onoff switch and pray that it performs when time comesthis was my most expensive surge protector
i bought it to protect my brand new  plasma
for a while it worked fine but then it started to short out and got to the point where the cable box turned off
not wanting to risk damaging my tv i moved it for use with a simple lamp and phone
a couple weeks later it started whistling and then turned off completely
i never had a surge protector do that before and cringe at the thought of the damage it could have done to my plasma
stay away from this companycant use the item since it does not work with v power outlet europe standard power and theres no any information about this incompatibility
ive bought it to power all my devices with us power plug using one useu connector but when i switch that device on i just have a power outage in the room
now im not sure if it is still working at allit looks nice and is easy to installbut that is allafter a recent storm i had  worth of home theater equipment rendered inoperablethe result of my contact with monsterone generic email the nothing zipnadasave your moneyi had the hts for less than a year when one day it just stopped working
there was no lightning storm so it is a mystery why it happened
anyway monster technical support arranged for an exchange and i received it quickly
however the new one fails to work out of the box
im about to exchange this and am disappointed in their quality control  you would think that they would at least plug it into an outlet to ensure the ac light turns onthis product came in a timely fashion in perfect packaging and looked brand new
however it simply does not work
the power light is on the ground light is on and the protection enabled light is on however only half of the surge protector has power the half with only  outlets
no matter what i do where i plug it in or how many times i reset it the second half of the surge protector does not power anythingim sure this product has potential but mine did not function as expectedim in the process of returning it for a refundryanupdated reviewlet me say  im not a kneejerk reactionary who goes around trashing products for no good reason
in fact i get a little annoyed when people post star reviews because they happened to get a  in a  bad copywell sometimes enough is enough
i ordered two of these and one was doa as described in my original review
hey these things happen right
so amazon not monster sent me a replacement
it worked
forgive and forget
well because they were such a good deal i ordered a third one
unfortunately i did not have a need to open it up and use it until today
guess what
another screaming piece of junk
 out of  doa
and of course its far too late to send this one back
monsters credibility has gone right down the toilet in my opinion although i did also buy one of the big component boxes for my stereo rack and it has performed admirably but im done with their power strip models
 out of  defective units is just poor design and horrible quality controlso there may be a reason the price of these has really fallenfeel free to take a chance you might get a deal just make sure you test it as soon as you get it instead of sticking it in the closet like i didoriginal review  starsbecause of monsters selfproclaimed reputation it was a bit surprising to find that mine arrived doa
in reading the reviews it seems this is more common than it should be
after nearly killing myself on the horrible blister pack and hooking up all my equipment i found that the alarm was always screaming when the unit was plugged in
it was not the electrical service in my houseit arrived on saturday so when i called their customer service number naturally they were closed
so i took the easy way out and returned it to amazon amazing service
reported on saturday ups picked up the broken one on monday and new one was delivered on tuesday
no hassle
thanks amazon
new one seems to work finedoes it improve the video and sound quality of my all digital home theater
who knows
i dont want to get into that debate but i do feel youd have to have very high end equipment and ears to match or have especially dirty electrical lines or do a lot of analog in order to definitively telli wouldnt come close to paying msrp but at the fantastic price amazon is selling these for who cares
its a nifty little device that offers a little extra peace of mind for only a couple of bucks more than a generic surge protected power stripnote that it also protects your phone line mines voip so it might not matter and tvsatellite cable
it includes a set of monster cables for each a claimed  value
i think its an actual value of less than half that but still the cables alone make up for the price difference between this and an imitation power strip
the stickers they give you for labeling your power cords is a nice touch toonote neither of the two i received was blue as in the photo
its dark on the bottom and an odd halfway between gold and silver on the top
i would have slightly preferred the blue but its hiding behind the av rack anywayim docking them a star because of the first piece of junk they sent and i cant scientifically attest to the quality of the results but based on their claims the extra peace of mind bonus cables and low price this is a great deal
im going to buy a few morei grabbed these cables with the impression that monsters advertising has some truth in it
i was expecting a brighterclearer image on my big screen that what i was getting with some  other brand cablesguess what
i havent seen any improvement yet aside from the money that i am missing
i tried these cables and the thx certified monster cables with no observable effects whatsoeverperhaps there is a noticeble difference between these and the dinky cables included with most dvd players but the same can be said for the  cables that i was usingi compared a monster cable vs one the one from phillips which costs less than half this
and guess what no difference
thats right
they rip you off
and whats the purpose off a gold plated connection if the rest of the signal passes through a copper cableit irks me see the staff at bestbuy and circuit city pitching monsters  component cables and  hdmi cables at uneducated customers
there are cheaper and equally performing cables out there
do your research and save some of your hard earned moneyby the way be wary of all the glowing reviews you read on amazon for this product or for others as well
recently i have been seeing a lot of positive reviews from anonymous reviewers or reviewers with only one review to their namefor some years i tried this and other monster products to the tune of over  in monster av gear
the more you learn about video and audio the more youll avoid anything with the monster label
specifically this svideo meets no ntsc dvd or ieee standard it is common ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed lowconductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding
has a sharp image but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from offcolor skin tones to color blotching dirty grays burned highlights murky shadows noisy reds and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds
makes video test patterns look great but who watches test patterns all day
amazon offers many other brands at good prices why waste your  on this stuff
i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar belden viewsonics and others from amazon
result vast improvement in every respectwe have a very highend home theater system which clearly shows the contribution for good or ill of every component
we pulled this turkey instantly and sent it backi dont know how monster charges these prices with a straight face
my cable guy said we dont use these  not recommended  does not improve reception
my cable company uses standard redlabeled lower cost mhz splitters
they work just finei really dont get it how monster just gets away pricing their junk like this
i got this months ago to fix some loss issues
saw this shiny think with overpriced tag and thought it will resolve the issue
after using this the hd was creating problems tvs in my other rooms were having huge issues with signal
finally went back to comcasts splitter and all was well
they recommended not to use this
i totally agree
nice gold plating though
can be in a display cabinet
not just this monster product but so many of their products are simply overpriced when compared to the same quality in some cases average than normal qualitywell i needed some minidiscs just so i could record a bunch of cds and  take them up to work which is where i mainly use my portable player
i  havent recorded on them all yet but so far  of them are messed  upeither they appear to record correctly and then cant be played or  they wont even start recording
they seem like a good value but if you  take out the  that have failed so far im paying the same amount for  these as other discs and these dont come without cases
i give them   star because zero stars isnt an optionbuy sony or tdk
these are made cheaplythe cards networked just fine but internet connection sharing will not work
netgear techsupport iss free but useless
they told me to call microsoft
documentation is very skimpy and the online info is not much better
i am going to try wingate and if ics still wont work yank the cardsthe product is shipped with a notice stating that installation instructions are to be seen on vikings web site which for me has thus far failed to loadi would avoid this compact flash card  ive gone thru two both which proved to be defectivean executive plaything that cant do what a buyer wouldexpect
garmins mapsouce products are oudated inaccurate andoverpriced
the etrex  does all that this unit can do and it ishalf the price
remenber keep it simple stupidi bought this unit to take with me deer hunting
it did not track the satellites initially so i returned it
i had the same difficulty with the second unit
the seller couldnt explain why both malfunctioned so i just got my money back
my advice is to take  aa batteries with you open the package install them and test the unit before you leave the parking lot
i guess there are no satellites over gray georgiai own one of these and i was really looking forward to it as an upgrade of my old gps
what a big mistake
my background im a mountain climber experienced land navigator and use my gps offtrail all the time
my normal use for the gps is to confirm my location and figure out the bearings to other mountains so i can be sure which summit is which when viewing them from new locations
but i have actually used the gps for real navigation when caught out on a glacier in dense fog
the problem isnt the unit itself really
the antenna works fine and easily picks up a solid signal even from inside my house top floor not bottom floor
but the operating system is terriblethe gps was much more usable
for example this unit does not even feature a simple you are here page
you have to actually mark a waypoint and then get it to display the location of that waypointfor only about  more you can get the garmin etrex venture which is much more useful
frankly i cant wait to break my etrex so i can justify upgrading itthis is the bottom end of gps units and it showswho would put a hole presumably to equalize pressure
in the back of a portable gps
ipx no way
what did garmin expect would happen if a warm gps fell into cold water
very first time it went  into water for no more than five seconds it sucked water in and never would turn on again
a simple internal bladder is all it would take
this thing is garbage if you need it any where near wateri highly recommend not getting this unit
the garmin unit doesnt work well enough to do anything with
im up high on a mountain with great sky coverage lots of satellite lock in awful inaccuracy
waste of moneyfor certain applications mb is the only option

sandisk compactflash card read and write speeds are so bad
i use canon pro and canon d camera which have raw format

even the newest sandisk ultra compactflash doesnt work faster than others
however its price is so highyou could get full test review onlineif you use basic digital camera with below  megapixels resolution and save with jpg format it is ok for you with mb
otherwise please dont buy this one
choosing other companys compactflash is better for youi have over a year of frustrating experience with this product running under winme
the thing constantly locks up
the only way i can get it to be even slightly stable is to reboot between reading cards
otherwise the system locks up whenever going from one card to the next
horrible drivers
my experience with it on win was too short to be sure but having to live with this product has been bad enough
i hardly use it now but im disappointed to see that ill likely have to throw it away when i go to winxp
no matter its barely worked anywayi have bought all of my recently purchased digital camera stuff here
so far everything works great
i would like to buy a card reader but the reviews are scary  especially the cards getting damaged by the reader
i wrote to sandisk about this problem but have heard nothing back
i hope more purchasers will write additional reviews to let us know about the card damage problemthere are currently no drivers available for this product for windows xpthe sandisk web site simply says quotthis device is not supported in windows xpquot  there is no promise for creation of new windows xp driverstried the sandisk reader on a new hp and the computer would not find it
next tried in on a brand new gateway  mhz windows 
this computer  does not like it
the reader constantly locks up the entire computer
found the serial cable to be much more reliable than this horrible piece of  equipmenthonestly i expected much more from wireless headphonesthese headphones disappointed me so much that i had toreturn the product back to the store the very next daystatic interference occuring every  seconds was the only reasonwhy i didnt like them

asin btzjibuy a maxtor at your own peril
i have a dell gig  machine with the maxtor g harddrive as part of the initial build
less than two weeks after my machine came off warranty the drive failed completely and utterlyin breaking down my box i found that the warranty was marked on the outside of the hd as aug  its presently jul 
so i called maxtor
they claimed the hd warranty ended in may   the rep asked me to send proof which after some further discussion was a fax sent to maxtor which i had to send  times
after getting maxtor support to help for about  minutes they suddenly said this drive was oemd by dell and as such you have to deal with them
when i pointed out that the warranty was still good according to the hd i was handed around and eventually told tough luckim going to try my luck with western digitali own two such drives
both failed in less then two years one completely the second one still works if mounted quotupside downquot otherwise the motor cannot start
i think there are some motor reliability problem with this particular drive and it is more common that one can assume from the posts or web research
may be similar to ibms problems but i may just have a bad luck
i also own  i western digital drives with mb cache and they all are still alive
again this might be a coincidence  but please be careful before buying this drive especially as a replacementi bought this device at least six or seven years ago
i should have shorted the crap out of palm when i had a chance
when the batteries two aaa are drained you will lose all your data in the device
not only that the lack of back light makes it difficult to read in an airplane a dark conference room or in a dark restaurantthis device along with a very nice leather case will be donated to charitythis thing is a dinosaur at this point
are they even selling it
i wouldnt waste my money on iti have the palm iiixe which works ok it went on the blink so i tried to buy another
no dice
i bought a iiic instead
from day one it barely worked
when i touch the stylus to a letter or number on the screen it jumps to another letter or number or just wont work
the graffiti is very poor with many repeat strokes for any letter
for data insertion it is worthless
i only use it for playing chess nowbroke three of my cds the first day i owned it
i blame myself for buying s technology when i should have invested in mp  ipod technology which i did
cds and cd changers like this are dead technologies
sorry but thats the way it isamazon compensated me with a  credit for the broken cds so they certainly have done their part
i love amazoncomi got my nomad ii today and immediately downloaded some favorite mps as well as samples included in the box
all files were sampled at  kps khz
all files also play back with compression artifacts  flanging pops whistles cracks and skips
the firmware codec is  defective as these files play fine on my pc with software codecs
i tried  upgrading the firmware to the latest version but keep getting an error
the only way to get tech support from creative is to call a toll numberproducts should work out of the box without user intervention
this  one doesnt
i plan on returning it tomorrow
i read another review that  recommended buying a minidisc player for about  usd less
sounds like  a great ideafor all of those who have had trouble getting this to hotsync under winxp a palm support person finally got it fixed for me with a very simple solution
make sure of the following make sure you are using palm desktop  not anything later
if you need to uninstall  and download the older desktop  it is hard to find but can be found here  from there basically follow palms instructions except make sure both local serial and local usb are checked in the hotsync menu check under hotsync setup that the hotsync virtual com port used matches the palmconnect com port under hardwaredevice managerports com  lpt and set the speed to the slowest speed 
this is the key to all our problemsthen after successfully performing a hotsync at the slow speed you can bump the speed back up to as fast as possiblewith this ill bump my rating up to  stars because it works but has poor manual and web site explanations for installing the driversbelow is my original onestar review from yesterday for referencethe box says its compatible with win me and  palm supposedly has upgraded the drivers for xp i downloaded these from the palm web site
when installing this on a new laptop with winxp with no serial port according to the instructions everything seems to install fairly smoothly except that afterwards hotsync cant find the serial port its looking for
which of course is the whole point of the device
i tried the suggestion of another user who said you need to use version  of palm desktop
i tried that and it gets a little farther along recognizing usb serial adaptor as the installation device but still doesnt work
very frustratingthis product really does not work correctly with windows xp
after multiple inquiries to palms website which responds promptly i have now been told that i must first unplug the usb connector before powering down the computer
otherwise each time the computer is turned on the palmconnect software must be reinstalled
hardly the level of convenience i expect from palmif you leave your computer on all the time and there are not frequent power outages in your area or you dont mind unplugging and replugging the usb connector every time you power down this product will work under windows xp
not acceptable in my opiniongreat case  however doesnt work for palm viix which doesnt even fit into the case
also didnt work for my wifes handspring visor which fit but was turned on everytime the case was zippered upi dont understand how these get more than one starthey are poorly constructed and i couldnt get them to focusbelieve me im not a binocular snob these are crap
the knob sticks they feel cheap and the image is poorthey should be putting these in cereal boxes
seriously they are not worth the effort of ordering and carrying around your necki sent them backi purchased these xs so that i could have a small and lightweight pair of binoculars to take on outdoor outings with my wife
i own a pair of old bushnell instavision x bincoulars that are excellent for me but due to my wifes nearsightedness do not work for her
i was hoping that these would be as good as my other bushnell binoculars and work for both me and my wife but i was really disappointed
the field of view does not seem to be as wide a claimed and the misalignment between the two sides was such that the left and right images would not merge when i viewed though them
the effect was rather like trying to look through a pair of tubes
there were also a lot of bad internal reflections
all in all i found these to be totally unusableit really is a dispappointment about the poor optics because that size weight and general form factors was othewise excellenti bought these for a trip to yellowstone
the only word i can think to describe the image is foggy especially in bright sunlight
i ended up using a pair of x tasco cheapies that have a much clearer image than these
the x extra magnification doesnt do any good since the image is so bad
i dont know if mine are defective or if it is just the quality of the binocs
they are also much bigger than i expected but still very compact
i will definitely be returning thesewell call the  star rating for the compactness and look  feel of thesethese binoculars look good and feel good but the pair i received performed abysmally
they have been returned for a refund
there are too many alternatives out there to mess with a manufacturer who apparently doesnt test what comes off the assembly line
my pair had exactly the same problem reported in the other negative review namely a doubled image
i had no problem getting both sides simultaneously in focus with good clarity on both sides but no amount of additional fiddling with the binoculars would eliminate the doubled image
such an inexcusable alignment error represents either lack of testing of the finished product poor design or poor internal construction
over the years ive owned a number of binoculars from other manufacturers and none had this kind of problem
since the binoculars i received can only be used as a monocular one star is as good a rating as they meritmaybe we got a lemonlooking through the binoculars you get a double image like the left eye monocular was not pointing in the same direction as the right eye monoculari had a similardesign pair of decent binoculars years ago nikons i think which were of course more expensive
i was expecting these to be as small as those were
these are smallish but definitely not pocketable in a shirt
i was hoping to give them to a friend as an improvement on opera glasses but they are way too big and only marginally better opticallythe optical quality is about what youd expect for  or so
the eyepoint is awkward theres a bright ring of light around the image and there just isnt any sharpness except in the very middle of the image
flare characteristics are terrible
but if i were  years old id think they were pretty cool
they look reasonably tough as long as you keep them dryif you want something small to really look at things try to get something at the lower end of the price scale of the name brands nikon canon vortex olympus pentaxim going to keep these in my cars trunk just in case im desperatei bought these to use at our outdoor concerts here the first of which was last night
based on the good reviews i got these and didnt do more than look through them briefly in the house when they came just to make sure they werent broken
the first time they were used for distance outside was last night at a concertand they were blurryi thought maybe they put protective plastic over the glass for shipping but could not see any
these were still virtually untouched in the original box
i found a wrapped lens cleaning cloth included and tried to clean all four glass lenses but it made no difference
i asked others to look through them as well to make sure it wasnt just my eyes but they said they were blurry as welleveryone tried adjusting them but they were never right
i pulled up my amazon account on my phone to see about returning them and sure enough it was less than a week past the  month return window
that means i am stuck with a new pair of defective binoculars
i work all the time and have no opportunity to use or test binoculars other than at a show
it would seem that there ought to be an exception for clearly defective productsi would definitely not recommend this productthis item had pretty mixed up reviews when i was buying them
some people loved it at  stars others hated it saying they couldnt see anything out of them at  star
undortunately i joined those who couldnt see anything
believe me you when i say ive used a lot of binoculars so im now a newb to this
i bought them specifically for one purpose shooting range and identifying where the bullet hits on target at  yards  yeah good luck
by the time i dialed in and finally was able to barely see the target though still looking very very smudgy my husband unloaded  ar mags
wouldnt even pass this as a toy binocular my sons  chinese made plastic crap shows clearer imageim an amazon fan and simply point out great products and their sellers as well bad ones well for all of you who had a great experience i simply say good for you
i wished i was one of youif it were possible id rank  stars
i ordered these simple binoculars more than  weeks ago with shipping expected to take no more than a few days that was nov th it is now dec th
no notice no contact from anyone as to where these binocs are
tracking of this shipment seemed to vanish after nov th with nothing further info wise to look upwhats worse i felt that  weeks lead time was easy enough for amazon to fulfill on such a common place item for a sporting event i am attending this weekendapparently not in this case
frustrating waste of time heres the kicker i ask for a refund  because i never even got what id paid for
and now i am being charged practically half of what these things cost out of my refund for them to be returned
where are they even being returned from ridiculouscould not get both eyes focused at the same time
poor quality
really surprised by bushnell
i assumed the other bad reviews were just flukes i guess not
returned themi returned this
i could not adjust it all
maybe its me but i couldnt see anything magnified especially at nightand there werent any instructions eithernot having done my homework and knowing nothing about binoculars i mistakenly expected a higher magnification to be better  not
using these  x  binoculars is like viewing through lenses held by someone with parkinsons disease  very shaky
i kept checking my hands  which didnt feel shaky at all  to make sure they werent actually shaking and they werent
later i read that binoculars with higher magnification produce very shaky images unless the binoculars are held still as with a tripodworse you have to constantly adjust these if you try to view to the  left right towards you or farther away
in short a pain in the butt
i get eye strain and headaches after just a minute or  of using these
a waste of money
no i wont buy a tripod i bought these because they were cheap and because i didnt want to spend much money for the limited viewing id be hopefully doing
i ordered a pair of  x  and will see how they work outthis product has double image or ghost image you send me so with this problems and now is costly for me resend this damage product to you
how we solve this problem now
it is th binocular you send me with damage or defective
wath happend with customer service of you for cash purchases
please solve this problem as soon as possible
mr rolando gomezapparently i am a slow learner in that by this stage of my life i should have long since learned that you get what you pay for
based on some great reviews on amazon i decided to purchase a pair of these binocularsas i lifted them out of the case a plate that covers the bottom of the focuser immediately dropped to the floor
i assumed that it was something that snapped into place but alas it is apparently supposed to be glued into place
close inspection of the eyepieces revealed uneven fitting between the lens holders and rubber that surrounds them
amazingly they came with no eye piece covers and the thin string that apparently is made to place over your head is a joke  im sure that will last only a few sessions
i did not find the right eyepiece particularly easy to focus and i might add that you had better be prepared to rest these on something if you want an image that you can comfortably viewi found the instructions to be less than adequate
probably appropriately the english version is the th set of instructions
they are written with a microscopic font and are generic in nature not referring to these specific binoculars
come on bushnell you have been in business long enough to break the code on producing good optical devices
you failed with this onei would return them but for the price it is not worth my time or effort
it will make good junk drawer fodderthese binoculars are terrible in my opinion
i could not even use them without closing one eye
none of my family members were able to use these
i ended up returning themthe focusing of these binoculars are horrible
it is terrible compared to the olympus i bought from amazon
the olympus is double the price but it is far more superior
trust me dont get the bushnell and go for the olympus
i wish i hadnt purchase iti purchased this device for general use on vacation with no specific intentions
i actually found myself using my digital cameras zoom functions for distant viewing than using these binoculars
buy a better set of binoculars if you actually intend to use them for more than bird watching which might be painful at mm anywaythese things are total crap
i bought a pair that arrived with the objective lenses out of whack so you always see two images of everything
i sent them back to amazon and got a replacement pair
the second pair had the exact same problem as the first pairi sent the second pair to bushnell who told me they were messed up duh
they would replace them for a  fee what
 so i went with that
the third pair arrived direct from bushnell and the righthand forward lens and tube were lying in the box separated from the main body of the binoculars
i contacted bushnell again had to forward pictures and they sent me a forth pair
the fourth pair had the exact same problem as the first two so i threw them in the trash and bought leupoldthese binoculars are the worst optics ive ever seen
dull images were out of focus and i could never get the pair to focus correctly
i had such high hopes as i remember bushnell being superior quality
not any more
the optics are so bad i was literally seeing double images
do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this productthese binoculars were sent back for refundi own a pair of bushnell x binoculars and they work just fine but i wanted to get something that was a little stronger so i purchased the x and after receiving them i was disappointed in them because they would not focus clearly
i followed the instructions on focussing but they just would not focus well enough to see things clearly
there were parts that seemed to be loose and when using the focus rocker i could see the two lens wobbling
these were just poorly made
i have sent them back to amazon for a refundsaw double images no matter where they were focused
it was like looking through two scopes the images never came together
maybe you need to have wide angle eyes to use thesei had a bad experience with my bushnell purchase and the customer service at bushnell is terrible you just receive form emails back all the timei purchased these binos because they appeared to be a good deal
however they didnt turn out to be
the binos arrived with one of the lenses bent inward significantly
i returned them to amazon with no hassle
the representative who helped me over the phone was very nice and even sent me a replacement the very next day
the replacement binos seemed fine at first but then i noticed that the lenses were slightly crooked
so when viewing an object both eyes have different perspectives which creates a blurred view
the only way to view an object clearly is to keep one eye closed
i would return these too but i threw away the manufacturers packaging
i wouldnt recommend these
if i had to do it all over again i would pay a little more for something betterreceived these today
made sure the interpupillary distance and the diopter were set correctly and the binoculars still produced a double image
the factory seals on the package indicate these were not previously returned or tampered with
they either slipped past quality control or were somehow knocked out of alignment during shippingbinoculars that cant handle a  day trip in shipping arent durable enough for field use and if they left the factory like that qc needs to be more vigilant
in any case they are unusable in this conditionits a shame because they otherwise appear to be good build quality
the fit and finish was nice
but i need to look through them not just look at themthree problems
focus mechanism to flimsy bends when you put binoculars to your head
the adjustable eyepiece ran out of adjustment for my eyes
the interpupillary adjustment did not open enough for my eyes to get a single circlei have a pair of bushnell  x  binoculars and theyre great but this item is a dud returned for credit
disappointed in bushnell with theseno single view
lenses are not aligned properly so you see two round views as opposed to one pic that you should see in a quality binocpurchased unit at the suggestion of cisco sales rep after inquiry on home network set up and getting my cisco wireless router to cover the whole houseset up was a bit long and required paying cisco a fee to get all my devices up and running had a wireless cisco  that was outshide warranty period and had to pay a fee to get it set up on this routerlong story short  unit worked well when it worked but had frequent loss of connectivity and required reset each timefinally got on phone with cisco tech support and tried to fixinexperienced tech on phone flashed unit but was unable to get it to work again  two hours later on phone he gave up and offerred replacement via paid rma tofrom  ship to get it replaced  no empathy on his error  just put me on hold for the next custoemr service rep to process rma
his last comment was this is not the right unit for your house  you need to upgradeend of day  paid more than the original cost to set it up and return the bad unit backjust sharing after using this awhile it seemed to give me a lot of problems
i finally gave in and bought another brand belkin and i have had no headaches since then
wouldnt buy another linksys againi have a very early version of this router in my home network
i assume it is v because it has been in use for at least a decade probably longer
it has been in use so long i honestly forget
that router has been rock solid all these years and i use the advanced upnp and port range forwarding features
you would think the newer version would still be dependable  sigh
not soi wanted a router for my moms home network so i purchased version  of this router while i am visiting for the holidays
i read all the negative reviews about the router freezing and the need to cycle power frequently
i decided to give it a chance anyhow given the flawless history of the early version i have at home
darn dont waste your time and money like i did
the new version really is a pos like so many reviewers before me have statedit has been in use for a week now and it is going back to the store today
i have to cycle power every day sometimes several times a day
i have never purchased anything but linksys hubs switches routers modems and waps
sad this loyal customer must switch brands because the quality i have enjoyed in the past is no longer built into linksys products at least this model for sure
i will try the dlink dgl and hope i have better lucki have had several of these routers over the years i currently have the v but the problem i am having is not version specific
i get disconnected from irc and any messenger i am using about ever   minutes at best
i have changed the firmware numerous times i have reset the router i have actually changed the router out to no avail
this equipment is faulty and linksys refuses to acknowledge the problem
if you type in befsrdisconnects you will see this is a problem with the entire product line and most of us can not resolve this without removing this piece of equipment from the equationi purchased this router to replace an smc barricade nat router i have behind a linksys wireless router for security
the wireless linksys works very well
my connection drops now and then and i thought it might be the smc because its several years old and the befsr might be more compatible
the problem i had was that i couldnt get the password to reset no matter what i did
i followed the directions that came with the router and went on the web site to be sure i was doing it properly
couldnt reset it to the factory settings and couldnt get access with the easy password i used to set it up
i think this one was just defective
my linksys wireless works great all the timei have owned this unit for six months
everything was fine until i built a new pc and attempted to set the pppoe for the new pc
after accessing the setup menu and making the necessary changes everytime i hit save i would get the logonpassword window and couldnt get past itmultiple calls to linksys tech support were routed to india where i was repeatedly instucted to uselessly reset the modem
finally they told me to rma the unit
i was not happy when i discovered i was required to pay for the return shipping of the suspect unit even though my unit was still under warrantythe replacement unit arrived and i wired it up same problem
infuriated i called again
the guy who answered listened to my description of the problem said i know how to fix that and had me make one change in windows voila it workednow i had to return the unnecessary replacement router again on my nickel
when i expressed my frustration with  all the previous cs reps who didnt know the solution heres the really funny part  he asked me were you talking to india
yes i said and he replied the indians are all idiots
were in the philippines
next time you have a problem make sure youre talking to the philippines
well there you have it the third world at war with itself for americas hearts and minds
linksys corporate should be proud
sheeeeeshi had an aging dlink dgl that went through  years of very heavy use and became unreliable a month and a half ago
i wanted to replace the router fast so i bit the bullet and bought this linksys befsr without sufficient research
it is linksys a well known brandbig mistake
this thing is absolutely worthless
if you research this router as i should have you will find this router is notorious for losing connection
occasionally at first then it starts dropping connection daily and then by the minuteas i was digging through boxes of computer parts looking for the power adapter to my mothballed dgl i was shocked to find an old gigafast router i had long forgotten i had
with the same cables same computers and same modem i placed the gigafast router into my network and instantly zero issues stable connection and i even did a speed test and this  year old   discontinued and a slight bit slow gigafast router vastly outperformed the linksys befsr even when my linksys was brand new and properly functioning a mere two months agoto further test out the network
i went ahead and placed the dgl back in the network and found it too still functioned in the network how ever sluggishly as it has been worn out and cooked for yearsafter  hours of router swapping wire swapping firmware updates and rollbacks ac adapter tests various browser tests cmd prompt tests i have come to the conclusion that all of my network problems start and end with the linksys befsr
two months old
unusable
unbelievablemaybe you will be lucky and have no issues but as i have experienced and researched in the tech savvy world this product is a wellderided piece of garbageive worked as a computer tech support consultant for years
so i thought this would be a breezemy goal was to free up my proxy server for other  uses
this seemed to be a good and cheap alternative to a computer
i  realized that i would be giving up some of the security capabilities of my  proxy server when i did thisi was not using dhcp within the network  but was being served an ip address to the cable modem via dhcp
also one  of my servers was set up for the default ip address of the routeri  was unable to get the router to recognize the network
i tried setting it  up as a stand alone router and still this didnt work
i changed the ip  number of one of my servers tried reinstalling it the router using the  default configuration
tried resetting it several times
you name it i  tried itafter a week with no internet access i decided the benfits did  not outweight the continued hassle
the benefit of running a proxy server  won
i reconfigured my proxy server which has performed beautifully since
the proxy has the benefit of being more configurable and provides a better  firewalli think i could have eventually gotten the linksys router to  work but felt it was not worth the extended effortif you have simple  network and do not need to make configuration changes to either the network  or this router it would probably install ok  if you have a more  complicated network with specific options on how dhcp is being used and  dont want to run the default router settings you may run into problemswhen linksys products work they are wonderful however their customer tech support is extremely difficult to uselinksys tech support is a maze of phone calls robot voicesetcyou get switched to different level the peterprincipal being very evident as you slog along trying to even understand what they are sayingive owned  different linksys products over a yr time frame one of the products worked for yrs thats a record with linksys the rest died and were thrown in the trash within monthslinksys not worth all the botheri purchased the befsr for a lan at home  to connect a couple of macs and a pc laptop to a cable modem and ethernet network
i was unable to configure it from the instructions  which were not macfriendlylinksys tech support tried to help but finally admitted that they didnt have much expertise with mac os and we were unsuccessful in helping me get it to worki ultimately returned the linksys router and purchased an asante friendlynet fr for about the same price
it worked the first time and asante knows macsif you are a mac user until linksys gets more mac oriented id recommend that you consider another productdoesnt inform you that you need to go auto config in wondows  if you go static ip you are screwedi get disconnected at least  or  times a day using these linksys wireless routers
do your research and buy something like netgear or dlinkat best each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait  minutes to get back online again
if youre doing something important forget itbought this to replace a dlink router that is getting flaky and spent an entire frustrating afternoon with it
ip obtained no network capability
updated the firmware even no help
the website offered advice on resolving that in no way matched any software either available on the website or the software that came with the product
finally i plugged back in my dlink and am temporarily back in business  will look elsewhere for a solution
at least the dlink came with understandable software and a website that is comprehensiblei liked this router initially as setup was easy and the html interface to all the features was really nicethen it startedmy network connection would just go awayi looked in vain at my software applications and then finally figured out that it was the router
i had to powerdown then power back up the router then it would work again for a whilei called linksys tech support  and after finally getting through i was told to reinstall windows  and that would solve the problemi took another tack and bought a netgear rt
the netgear isnt nearly as pretty and anything beyond simple setup requires you to telnet into the router instead of using a web interface butbutbutit has run and run and run and run and ive never had to touch it
ive never had to power it down onceit just worksso avoid the linksys and get a netgeari purchased this product with the expectation that it would provide at least the level of operation stated it the description
unfortunately this is not the case
this device will either operate as a poor interface with the internet or will allow limited operation between connnected devices but  not both
after spending many hours  with their phillipines based support group it has been determined that this is the way it works
i would suggest that anybody who purchases this device to do so at their own risknot at all easy to install or use
there are many many options which you have no access to through the installation cd
there is a web interface for setting options but the address is nowhere to be found in the documentation
you have to hunt through the linksys web site to find it
then go through tons of linksys faqs to find information for the different settings and what to do if things go wrongafter hours and hours of investigation and setting different options and going through technical support my internet connection was still slow and constantly breaking off
definitely not a good producti read reviews but not on usenet about how great this router was  but when i started using it with my linux and windows se boxes attached to an home cable modem i noticed that every ftp download and every other image  had checksum errors
very odd  in my  years of bbscerfnetinternet  experience i had never seen crc corruption issuesthe user experience  was that ftp was completely broken and that every fifth image on a webpage  would look like noiselinksys has a firmware upgrade  and even after  applying the thing i still have connection refused issues and corrupt  downloads that mysteriously go away when i take the router out of the  picture
terriblei returned mine and got a netgear router
make sure  you do some usenet research  or be prepared to take it back  this seems  to be a common problem with this router  it even refers to the corruption  problems in the quotfrequently asked questionsquot that came with the  thing
it tells you to use a different ftp client  hah
 as if that would  fix their hardware issue
oh well
viva la competitioni bought this router and everything seemed to work fine at first
then i started noticing that things just stopped working
none of my computers could get to the internet
so i hit the reset button on the router and everything appeared to be working againuntil the next dayto make a long story short it seemed like everyday i had to hit the reset button and the router eventually stopped working altogether
frustrated i bought the equivalent router from netgear and have never had a problem sincehope this helps you avoid my mistakes
do yourself a favor and go with netgear right off the bati used this for  months before upgrading to windows   dont know if the upgrade had an effect but the router  never worked well after that
i spent about  hours with linksys and they wound up blaming att
spent more hours with att who were quick to blame linksys
dead end here and no guarantee
i wound up buying an att modemrouter which installed easily and works fine so far
beware using this router if you have att dsli first tried the linksys  port cabledsl router and it was such a peice of junk
it dropped my connection constantly it needed to be reset daily in order to work
linksys tech support was absolutely horribly and the people there barely spoke english
ithe linksys is also made of cheap plastic not very durable at all the netgear router is metal very sturdy
amazon was awesome when i called them and told them the product was  and they accepted my return   i then got the netgear rt and wow it has worked without issue for well over a year now not one single glitch
their tech support is very fast and generally very helpful especially when i have contacted them about issues for things i was just trying to do basically for using it to set up game and ftp servers and such
excellent buy dont look at any other company for routers
i am also using one of their netork hard drives print servers hub and network cards all have given me zero problemsthis is the second one of these that has gave out on me
this one is still in warranty but the customer service claims they dont recognize the dealer and that it is probably a refurbished one
the dealer probably sells more of these than any other dealer in canada and it was definitely a new one
the dealer told me they always tell everyone this so they dont have to replace anything and to just keep calling back until you get someone on the phone that actually knows somethingi had also previously contacted online help who gave me the instructions on how to fix it
of course being that this product is cooked the instructions were useless
i replied to their email of our conversation and told them this and asked what i was supposed to do to get warranty but of course they never replied backthis product is just not worth the trouble of buying nor is it worth the trouble of trying to get your warranty fulfilledi have read that netgear makes very dependable routers
never a cisco product againfinally disconnected this piece of doodoo
got very tired of resetting unplugging etc
man never thought a wired connection would be such a pain in the what they dont tell you is that the item works with very limited os systems and there hasnt been a firmware update forever to accommodate newer os
sent this back right awayi purchased this instead of the belkin soley on name recognition and good past exeriences with linksys routersunfortunately their good name doesnt transfer to their other product lines
first the video cables were mf rather than mm like most other switches so i had to buy new cables just for this thing
second after hooking up all the cables i see how awkward it is to place this on a desktop with cables sticking out in  different directions same complaint as another reveiwer
third the switchs hot keys would not switch between computers  instead it would just rotate my screen  degrees
forth i called linksys support and after about  quotplease wait while i look something upquot i got transferred to their sales department and they said i had to buy their cables
after i told them that was unacceptable they offered to sell me a new router  ugh
im returning this pos as soon as possiblei have owned a variety of headphones over the years
from very expensive electrostatic units to cheapy sony ear buds for my walkman
these are by a wide margin the worst headphone i have ever heard
why
while they show the ability to resolve and have a wide dynamic range they have been tuned so drastically to emphasize the bass that they are virtually unlistenable
i am not exagerating the extent of bass boostto get a sound similar to my reference headphones a pair of grado reference phones i need to turn down the bass control on my reciever by 
they resolve they play the highs and mids wellbut the bass is for a teenager who has no desire other than to hear boomboom
this is the headphone equivalent to those horribly annoying cars you hear at stop lights thumping and bothering the whole neighborhoodso if youre down you might like theseif you want to hear music reproduced anywhere like it was meantstay awayi had a poor experience with sennheiser as a company
i received a pair of hd s
these are not inexpensive headphones and wanted closed not open headphones
i unpacked the product and put them to my ears and they broke in half
i had a piece of headphone in each hand
i called the seller and they said send them bak to the manufacturer
nothing like like making the customer responsible for a problem
i sent them back to sennheiser and asked if i could upgrade to a better headphone such as the s and that i would be happy to pay
i have to give sennheiser credit
they did call and offer to uprgrade for  plus the hd  i explained that i could get a pair of s on amazon for less than that and keep the s
that did not seem to matter to them
i guess they could not follow the logic of pay more and get lessmy suggestion is to stay away from sennheiser alltogether and take a look at ultrasone grado or pioneerunlike the ultrasones these headphones the s have an in your head sound as opposed to the much more natural sounding and accurate ultrasones
these headphones are also very tight and uncomfortable and connot be worn for longalthough i own a pair of sennheiser noise cancelling headphones which i like i prefer to give business to a company with more character
i also think there are headphones with a much superior build quality and superior sound such as the ultrasone and grado headphones
when it comes to reviews most people purchase headphones and do not compare and write a review about the only headpohone they have really listened to
the initial impression of most quality headphones is mindblowing
that was my initial mistake
now i have experiences grados ultrasones and staxs
save your money and dont buy a name buy a headphonewould love to have a screen protector that works
this cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function
after getting used to it you can make do
the dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting
outdoors it is much worse and very difficult to read even on the outdoor setting
definitely avoid this one
i want my money backive been through three of these little suckers in six weeks
all broke in exactly the same way the onoff switch drops out and eventually the unit wont power up
despite the fact that amazon and rio have been great about shipping replacements this is an essentially flawed product as corroborated by rios customer support  who today offered to ship me unit look elsewhereas many others have pointed out this is a fantastic unit  when it works
they can make a cheap dvd recorder so why cant they make a cheap and good cd recorder
im still waitingcooling issue anyhow what i did to my unit work better was to take off the cover drill enough holes in the cover to make it look like swiss cheese then add a small computer fan inside the case to blow towards the cdr inside
i run the fan off of a small wall wart ac adapter
it has worked okay since then unitl the time that i didnt plugin my noisy internal fan and sure enough it lockedup
so im assuming that there is a heating  lack of cooling issue with these units unless somebody can tell me something else
obviously unplug the unit from the ac mains before you take the cover off make sure all metal burrs are cleaned from the cover and securely mount the little cooling fan inside
make sure you have a rubber grommet or electrical tape to protect the dc wire from the ac adapter to prevent a short where it passes into the case
put it back together and see if it works
please report back here if you try adding a fan to yours and how it worked for you
no warranty expressed or implied and your mileage may vary
no responsbile for boat anchors if you break something while putting in your little fancooling unitsi have noticed no difference between the  and  minute disks
good luck i sure wish philips would make a new and improved working unit like this with proper cooling hardwareive had it for almost  years and now it just isnt working right  of the time
im ready to toss the sob
but i am struggling to figure out a reasonable cost alternative for homestudio cd mastering and reproductiondamn  thought it would last longeri was attracted to this page by the price tag on a cd recorder
after reading many of the comments of the people on here i am amazed that cd recorders are so popular
aside from the complaints about the many things that go wrong with this model im surprised about the comments that show up about how cd recording works even if it works right
for example one person said i hit the finalize button
it normally takes a little over two minutes to complete this function
amazing
negatively so
or another there are a few steps that if you mess up on any one of them you accidentally record on the wrong tracks
i recommend to those of you who like to make mixes of your favorite songs off of cd record andor tape to get a minidisc recorder
i have one by sonyamazoncom sells the price model mdsje i have a similar model
i love this thing
recording is a piece of cake
and screwups are no problem
tracks can be moved divided combined and erasedat any time
during your recording session days or weeks later and all with great ease
and its digital quality recording direct digital from cds
so dont mess with wasted cdrs that one mistake and theyre toast or even the inconveniences of cdrw recording for only price you can get a quality sony minidisc recorder and minidiscs are pretty cheap too
plus you can record up to five hours on a minidisctry doing that on a cdri bought this cdrbk early in  and at first it was alright until everything went to hell after about  months every time i used it i always have to worry what its going to do wrong ether skip during a recordng session or maybe just go into stop mode while recording or do some other cute tricks that will cause me to lose a blank cd and speaking about blank cds it sometimes cant read cds even though the cd is made for this junk
i tried to email philips to get some help and thats totally impossible there web site dont even show anything that has to do with there audio items like it used to as if they dont want to have anything to do with these cdrs
if you called them by phone youll might get someone thats pretty good helping you but dont count on it
after getting contact with philips they had me ship the cdr to there repair center and so i did not once not twice but three times i had to ship it back for repairs because i had more problems with it then ever before and then finally i got a new one same model and it was just as bad as the first starting about the third day and up that i had it
i do not support buying this item because its really that bad as of matter of fact its totally worthless and ill tell you something after finally getting rid of this cdr i then purchased a new cdr harman kardon cdr on june  and what a hell of a different im seeing so far so good
i use it for dubbing recording off from my dss and so on and i am having no problems what so ever knock on wood
im not saying that harman kardon products is gods gift to the world because i dont know that company or there products all that good for that cdr that i now have is my first harman kardon product that i ever owned at this time its about  better then this philips cdrbk
this philips cdr is one product that needs to go back to the drawing board for a good reengineeringphilips just doesnt know what theyre doing plain and simple
i went through  different units and they all had the same problems
read some of the other reviews for the list of problems ive encountered most of them
i cant stress how bad their burners are
what a headache having to send it out just to come back with the same problemson  different units none the less
i finally demanded my money back from circuit city who i wouldnt recommend either and went with the pioneer  from tweeter who are light years better than cc and have been very happy with iti have the cd version of this model but aside from their cd capacity all philips recorders are apparently the same
i had mine for only a few months before it simply stopped recording on cdrs id been using all along
so it had to be shipped back to the factory where it stayed for  weeks
 so they could look at it
over a month later i got a call from them saying that philips cd recorders are only designed to work with philips exclusive cdr blank media
my first problem with this is that apparently nobody who sells philips recorders knows thisor they just dont tell you and philips consumer electronics themselves dont tell you in the instructions on the box or even at their helpline  number
secondly good luck trying to find any philips brand cdr blank media out there much less at a reasonable price
and even when the unit is functioning the way it should the record times are sporadic and the computer inside the unit is fickle at best
please use my unfortunate experiences with these cd recorders to your own benefit
do not spend your hardearned money on this product
im sure there are other quality cd recorders out there but i just blew my money on the wrong onebought two of these cameras to take photos for  insurance purposes
there was no flash when i took the photos so when i called the company they confirmed that was correct
when i took another shot there was a flash
needless to say nothing came out
can anyone recommend a digitalupdate   i sent the headphones to sennheiser for repair
after repair the phones exhibit the same problem
i will contact sennheiser again because i think its unacceptable for  headphones to have this problemupdate  i decided that the creaking was intolerable
i tried to make a return through amazon but that window had closed
so now i have initiated a repair at sennheiser as i think there is a manufacturing defect
very disappointingwhen i looked more closely at the problem i saw that most of the noise comes from the two joints where the earpads meet the headband
those joints are designed to rotate slightly
the rotation should be smooth as it is on my hds but in this case there are about  little hiccups in the rotation on each side
the joints are grinding and each stutter in the rotation translates as a creakinitial review  i have been using the hd for a few weeks and am disappointed to find them more than a little annoying unlike my hd pair
first they seem too tight  press too hard around my ears
i have tried bending them wide open carefully but that hasnt improved how they feel
second there is a lot of structural noise conveyed into my head through my bones  noise from the ear pads and from the headband
if i yawn with them on theres a little cascade of noise
if i move my head at all there is noise
the tight fit may be exacerbating this
i am wondering if different ear pads would improve the situation
maybe memory foam
i dont recall that other people reported this problem so im surprised by it
it is really distracting and its not what i expect from a  set of headphonesi have had this unit di for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted herei upgraded to the newest firmware  because i needed the ipsec protocol that the  didnt have and it seems to work fine until i tried to access netflixcom
the unit totally halts
all lights stay on and the unit cannot be found through its configurator
i have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running againi called tech support and they told me to call netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests
i told him that netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware
and it shouldnt be the case since i was able to access netflix with the  firmware
who knows what other site it cannot access
so to the recycling bin it goesi owned a di briefly
the dhcp function worked fine and it seemed relatively reliablebut my primary need was for the firewall function
i wanted to protect an http server so i set up the di to pass port  requests to my web serverthat worked fine too until i realized that the dis settings are easily hacked from outside the firewall
thats because the di may be configured via telnet from outside the firewall and its password is inherently insecure
get this the password is limited to six characters its transmitted in the clear and the di allows unlimited attempts with the wrong password without even a delay between attemptsthat means the most simpleminded script kiddie can just run through hundreds of thousands of passwords until he gets in and then he can give himself and the rest of the world unlimited access to your lana secondary concern is that computers inside the firewall cant connect to computers outside the firewall via microsofts quotvpnquot pptp protocol
i need that too
purportedly the competing linksys device works with pptp and its only a bit more expensivethe di is cheap
if you dont need its firewall features or pptp go for iti had one of these dlink di  and had endless intermittent problems with it  the connection was just flakey is the best way to describe italso there was a big security hole perhaps fixed by now  in that its admin telnet port was fixed at  visible from outside the firewall and vulnerable to a bruteforce attack as there was no delay in password guess attempts no login username required and the password was limited to  characters
these are quotrookie mistakesquot and disqualify dlink from serious consideration as a network vendor
the stuff is just too complicated to trust someone who doesnt really know what theyre doingi ended up sending the thing back not to amazon another vendor and buying the linksys etherfast unit which costs a bit more but is rock solid and includes a couple of switched ethernet ports to boot
several of my friends use that with success
save yourself some time and buy the right thing in the first placemy onboard lan went out on a gigabyte motherbaord
darn right
the way the connectors go the metal outside would have to be inside let alone go through my motherboard before it would connect
i of course sat there trying to figure it out and realized it wouldnt work so i gave my ups uncle the package with a return label and sent it back
i would not recommend this unless your motherboard is upside down where the smaller part of the pci port is closer to the outside of the shelljust long enough to convince me i didnt need the receipt therefore no return possible
and any one who has a problem has to jump through hoops to get it fixed by dlinkdlink makes lowend nics
my problem with them is why theyre made so  awfully
quality is so inconsistent
their help desk is indifferent to the  cards many installation problems
dlinks diagnostics work only in  dos
skip this onei have a g tower mac that did have a built in ethernet
unfortunately a lightening strike took out the port and i was forced to get a pci card to replace the port
the first card i bought was the dlink dfetx
i was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with macs and that the minimum requirement was os they lied
os  is the maximum for this card
for most people it wont work with  and up
dlink has no driver for  or higher only   a google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with   i couldnt
i tried several different drivers some users recommended a driver from realtek and none workedits my guess and totally a guess that this card is really only for older macs that are limited to   dlink doesnt seem to have any intention of supporting modern macsthis is the second dlink product ive used the first was a cable modem and ive been disappointed both times
i cant speak for windows users but this company doesnt deserve mac businessif your a palm user dont bother spending the money on a windows cd devicehow tough is it
the e has a great display the only reason this review has  star but the battery cf and synch doors are so thin  and fragile youll be calling casio up within a week to get replacements
the whole unit seems so fragile that im afraid to stand up from my chair  while holding itpc synchronization the unit also syncs very slowly  with your pc compared to palm devices
it can take a long as a half hour  to sync the e even with all serial ports setup for their fastest  speeds
the pc synchronization application activesync routinely locks up  in windows   you have to open task manager and close  processes to  bring it up again
very very badfeatures there is nothing additional  that the e provides except for the great color screen that palm  devices do not provide at  the cost and reliability
why i ever thought  this was an upgrade was beyond mesupport there is no documentation  physical that comes with the unit
just a quickstart guide which is  more quick than start
microsofts site for supporting pocketpc is either  not there or so bad that it cannot be found
support from casio is the  same if not worseapplications application installation is tedious and  difficult
you need to go to multiple locations to install a single  application which makes this device much harder than any of the palm  devices
also there is really nothing available on the e that isnt  available cheaper on palm devicesi was very excited to get my e
now im very excited to get my money back
sorrylooks nice yes
but that is about where it ends
tuning is very difficult because the turns ratio between the thumb wheel and tuning capacitor is too course
just a small rotation of the thumb wheel causes too much change of the tuning capacitor making it hard to hit the center point of a signal
since am tuning is nonlinear the effect is more pronounced at the high end of the am band
also a typical pair of headphones with a stereo plug will not fit the radios earphone jack
this is because both the radio and headphone jack are mono not stereo
sadly for just a few cents more per unit this could have been a very enjoyable stereo radio that works with existing stereo headphones
as it is its little more than a childs toy
on a positive note the use of two aa cells rather than the typical  volt battery indicates a well designed and efficient circuit
this should enhance battery life as well as replacement cost efficiency
summary impossible to use with stereo headphones
ok for use as a cheap emergency radio to be kept with emergency supplies etc
but i would not recommend for every day usesoon after purchase the onoffvolume switch went bad
evidently some loose connection inside
if i press downward on the dial i can usually get the radio to come on but obviously this is a real pita
i looked inside to see if i could fix it but couldnt see where the problem was
aghhmy comments reflect judgements made on the copy i recived
a working model was not judged
the item recived had a loud audio whisle when in the playback mode
efforts to contact the supplier proved to be fruitless so the item was returnedthe recorder worked ok but seemed to be made very cheaply with a great deal of plastic
after having it for a year in which i used it but not a lot it now makes a clicking sound when it plays
im sure it wont last much longer
i would rather pay more and have an item work
i can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deterioratei bought this to transfer tapes to cds
however what they claim is a headphone port does not fit any standard earphone jack
its meant to attach to speakers not headphonesmaybe my set was defective but its not worth returning
there was static and poor sound
the fit on my head was too tight
i tossed these in the trashi tried two pairs of these headphones from amazon and had to return both as defective
it sounded like there may have been a short in each pair of these headphones
when plugged into my iphone or ipad the volume was horrible as if at the end of a long tunnel and when twisting the plug tons of static blasted in my ears at full volume with an occasional clip of music also at full volume
i could never get the plug in a place where the music came through at full volumei have to believe this is the headphones as the stock microphoneheadphones that came with the iphone work fine as well as a pair of vmode earbuds
they work fine with no static no matter how much i twist the plugconsidering all the positive reviews for these i have to wonder if they recently underwent a design change andor i got headphones from a defective batch
either way im giving up on themreading impressively positive reviews here i purchased two of them
unfortunately i was disappointed by sound reproduction of theses headphones
the sound is very weak compared to quite a few other equally priced headphones
if i press them on my ears then i get a mediocre sound
it lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly
i got what i paid forthe sound is just fair  cheap sony headphones sound much better
and despite purchasing these through amazon prime the seller was going to let me return them after i paid shipping and reshelfing fees which together added up to more than the headphones
i had purchased two sets and this return applied to only the unopened set
now i have two worthless headphonesthis  cord is about  long
i am using this on a desktop at work and its useless since the plug is on the back of the pc
my old headphones had a cord at least x as longif you use a laptop or phone it will work for you but not for any desktop with plug in the backthe sound is good
for the priceheadphones you might find at the dollar store
they are cheap because they are cheaply made
too big for any of the  of us in my family and the ear pieces are too small to fit over an average adults ear
dont be misled by these other positive reviews i would be surprised if you were happy with these headphonesthese headphones delivered adequate sound for the moneyfor about one week
after that the right channel went deadthis wasnt one week of grueling sweating workingoutinthegym torture
this was one week of old guy sitting very very still in a chair listening to music
and stillpshht
the darn thing crapped out on mefor the price theres no point in trying for a returnnor much hope that i can make a repair
so even though they didnt cost much it hurts to be adding them to the landfill
other reviews indicate that this has been an ongoing problem with these headphones
im really disappointed that panasonic couldnt add another fraction of a pennys worth of rubber to reinforce the cord and protect the wiringwow
i actually had to throw these away
the sound was fine but i could not get comfortable when i wore them
maybe the plastic was deformed
i dont know
maybe i just have a wierd head
ha
they would twist on my head and would not lay flat on my ears
anyway i just flat out threw them out
couldnt wear them
sorry for bad reviewbut its the truthi give this headphone  stars mainly for the price
its clearly not a star headphone but for the price its definitely worth itamazingly this  headphone has better bass than a  pair of headphones i got last year sometime
its the best bass youll find in a headphone this cheap guaranteed
i defy you to find betterthe actual sound quality is ok
its very low power
if youre accustomed to listening to your music on volume  lets say youll need it on volume  or  with these headphones
however when you do it gives a nice rich bass sound a below average midrange and a below average treblelike i said for  and free shipping thanks to amazon prime this was a nobrainer and maybe the best  i ever spent on headphones
this is a spare set for when i forget my other ones i have  headphones
i lose headphones and sit on them or break them so often its nice to have this one aroundbut in realistic terms if youre rating this in terms of sound regardless of price id give these headphones a  out of update   after only  short months of use my left speaker rattles rendering the headphones virtually useless
i actually only used the headphones maybe  or  times before they blew
thats  per use
garbagei returned this because the headphone jack didnt connect well with my samsung smart phone
i use the phone with several other sets of headphones and dont have this problem with any of them
if i compare the plug with the other headphones that work i cant see a difference so im assuming that its minor but enough to cause  a problemi bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap
while the sound is good the fit is terrible
both failed within four monthslikely due to stress on the cords
they also dont have a volume control and they are not good for television watching if thats what you had in mind
i believe they are under warranty but at this price its not worth the postage to send them to sonyi was very pleased with my  headphones since the sound quality was actually pretty good and thought that id beat the odds and gotten a good pair of quality headphones that would be with me for a while
alas and alack it was not meant to be
about  months of regular use led to the demise of the headphones which apparently should be treated with great care and attention
the earpieces came off one at a time and then the arm broke offuntil this happened i would have sworn that they were not only a  cheap piece of  but now its clear that in this day and age there are no bargainsyou just get what you pay fori bought  sets of these for my kids to watch videos on a trip
theyre much too large for a childs head the volume is too low i didnt mind this for my kids the sound quality at its best is still poor and there is horrible static every time the plug moves in the headphone jack
theyre cheap but i wouldnt bother with these even if they were freejunk
these things lasted no time with my girls mp player
all she did was ride her bike and listen to them but the wires are so thin they constantly were shorting out
i would find the short fold it up and tape it in position to work for her but after a couple fixes i just bought her some better ones
she likes the new ones
they didnt come from amazonhi
if i buy that will make mistake
because i will not be able to hear the loud enough
i rather have the loud headphone because im deaf
i always use the headphone since i was  years old
do you have the loud headphone
thank you very much
have a great week
vickiwell i had one and i sold one
never again would i buy a pocket pc even if the price were cut in half
this is one fairly useless peice of equipment in the scheme of things
ms reader is a joke as the version on the ppc is basically incompatible with the format of most books currently available beyond public domain booksand there is no fix in sight in the near term
music
even with usb expect long downloads and only acceptable qualitynot a true music lovers delight
some tape players sound better
as to business usenot worth the hype
iffy and slow writing capabilities with cumbersome calendar and contact list functionality
and battery life
forget about it
i give this a  rating because i did find the storage of documents useful to a point especially for editing speeches on the road
otherwise the hype doesnt tranlsate into reality
and movieswhy would you on such a small screen
i have found the wireless web on my cellphone more versatile and useful  get directions restautrant recommendations and menus news games avantgo newspaper and magazine articles even poetry and ebooks in wap format if i want them with video coming soon
and it costs almost nothing as well as being a heck of a lot easier
dont waste your time or money on one of these things  i am glad i triedbut even happier i got rid of it
i feel free againmy bike light went out and i replaced the toshiba batteries with these
the light didnt work
these are weak batteries and for bike lights dont use themi added these batteries to an order of a few other things and didnt realize that they were going to ship this separately from circuit city
make sure if you pick this that you are getting something else from cc or else you will end up like me
with a huge box you could fit  tom clancey novels in the box shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteriesat first i bought this item it worked okay and was better then having to plug my camera in all the time but after starting to conflict with other software it would lose contact with my computer after a couple uses
i would have to reboot to reestablish contact
i ended up tossing this product
i recommend a kodak reader for your kodak camerasthe first viking reader i received had a defective eject button
the second reader would read some pc cards but not others
the third reader refused to read a second card after the first was removed
i definately like that the drive treats pc cards like removable media with no starting and stopping of card services and if you are a lucky or persistant buyer and they ship you a drive that works this would be a great dealthis component didnt work on two different computers a laptop running winxp and a desktop using windows  i had the correct drivers
when a device doesnt work with one computer i normally blame the computer
when it doesnt work on two computers i blame the product
i need a card reader but it is very unlikely i will buy anything from this manufacturer
i cant return the bloody thing so i am stuck with it and out the moneyi installed the software as described and all seemed well until i tried to read my first cf card
after downloading i ejected the card burning my fingers in the process
upon reviewing the results of the download i discovered that a number of the pictures did not transfer and were no longer on the cf card
when i called viking they informed me that they did not advertise their unit as working with windows me  obviously my mistake
when i asked how this could cause the obvious overheating they could not give an answer  but more troubling  they didnt seem to care
when i have a chance i will retry with another computer with windows  before i pack it up and send it backthere is a reason all the other converter vcrs cost over a grandwe got our first svw for two purposes a watch pal tapes b convert ntsc home videos to pal for relatives overseasregarding purpose a we were relatively satisfied
overall however the picture quality on nonconverting playback from this unit at  bucks is lower than from our regular vcr which is  years old cost  and get this wears the brand admiral
but anyway it works ok on the playback
farewell old saltb it sucks making tapes however
we were feeding ntsc hi video into it straight from the camcorder and the pal recording quality was attrocious as if it were only halfconverting the signalso we took it to an authorized repair facility while still under warranty
no change
we sent it in to the samsung facility in jersey
when we got it back it looked as if someone had literally taken a sledghammer to it
the box it came in was pristine but the faceplate was smashed in
my theorythe repair tech figured it would be easier all around if we just got our money back
which we didand then we had all these pal tapes sitting around so we bought another albeit for  less than wed first paid
same thing playback was ok recording unacceptablerecently every tape we play is filled with electronic snow and the warranty is over
crap updateafter writing the above review in  i found the solution to the snow problem among the other reviews here
since then it has functioned ok as an occasionallyused player
the admiral after  years of heavy use finally gave up the ghost this winter and moved on to its welldeserved rest
farewell old saltthis product was not in functioning condition when delivered
i worked on it and was able to shoot about half a roll before it locked up
a shameunfortunately i only have bad experience with this lensit lacks is to be a decent lens all the pictures i got with this lens were blurry
while zooming in at mm you gotta shoot at  or faster to avoid fuzzy image if shooting wo tripod right
well how can you do it if the max aperture at  mm is only 
only on a bright cloudless day
what are the chances that all of your images you will be taken on a bright sunny dayor you can use a tripod for all your imagesone good thing is the lens is rather fast when auto focusingi ended up selling it on craigslistwell the question of is this an ok lens yes and no
i did  events where i needed long focal length and this thing crapped out on me at mm no flash iso  at f   which gives super blurry pics and dont think of moving the shutter speed this thing looses so much light
but ok i tried it outside in sunny conditions well it was super dark as well shooting raw adjusting exposure in post shows to much grain for an outdoor picture in all i was not pleased with this lens and opted for the mm f yes it is worth the k price but you get what you pay forwhen it comes to a lens ont be cheap or you wont be happyreturned it in  days
just awful
poor focusing and lots of hunting for focus on my digital rebel
slowness made every shot underexposed
lens mounted to the camera losely so you could wiggle the lens
lens gave error s on the eosavoid this productupdate  purchased the canon ef mm f is usm telephoto zoom lens and it is absolutely wonderful
worth the extra money for better glass image stabilization and faster focusingfor many years i have had minolta film cameraaccessories
one thing i had learned in the  some years of buying equipment was that the minolta brand was better quality and higher priced
when i decided to go digital i did endless hours of research on the camera
i chose to get the canon d over a similar nikon
so far so good
when it came time to add accessories i did next to no homework
i bought this lens at a local camera chain store
it was affordable and had the canon name on it
in about three weeks time i dropped the lens while making a lens change at a soccer game
it stopped working
no one cared because i had dropped it
my minolta gear has most certainly been banged bruised dropped it ranges in age from  years old to stuff handed down to me from my father over  years ago
it all still works
i have since upgraded to the l series lens
i wish a salesperson at the store had taken a moment to explain that canon does in fact produce some crap
my l series lens is awesome and i would highly recommend that anyone considering this lens wait until you can afford the l series lens
this lens is sure to disappointthis item was packed fine and arrived in working order
takes too many batteries and does not get full power output as describedi cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case
i am a fast typist and it seemed that about  of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo   this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it
i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda
newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there
my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pdadont waste your money the pda holders three very flimsy support arms will not hold the pda still and the pda holder will not stay up on its own
the battery life is very short
so carry extra batteries and any where there is vibration airplane train etc
you are out of luck unless you use one hand to hold everything still
if i am going to use one hand to hold the pda then why not just use the stylicaution
mac  palm users you need a pc and windows to make it worki thought this was a great purchase for my handspring for those times when i was on the road and wanted to sync with my laptop computer
unfortunately it did not work with my visor deluxe and so far i have been unable to understand whythe trouble started when i went to sync and discovered that there was no hotsync button anywhere on the cable
unable to start the process i gave upi do not know why this thing got all those great ratings unfortunately i bought this on the strength of those reviews
it seems great when you set it up but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection very frequently
if you have an always on broadband connection dont get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the internet
its certainly the cheapest thing out there spend more and get something else
furthermore linksys tech support is nonexistent they do not respond
i had decided to return this only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now i am stuck with it
i will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash
by the way the next model up befsrport has the same problem from what i have read of other reviews
if you still want to take a chance just save the box and the receipti bought the  based on an endorsement by the authors of a book on flash photography
big mistake
first the flash head is so big youll find a hard time finding diffusers that will fit it
second the instruction manual is almost useless
next making adjustment to power is needlessly cumbersome and finally the recycle time is almost  seconds
i bought a yongnuo and found it superior in every wayvivitar used to be the goto workhorse for photographers but no more
now they are made in china and prone to high failure
the one that i bought  year ago made a snapping and crackling sound the other day and then refused to fire after that
efforts to contact the number on the warranty were fruitless the company has gone out of business and will not service its flashes
if you really want an oldschool vivi that wont fail get a  made in japan off of ebayit really would be nice if they specified which cameras these work with because this flash does not work with pentax k
the manual itself is as confusing as trying to read it in spanish
tried calling pentax customer service and ended up with indian customer nonservice
ill buy american next timei called up their support number
twice i got the answers of they are sending me an online link of the driver for two calls i made
so far i have not received any email they promised to send
the last call i was told i am going to get it within  minutes
it is not the casei am disappointed not receiving the link so far
dont know what is going on there
only hope eventually i can get a workable driveri got  loose rolls of film not as pictured in orginal fuji wrappingwithout original wrapping i cannot tell the films experation datethis is the worst underwater disposable ive ever used
out of  shots only  even developed and those were so dark you could only see blurs for the camera and  for developing a complete wasteif you buy this make sure you familiarize yourself with the lever for advancing the film  you dont want to figure it out while snorkeling
after a few shots the lever just spun uselessly
i have no idea how many shots i got  ive been reluctant to waste money on developingwe brought two of these to the galapagos and neither worked  the film advance failed us almost immediately
we would not recommend these camerasthe poor quality photographs that this camera takes will make you erase those memories even from your mind
it is better to just remember those moments and leave this camera in store
buy bubble gum insteadi had used these before and needed one for a quick scuba trip
i dont know if this one was just bad or what  but it leaked ruining the camera and all of the film
i most likely wont be purchasing these againthis film may work fine for under water or dark situations is is  speed after all but results from normal daylight photos are very poor
i wouldnt even say photos were were better than nothing
save your moneythe case was cracked and i did not notice it until i was in the water snorkeling
possibly it is a good camera but should have inspected when deliveredthis camera is almost useless underwater
it is pointless unless you have perfect conditions
it was nice to take pictures while in the water because we were not worried about dropping it but underwater no pictures came out at all
most picture were taken in middle of afternoon with plenty of light and clear water
camera was only a few inches under the ocean water and you really can not tell what is in the pictures
very blurry and dark
skip this one for underwaterif youre taking pictures in a swimming pool underwater while perfectly still
it should work for you
i bought the pack of  for cancun mexico while i was underwater taking picture of fish
about  of all the pictures were absolute trash
the fish were all blurs almost unable to see any fish at all
complete waste of time and money
i took pictures of my girlfriend underwater and she is a blur alsook  i only get  pages for 
my dvb came with  pages to start with   and the album for 
so  if i wanted  pages to use in my many albums  then it would cost me    x  refill cost
i could purchase  new dvb albums for  get  refill pages and get  binders to use for other purposes
does case logic think its customers are idiotsi bought these almost  years ago and they were wonderful as good as any ive ever had  good price too
then the inline volume control started messing up and i ended up throwing them away
dont waste your money on the possibility that that the volume control wont failbut the stitching was irregular on the front
i thought the company produced good products but i was mistaken when i bought this item
next time ill just go to bestbuy for a camera casevery disappointed
the pictures are focused incorrectly
the flash is off so that half the picture gets the flash light and the other half is in a shadow
my disposable cameras take better pictures
i was hoping for a very simple camera that took better than disposable camera quality pictures
very disappointedbetter late than never with my review i guess
you get what you pay
the price was cheap but the picture quality was very poor
even in bright outdoor situations the pictures were under exposed and grainy
really disappointed with this and we ended up buying a new camera soon afterwardsthe audio connector was very difficult to make it plug into the radio jacks
even when i got it plugged in the microphone did not work at alli threw it away
at least it was an inexpensive mistakeheres whats wrong with it people are constantly telling me that they cant hear me  the microphone is way too quiet
the phone does not use a standard  plug so you cant easily replace the headset with one that will work better
 the light that tells you which of the two lines the incoming call is on does not light constantly when a call comes in
its only on where theres actually a ringing sound but not between rings and you have to know which line is active before you can pick up there are two switches one for each line
so you have to sit and stare at the phone for several seconds until the light comes on before you can answer
i usually guess wrong when i just pick one or the other of the lines
theres no pick up whichever line is ringing button
 its very difficult to determine the position of the volume control
since the control wheel is on the side and is very smooth you cant even tell if youre moving it when you run your finger over it
 the phone does not go off hook automatically when you start dialing so you have to remember to select a line first
 theres no caller id which is obvious from the picture
i thought that this lack wouldnt be a problem but it turns out that i rely more on caller id than i had thoughtin all the phone is pretty worthless
i strongly recommend against buying iti use and love my plantronics bluetooth headset for my cell phone but this t for use in my office is terrible
as others have said the talk volume is far too low while the dialing tones are painfully loud
to top this off i just called plantronics tech support to see if they could suggest some way to make the talk volume higher and i was told they have not had any other complaints that the volume is too low
i then asked if they knew that the dial tones were far too loud and i was told that they had no complaints about that either
dont they every read the reviews herethis t is going back to amazon
does anyone have a suggestion for a good headset for a wired telephonealthough this device would be nice to have it is only the beginning
there are many improvements to be made
first of all this unit it too big and heavy
i am waiting for a circular unit that can fit in your pockey like some of the new sony and philips cd players
the next problem is the display
what good is having access to  hours worth of songs if you cant even see the title of the song you want
the unit could also use a hold button to prevent buttons from being accidently hit and a resume button
with a lack of options and poor design this hastily designed product needs some work
the next generation of cd mp players will include the round pocket size designs indiglo backlit displays which read and display id tags the ability to search within songs and many more options dealing with playback
these things will come at a higher price however
i can definately gaurentee that no new players that have all these features will be  but they will be worth it
save your money and be patient
you can email me and thank me laterwhen i bought my wireless logitech trackball that looks just like this a few years ago i paid 
the price on this one is absolutely nutsi bought this because of the design
however the mouseware software does not work on a mac
it conflicts with apples software and logitech has not updated it or fixed the problems
unfortunately all manufacturers of mice provide poor support  for mac so if you want to use this item you will have to pay an additional  for the shareware program quotusb mouse overdrivequot to get it to workthis product does not work with mac os  and above though there is no indication of this in the literature
logitec tells me that it is discontinuing the item and will not update the software
be aware of thisive been using traditional optical mouse devices
but due to small desk space i wanted to try trackball devices
the idea was that trackball device stays in one place so i wouldnt need much desk space
i got the logitech cordless trackman and man am i ready to go back to good old mouse devices
cons after a days use i am feeling pain in my thumb and fore arm
classic carpal tunnel symptoms while the trackball is quick in movements it is difficult to work with when you need to be very precise
so clicking on small buttons requires multiple attempts click n drag  drag n drop actions are quite tricky
not as intuitive as with traditional mouse devices the device comes with a sensor that is huge
almost the size of a mouse itself
as i said i wanted to reduce the space required on my desk and i ended up having gained very littlepros its a large device
good for people with large hands
provides a lot of support easy connectivity
im using windows xp
plug n playi have tendinitis which prevents me from using a mouse on the right side even though im right handed
i must use a trackball on the left sidelogitech has no excuse for leaving out lefthanded people
it is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sides
i dont see another comparable wireless trackball in logitechs product line that would work for lefthandedive had a corded logitech trackball for  years i think
loved it
recently i purchased a laptop and wanted to continue with a trackball but one i could take with me in my backpack
so after looking at all the trackballs i could find i chose this one
i had thought the mouse was a bit large but i thought the trade off was worthwhile
and the receiver looked tiny on the box
i imagined it would be similar to the usb sticks the other cordless mice havebut to my surprise the receiver is huge
its half the size of the mouse itself and is arguably larger than most cordless mice by themselvesso i give it a  rating
mostly for false advertisement
there isnt even a picture of the receiver on this page and on the box its about  of an inch long not its true x inches
the ones ive checked out in stores didnt have the receiver out and showing
so im pretty disappointed
had i bought this locally i would return it
this is not a cordless mouse you pack with youi have a corded version of this track ball that i use with my desktop computer and i thought i might use this with my laptop
the usb connector that sends out the signal is too big and in the waythey say this is a cordless trackman but this is not a cordless product
there is a  foot cord on the receiver
and the receiver is huge
it is time for a receiver to be the same as a jump drive  no cord and small
this receiver and cord is a real big nuisance
it is constantly getting tangled with the laptop power cord and the cat  cablesince every ad hides the fact this product has a corded receiver like this  im not sure how you can shop for one that doesnt have a long cord and big receiver online
seems that is where going to a store excels  when online selling is not forthcoming about the productive owned  of these and none of them lasted more than  months
thankfully logitech put a  yearwarranty on them
prepare yourself to be constantly sending yours back to get a new one ever fewmonthsmy mother gave me a palm m for my birthday in december  and i soon fell in love with it and carried it everywhere
within  days it began to just totally shut down and refuse to turn on
i could hard reset hot sync and get another day out of it and then it would die again
i returned it and replaced it with an m
it lasted  days and is now doing the same thing
returned it yesterday and am researching for a different brand
stay away from palmi have no idea whether this works because most etrex models does not include my etrex vista cxamazon andor garmin should make the limits of the models this is meant for clearer in their adthough shown as an accessory for the garmin model i ordered at the same time it had the incorrect fitting so could not be used and had to be returnedthe product description says that this charger works for all garmin etrex models oopps
except for the legend cx which is the one i happen to have so it was an expensive mistake for mei ordered an etrex  case and bicycle mount in a package however the mount will not fit the etrex not even close
i went on the garmin web site and got the part number for the correct mount and reordered from amazon
i hope this on fits the as others have stated and i didnt see until after ordering not compatible with etrex
i think the title and description should be more completeif you have a cx based etrex model legend of vista the back cover plate will not accommodate the microsd card
so instead of this id recommend getting a ram mountram mounting systems handlebar mount for garmin etrex venture c legend c vista c venture cx legend cx vista cxor do it yourself and build your own mount see instructablescomdoesnt fit the garmin vista hcx
you are better off investing in a ram mount than you are this timeas many have mentioned before this product does not work with the etrex vista
i have the vista hcx and was pretty excited to get this mount only to find out the cover doesnt fit the back of the gps unit
i wish i had read all the star reviews before ordering this item its disconcerting to see that amazon lists this item as compatible with the vista when in reality its notunfortunately like many others i did not read the reviews here before ordering this bicycle mount for my garmin vista etrex hcx
the battery cover for the garmin etrex models that use a micro sd memeory card is shaped differently and this mount does not fit
i notified amazon and i hope they update their informationwhat a disappointment
the battery cover does not work on a etrex venture cx model
what a disappointment
the cx has a flash card slot on the upper left which requires a notch in the cover
this one does not have the notch so it will not fit
i also do not have the oring mentioned by the other reviewer so i am not sure if it will seal  on regular units anywaywhat a bummer i threw away the packaging before i actually tried to mount it on the bicycle anyway
what a bummeronce again the description said that it would fit the etrex  and it most certainly did not
really disappointedfor cx owners if a different cover were supplied it would be a good product
the cx models are designed to hold the microsd card under the cover
the replacement back supplied with this product does not fit the unit
garmin could have easily molded a back for this mount that would accomodate both the newer and older versions of the etrex line with a rubber gasket seal
when you purchase a cx series gps there is a supplied addon mounting clip for the cover that protrudes and catches items when carrying the gps off the mountit said it would fit the etrex  but it didnt
was not impressed at all
really they should make sure that the description tells what models it fits  unless any case is completely dirt proof no part of the case should be able to touch a units screen
including a clear window
dirtdust will get in and will get rubbed by the window to scratch the screen
rather one should apply a stickon screen protector and then not cover the screen further
the clear window is just another source of reflections and as others have said haze or fog
i suppose it could be unsewn removed and the case significantly resewn
just cutting the window out would leave scratchy edges
this case is too tight for the legends thickness  c  max
it can be forced to stretch over but batteries do have to be changed and then that is not convenient
inserting my legend with its screen protector started to scrape the protector offim glad some other people like this case but it doesnt work for mei felt this item was a waste of money and i sent it back
my gps buttons were hard to use in this device and the velcro looks like it will wear out fast
i took some advice from other reviews and just put a smart phone skin protector on my gps cost 
now my screen is protected and not bulky like it was in this case
save your moneyi bought one and eventually the primary mouse button no longer worked
i got a replacement sent free of charge but it now malfunctions as wellthe cursor now disappears and reappears from a different part of the screen
while playing first person shooter games the character spins wildly out of controlthis never happened with my other optical mouse made by microsoftfrom the minute i bought this  installed it would go on  off constantly
it must have a loose wire inside
i will replace with something better
i do have an handheld cobra since  that still works greati replaced my compact midland cb with the uniden prow because i wanted a frontfiring speaker
but all i can get from this cb is engine noise
in fact the electrical interference is so bad i have to turn my squelch all the way to the right to block it out rendering my cb completely useless
the noise is electrical interference coming through the air  not just from my own engine but from every car that i pass on the roadi installed a highquality antenna cable and an rfi filter but that didnt help at all
so the cause of the problem is either my antenna or the radio itself
i didnt notice the problem with my midland cb so the prow seems to have lousy internal shielding
other people have also mentioned in their reviews that the radio picks up a lot of engine noise so please consider your purchase of this cb very carefullyedit it is also interesting to note that uniden america site sells this radio at a lower price than what amazon charges
even at a lower price i would not get this radio
it is not a good design and the board is really cheaply made
if you open up the radio to tune it there only few pots that you can adjust not like the older unidens which can be made to scream
keep looking dont waste your money on this radio youll be glad that you didnt get itwhen i first purchased this radio i thought it was a good idea to have the noaa weather channels and the front firing speakers
for starters the  noaa channels were okay but you really need all  if you do a lot of driving
next the front firing speakers were a good idea but it wasnt loud enough that sometimes while driving i had hard time understanding the locals
i think the older speaker design of having it on the bottom cover was the best design for cb radios
finally it picks up lots of noise in the car alternator whine ignition noise even electrical noise from other vehicles on the highway
i first thought it was the antenna or maybe even the grounding
but when i switched it out to another radio that i bought used the cobra gtl from taiwan it was night and day
i really wished that uniden put nbanl noise blankerautomatic noise limiter on this radio
range was another issue it has hard time getting out
it receives okay but it had hard time getting out maybe even about  miles even with a wilson  antennaif youre serious about getting a good cb radio i recommend used radios such as uniden pcxl which is my favorite as it is the most compact and has awesome performance uniden proe uniden grant xl philippines or cobra  gtl taiwan or philippines
those all have single side band ssb frequencies so youre really getting  channels instead of the 
when summer comes you can talk to people all over the country on skip toolastly older radios will almost always be better than this one even the uniden xl
if you really need weather consider spending the extra money and get the uniden  elite with backlit display it has all the bells and whistles including nbanl channel noaa weatherthe kit arrived hanging out of the plastic bag it was mailed in no hard box dirty bent and out of shape
total waste of time sent it back immediately and bought a kit from home depot insteadi cannot complain about how the rc worked when it worked
it did its job as expected but canons warranty is not a long one and they are not into courtesy warranty
sorry about that
i am more than happy with my canon cameras but im getting the opteka rc at half the priceits a part of my camera
i have always a spare because its not very secure to the camera
i lose them a lot
but is a great eye peace to usethis eb eye cup appeared as a search result when doing a canon d eyepiece search of course thinking it was for the d i ordered itquite irresponsible for the seller to not list the compatible canons this eyepiece fits and only statescompatible with some canon eos cameras  lame
so bewarethis flash cord shares the defect of its cheapo imitators
the plastic part that attaches to the metal arm breaks easily
yes the flash will still work  you just will be unable to safely attach the flash cord to the offcamera flash arm
when it breaks you will be embarrassed as your expensive canon flash goes crashing toward the ground
lucky you the cord is too short for the flash to actually be harmedcanon makes a more expensive flash cord of the same length
its sinfully expensive
this one is just a marketing ployi have extremely mixed feelings about the canon company
why do they have to be both the best and the worstits a nice bag if you dont have larger lenses
its rated to hold  bodies and  lenses
i currently have a dgrip ex ii  fl is and then tamrons   and  lenses
thats full to the max
i contacted canon to find out what lenses it was rated for they considered the  lens even to be larger than what it was designed for
they designed it and rated it for two bodies no grips no external flashes and the lenses are all small prime lenses like the   and mms
they couldnt list  different focal length lenses that would fit in the bagso why do they say that
i had to special order this bag from my shop so there are no returns and canon is sticking to their word that it holds what they say so they are doing anything about it eitherif you can live with the cameragrip flash and  lenses then its a great bag but if you are getting it to hold anywhere near the gear its rated for go with something else
if anyone wants mine just email meim selling it on here for cheap nowi have a d mm lens and a mm lens
it does not fit with my mm attached
would not recommend to anyoneyou can not fit what the product info states
try it
this is a joke
you can not put more than one camera body with two lenses or two camera bodies with one lens in this bag
when you do you are forcing the camera in
you cant even put the camera with the lens attached to the body and add another lens in the bag
another thing you can not zip the inside pocket where the manual is suppose to be stored
funny thing this is a canon bag which cant even hold most canon items including the manual
returned mine and ordered the larger one eg modeli was waiting on this flash unit and then i got a message informed me that they canceled the order i ordered this flash as a replacement for a ex that i was borrowing from a good colleague
the minute i opened i had the ominous feeling that it was going to be a disappointment
indeed
the very first test shots were incredibly telling as to how lousy and shoddy this flash is
first it does not swivel so you can kiss your hopes for bounce flash goodbye
second its lacks punch and power
in many of the informal tests i performed the builtin flash of my camera and even that of a pointandshoot i have lying around the studio is more powerful
i repacked it and sent it back
got a ex and am nothing but satisfied
in short stay away from this flash
in this case you wont even get what you paid foravoidi have been using the remote with the cable which works extremly good besides that the cable is somewhat shortim very disappointed with this remote as it only works if the remote is very close to the camera and if its pointed in a specific wayafter just using it for a couple of times it doesnt work at all anymore
im not sure if its the batteries but i would think so as i just bought iti would not recommend this remote to anyonefantastic idea
works great about a quarter of the time
cant figure out why the engineers wouldve designed this thing this way
im referring mainly to the fact that for it to be seen by the camera you need to be standing directly in front of it aiming in the precisely right place
also what the hell were they thinking requiring the camera to be in self timer mode especially when self timer mode times out in a minute or two
when trying to wrangle a large group of people to pose for a shot it can easily take longer than the time limit before it kicks back over to regular shooting modei was delighted with this product when i first received it and played around with a few self portraits but after a few months of frustration have completely abandoned it in favor of the wired remotethe rebel wireless remote is not a good device
i see there are several reviews that praise the device which i dont understandthe device has a very weak transmitter that only work with line of sitethe device does work but not well
i like watching people hold the remote and try to fire the camera
it looks something like a conductor conducting the la philharmonic in the  overture
its ir port is like a laser beam
you better point the device right at the ir port on your camera
forget taking a photo while standing behind the camera with the remote
if you people already own this device you know what im talking about
very weak sauce
very cheap device
a corded plug in remote is the only way to gothis is a piece of junk
i hope you believe it or you will end up buying two remotes
not to mention that the rebel remote has no features or controls
my corded remote allows me to set any feature on my eos as well as intervals and much more
i use my remote for time lapse photographygood product but will not connect with canon d
returningthe product description needs to state the compatible cameras for purchasebad ordering to begin with on my part but i ordered this only to find that comparable remotes were available at a fraction of the cost
this one didnt even have the features i was looking for and was way more expensive
i sent it back right out  of the boxi bought the ebookman to use as a pda and for easy access to the physician desk reference
even when not in use the product goes thru batteries faster than i can recharge them
i have had it replaced once and still cannot replace the batteries without losing all the data
i certainly would not but another onei would recommend not buying this product
ive had mine for about a year and a half
since the operating system is not hardwired you have to download it from the franklin website any time the batteries wear down
on sevral occassions the franklin website was either down or being serviced making it impossible to get the os
when everything is operating well it takes upwards of  or  minutes from a dialup to download
the software supplied is also a bear to work with
this is probably one of the most poorly thought out electronic devices ive ever owned
am looking at other readers and when i find one i like the franklin  is going in the garbagebasically this product is a ripoff on consumers
i am sticking with my palm m which is much more versatile and a real pda not like this toy as well as a fine ebook device
following is a copy of a note i sent on to mobipocket the ebookman ebook reader of choice now and copied franklin on
too bad because this was a great idea that had extremely poor execution
save your precious dollars folksa note to mobipocket and franklinhi
this is just a note on my experience with an ebookman
sad to say i owned an ebookman for all of  hours before returning it to an accommodating store that gladly took it back and said they would not carry it anymore
what a terrible product
not only did i go through two sets of aa batteries in less than  hours but also the responsiveness was so slow i waited nearly  to  seconds for your reader to open a book from the sd card
and the backlight was less than useless
worse the selection of current books is virtually nili love your reader but you should know that it works far better on the palm than on this toy device
i get a full refund thank goodness but had to tell you that i think you are hurting yourselves being associated with this product which is basically a fraud on knowing consumers
i bought it for the larger screen but nothing else about it is worth anywhere near what franklin is charging even at the reduced price
frankly i would not give this to my children it would be an insult to their intelligence to have to fool around with the devicetake this for what it is worth but i will see you on my palm from now onthanksgreat product
the data loss is ok  there is room for an expandion mmc card so no bigee
not bad for the money compared to other pdasthe opnly problem is mine wont turn on anymore
and is too old for them to replace
reset and what ever else they suggested never helped eitheri just wish they made this unit a little more solidivnji received the ebookman  as a gift last year and have been frustrated with it ever since
my main complaint is uploading the operating system into the unit because the unit doesnt come with a cd
ever since i changed my pcs operating system to windows xp the ebookman has be come a bigger nightmare to operate
because the unit doesnt come with a cd one must download the operating system
for some reason the unit doesnt remain connected to the computer during the download of the operating system this leave the computer hanging
when you attempt to cancel the download the program will not respond so you have to use ctrlaltdelete to end the program which causes more problems on xp
when you attempt to turn off the computer after using ctrlaltdelete ebookmans program somehow prevents the computer from shutting down one has to manually turn off the computer and then watch the computer do a scan disk when it rebootsseveral attempts which causes you to reboot the computer manually each time has to be made before ebookman finally downloads the os without disconnecting prematurely before the download is complete
then ebookman has to download the new os to the computer
again ebookman disconnects prematurely during the middle of the download which hangs up the program and which hangs up xp when you try to turn off the computer so that you can try againwhen the os is finally uploaded ebookman works great except that battery life is short
i purchased last year a power pack which is suppose to run the ebookman from my wall socket
i thought that when the unit was hooked up to the power pack that the batteries would not drain
guess what the batteries still drain even when the unit is plugged in although they drain at a much slower ratemy last complaint is customer sevice
last year you could contact franklin by email if you had problems
this year franklin discontinued email support so now you have to make a long distant phone call which isnt an  number if you want supporti dont think that franklin really engineered this product well
spend the extra dollars and buy a palm or a sonyi have had my ebookman for over a year now and i have read all of the reviews on this site and others
the pros and cons seem to be pretty accurately stated by other reviewers so i will not waste anybodys time repeating what has already been said
however there seems to be something which has been missed in other reviews
what ive noticed is that most other reviewers seem to be avid readers who use their ebookmans everyday
and for those users the complaint that i have is probably simply a minor annoyance
but for users like myself who bought the ebookman for the occassional business trip or long flight there is a ridiculously inconvenient feature that makes it almost impossible to use
that is if you leave your ebookman off for any extended period of time the batteries continue to drain until they are completely dead
yes you heard me
this unit uses up the batteries even when it is off
for example i would regularly put in a fresh set of batteries and within  weeks they would be completely dead without ever having turned on the unit
at first i thought there was something wrong with my unit
but a call to franklins technical support confirmed my worst fear this is the way the units were designedbut wait  i havent even gotten to the punch line yet
when the batteries run out all of the data is lost  including the operating system
this is because the unit has no internal battery backup
it just uses a capacitor which only holds a smal charge for a few seconds supposedly just long enough to change batteries when the battery indicator is running low
but if your batteries run out its byebye data
so for the casual user what that means is that you end up having to reinstall the entire operating system and all of your titles every time you turn the unit on assuming you do not use it an a very regular basis
this by the way is no short task although in fairness to franklin it is a simple process
for me this problem renders the ebookman totally useless
now im sure there are avid readers or frequent travelers who would love to have what otherwise would be classified as a pretty decent reader for a very decent price
but for me it is just a paperweightin summary if you use the ebookman everyday i guess you could find a use for it
but if you plan to let it rest  even for a relatively short period of time  i would look elsewherehad trouble with this model from the time i took it out of the box
after loading the software from the cd my pc crashed several times before i could finally get the software to load correctly
then i couldnt connect to the internet site to download the os software needed to use the reader why didnt they load this at the factory 
its now been two days and that site is still not available per franklins tech services who said quotjust keep trying were working on itquot i hope so cause this piece of junk is going back to the store tomorrow if i cant download the softwareeverything you read in the other reviews is correct
the product is buggy and does not work anywhere near as advertised
pda users seem satisfied with it but i bought it as an ebook  big mistake
even if they had decent software to load your text into franklin format their quottoolsquot run under a unix emulator on windows badly and even if it read html files you can download it quick enough but youll wait twenty minutes after you click the button to see the text the screen is too small and battery life too short
just say no
this is not an ebookafter owning the ebm  for two years reading several books on it and really wanting to like it i finally gave up in total frustration and threw it in the trash
the main problem is the operating systemwhich must be downloaded anytime the batteries run low
what you learn very quickly is that the unit drains the batteries even when it is turned off
so when the batteries die you lose everything that youve had on the unit addresses books notes even the operating system
on a dialup connection it takes  minutes or so to get the os online and then resynchronize everything so that you get your files back and get the darn thing running again
if you were in the middle of reading a book when it went down its very time consuming to find your place again
while it comes with a cd with the os if you have gotten a book from a vendor different from franklins distributors you sometimes run into little problems of compatibility that have to be corrected
i began to add up all the time id spent messing around with this thing and finally decided that it was a massive waste of time and an aggravation nobody needs in their lives
i was surprised to discover that two other friends had given up on this product long before i did
i wonder how many ebookmans have found their final resting place in landfills
franklin owes consumers an apology for this illconceived piece of junki had purchased this mainly because of the price and the fact that franklin promised the ability to read microsoft reader format would be made available
a promise that was not kept
mobipocket format and html formats could be read only and at that time there were not many books by known authors being brought out in those two formats
the battery life was very low and when the battery ran down you lost all of your content which meant you had to go thru the irritating process of downloading the operating system and contents all over again  which got very old very quickly
installing batteries was not easy because if you didnt do it quickly enough the device was wiped clean and you had to go thru the downloading of the operating system again
there were too many times that i was in the middle of reading a book and had to change the batteries only to have the device wiped clean  which meant i had to wait until i got back home in order to reload the operating system
the device was very small and the print was hard to read
if you used the backlight it ran the battery down faster  which from what i stated above you definitely didnt want to have happen
within a short period the wheel used to page up or down broke and i had to order another device which entailed reloading the operating system and content
franklin website does not even offer the ebookman anymore and refers you to another online company
tech support was absolutely nonexistant for this product and since franklin is not selling it directly i have a feeling tech support would be completely nonexistant now
this product is something i would not recommend to anyone
if you wish to have something that is user friendly reliable and great to just read ebooks  i would highly recommend the ebookwise readeri bought this dvd player on october   based on pioneers reputation and on the reviews id read here at amazoncom
it worked great  for all of forty days
at that point it stopped playing dvds altogether
it simply locks up after  seconds of play and nothing but a complete powerdown will get it moving again
and even then it only moves for another  secondsim now in the process of receiving warranty repair service from a pioneerauthorized service center which is essentially a local independent contractor approved by pioneer
the customer service folks ar pioneer were average  not overly dismissive but not overly helpful eitheri bought the dv thinking id have a nice little unit on which i could watch my budding dvd collection over the holidays
instead ive had the headache of driving the unit to a repair center  and i have no idea when its coming back
this unit may be fantastic when it works as intended
but not all of them do
id at least consider another brand before opening your walleti bought my first dvd player panasonic several years ago and it was very finicky with certain disks the matrix in particular
i would see a lot of noise or the player would freeze altogether
i read other peoples reviews unfortunately not the ones in amazoncom and it seemed like the pioneer dv would be a good choice to play problem disks
right from the beginning when i bought it the player would make loud pops when i switched audio modes particularly if i wanted dts
once i changed modes the player would play the rest of the disk without any problems
after several months i started to experience some freezing when playing some dvds
eventually just after a year it would start to play up to the menu and then freeze altogether with every disk
i could play the same disks on other players with no problems
i brought it to an authorized pioneer dvd shop and they diagnosed it to be a defective chip
they said it would cost me to repair  i bought this model in december  as a family christmas gift based on reviews i read here
we used it lightly  probably playing one dvd movie a week from then until last month
the machine no longer responds predictably to either the remote with fresh batteries or the front panel controls
if i try to power it on there is no response
after  minutes if i try again the power will come on
then i try to play the dvd
again no response but if i try again after several minutes it might work
this repeats for nearly every subsequent command
when i finally give up and try to power it off  you guessed it  it does not respond until i try again some time later
i opened the unit to peek inside but nothing looks amiss
i will try to contact pioneer tomorrow but am not hopeful after just reading other reviews herei wrote a glowing review of this back in november when i thought the device wasnt getting enough attention
in early december dpweb who supported the one decent browser for the vii series went out of business and the application no longer works severely crippling the usefulness of this device
many of palms advertised web clippings no longer work for similar reasons
i had complained to palm many times about software they provided that was not working correctly and about the lack of a usable browser with the demise of dpweb
they promised great things to come soon with many enhancements to their mypalm portalthe great thing came in january and it was the i
palm is no longer interested in fixing anything about the viix or its software that doesnt work properlythey expect you to shell out another to replace your yearold  device which was introduced six months before that at   theyve done this by not providing a palm os  upgrade for the viix while writing new apps for the i that run only on os   it kills me to think that an ancient iii with a modem can run apps that my viix now cannot because there is an os  upgrade for the iiii know just one other person who bought one of these and he is quitting his palmnet service this week because he is sick of the way palm is treating vii series users
hes probably going to buy a treoim hanging on for a while because i still find it useful but im really only getting about  worth for my a month service fee
the problem is that there isnt much of an alternative
the smartphones have too small screens for my taste and i use the email and web on the go more than i would use a phone
if palms new browser they just announced for the i doesnt truncate long web pages as has every browser for the viis and the i save dpweb then i may consider breaking down and buying the iif you want to get an old mb pda at an okay price and you cant find a iiixe then i guess this is it
if youre interested in the wireless service then forget itif you want that then you should get the i and hope that the new browser is decent
the montly cost of wireless and you need the  a month unlimited plan to get the most out of it will eventually dwarf the difference in cost between the two and the level of frustration you will come to experience with palms support for the viix will make you wish you had bought something elsethese cable ties are cheesy
they break as you thread them
i had three crack in my hands
these are a far cry from regular indestructible cable ties of yesteryear
this are pure garbage
i would say the are brittle not durable
they sure be vinyl but they are cheap plastic
could not use them for the intented purpose
waste of money and time selecting them
cheaper does not always save you moneyi finally got around to using some of these so i thought id write a quick review of my experience
hopefully it will help someone else decide if these are right or not for their application
i bought these to keep a couple of plastic bins shut in a semisecure fashion
i also bought a small pair of side cutters to keep handy for cutting them loose when needed
it turns out i didnt need the cutters after all
they certainly arent meant for security but i figured in a pinch it was better than nothing and might keep an honest person honest and from poking around
one of them broke when i was threading the end through other end and pulling it tight
two others broke after i had them threaded through and simply hooked a finger through a little of the slack just to tug on it lightly to make sure it wasnt going to pull loose
so i guess it really just depends on what youll be using them for
if its simply bundling some wires together for some cable management then theyll probably work just fine
if theres going to be any stress or weight on them at all then i would pass and find something else that doesnt break quite so easy
granted im probably using them a bit outside what they were designed for but i seem to remember cable ties in the past that i couldnt break with just my hands no matter what i tried
in the past i ended up having to get some cutters or a knife of some sort to cut them open
these are definitely not of that typethese are not gb ties as indicated
ive used gb ties for years and these are not them
i was suspicious of these ties immediately because they came in an unmarked plain plastic bag
i took one out looped it and was able to bust the tie by simply pulling on it with little force
i tried another tie to make sure it wasnt a fluke  same result although it was a different part of the tie that snapped this timeif you are looking for ties to hold any sort of load then skip these
im sending my back they are not as advertisedi bought these to hold wire mesh cubes together
almost every single cable tie broke either right when threaded or as i was pulling it tight
i was not threading it incorrectly nor was i using too much force but they would snap and shatter like nobodys business
i needed  ties so i thought the pack of  was overkill  but when all was said and done i wound up with  that hadnt snapped and filled in the rest with smaller nonuvb resistant ties
these are absolute garbage
do not waste your money or your time on themvery poor quality cable ties not gb brand as advertised
i bought these about months ago for an outdoor antenna project and just now got around to getting it done too late to return themany amount of force at all and they just break total junkits a fun camera if you dont mind expensive mini prints
the sticky film can be fun
its a fun digital camera too except polaroid is too stupid to put even basic software on the webdont lose the cd
if you thought youd take the camera and your laptop on a fun trip because the camera only holds small photos dont lose the cd
you wont be able to view pictures ever again if you lose the cdand without usb
what were they thinking
getting pictures out of this thing is like watching paint dryi was looking for a backpack upgrade after finding my overtheshoulder bag too small to hold a two lenses film a filter wallet and a cleaning kit for my nikon n which is an average sized slr
the tamrac expedition  disappointed me for several reasons too small  the bag is not the size of an average backpack it is about  smaller and closer to a shoebox in profile
there is no room for lens hoods
even the slack from the camera strap causes space problems when trying to zipunzip the bag
tamrac certainly could have made this bag much more functional had it been the size of a standard backpack
 no room for film  upon buying the bag i found out that it requires a film holster accessory in order to hold film sold separately
the other alternative is to leave a lens behind and use that space instead
 inadequate space for filters  a filter wallet will fit in the front pouch with a bit of finagling
but they are somewhat unprotected and if a tripod is mounted on the outside it will be applying pressure on this space and compromising the filters
 slow access due to hard to open zippers  the fabric and zippers are stiff and difficult to unzip and access
spontaneous quickreaction photography is nearly impossible if your camera is packed awaythis bag is a great idea without a market  its far too big for a pointandshoot camera but far too small to carry the standard accessories any slr photographer would normally keep
i strongly recommend looking at other options and do carefully compare dimensionsi knew i was buying a small camera backpack but i had no idea that it was that tiny
the photo makes us think it is bigger but it is really tiny
it fits just a small camera such us canon xti no batery grip one extra small lens such as tamron mm and some memories or bateries  that is all  the thing that really bothered me most is that it is too narrow shallow and tight
it is really impossible to fit all that gear showed in the photo they use for the commercial
do not buy it
it does not worthok this bag is small i knew that before i bought it
but what i didnt know what that the bag has a piece of material about an inch over the zipper that makes it difficult to open the bag quickly
it is irritating i wish i never bought this bag for my camera
i went back to my old camera baga review that i should have written years ago  i know that this product is no longer made
it peformed very poorly and finally gave out just after the warranty had expired
this technology has come a long way since  i would never buy an ipod knock off  unless it had a very good track record of performance and ease of usefirst mp player rca lyra   hated it
cheep quality and sounded funky
returned it
bought the creative nomad ii mg  loved it at first
after one week the left channel started making strange noises
sent it back for repair as they assured a new unit would be sent to me as soon as the bad unit was received
creative had it for twentythree days and returned the same unit with no explanation
still bad
called tech support again
they said they would send me a refurbished unit
i wanted a new unit as the one i had was only one week old when it started having problems
they assured me refurbished was better than new as it had been thoroughly tested
i fell for it and they drop shipped me a refurbished unit
disaster
scratched did not work most of the time locked up and would not work at all with my mb media card
shipped everything back to creative  two months later and i still do not have a working unit
i am not alone in this as i have read other reviews on amazoncom and other places
past thirty days so i cant get any money back
dont waste your money on this one until they have the bugs outi have tried two of these cards from amazon and neither has worked with my dell  running windows  eventually not having endless time to resolve the problems and getting sluggish and frankly useless techsupport from dlink via their website i gave up and am getting a refunddont waste your time on this worthless piece of junki just received this card and was very excited about it
after  hours of calls to dlink dell and microsoft noone can help me install it so that all the dll files are actually foundi give upreturns here we comeinstallations did not go as the instructions dictated
it didnt work with my western digital firewire drive
i have emailed their support and waited on phone hold
they never emailed me back and i got sick of being on holdi print large graphic images about  meg to a epson photo ex
using lpt parallel port these image complete in under  minutes
recently i purchased a linksys efsp printerserver
printing the same image through the efsp printserver takes over an hour
i have isolated the problem to the epson printer driver used
if i use a dumbed down epson driver from windows  disk specifically epson stylus color escp then the speed through the linksys efsp printserver is comparable to parallel port lpt however image quality is very poor
linksys technical support first indicated i had a defective unit
i replaced the unit and had the same results
now im told i should return the unit because it is incompatible with my epson photo ex sure now tell me after i toss all the packing
linksys documentation maintains compatibility with epson but dont believe itas with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
i bought a vector brand inverter at walmart and it is much betterthis item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car
eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets
dont waste your money on this piece of crapive done everything i can think of short of paying the long distance charge to call tech support to get this card to work
ive decided to sell the card to a friend and get another one that will work with winmei purchased this card because the linksys web site said this card pcm worked in both bit and bit slots
it does not
i sent them email about the incorrect page and told them that because of the error i have to pay to ship the card back to amazon
a person from linksys replied with a twoword email quotthank youquot  im not looking for perfection but courtesy would not seem too much to expectthey have now updated the web page to say that a bit slot is required
im giving the card one star based on the fact that it didnt perform as originally advertisedthis is a lowquality unacceptable cable
the connector tip lacks girth and will easily slip out of guitar or amp jacks
they seem to have literally cut corners on this product
you will easily notice its low quality and functionality when you compare it to a good  cable like a whirlwind the leader modeliomega disks have to be the worst form of storage media ever  created
they are easily corruptable
i cant tell you the number of disks ive had to throw away because they have died on me
theyve destroyed projects that ive saved on them
projects that were unretrievable because all of a sudden the disk cannot be read by the computer or even worse freezes the computeron top of all this iomega disks are way too expensive for being such a bad product
i even had to ask an iomega technician what i was doing wrong
after going over possible scenerios of what ive might of done we both concluded it wasnt me but indeed there was something wrong with the disksmy advice is to stay away from iomega disks and all other iomega products and go with cdrw disks of any brand
they store more info are much cheaper and are much more reliablenormally ive been really happy with monster products
theyre usually more expensive than the competitors but better quality too
this speaker selector is an exception
theres not really much to it but the wire connections on the back really suck  especially if youre using ga or ga wire
i cant get the connections to stay in place if i move the unit at all  really frustrating
i dont know why they didnt design it to use with their own crimp terminals like i have on everything else
if you want my advice look for something else
im returning this item my first ever return after many years of amazon shoppingi am having trouble saying anything nice about it
its bulking weights  times most flash mp players
the controls are touchy
it is very easy to restart your clikdisks
the clikdisks are cheap compared to flash but cdrs are cheaper and last longer
the riovolt and samsungs mp cdr players have out done it
if you want light weight and compact look at some of the smaller lighter flash units
if you want a large selection on songs riovolt is bettermy handspring was a trusted resource for the first   months i had it
last week it suddenly stopped working
i went to handsprings site and filled out the return form only to be told it was out of warranty which wasnt true i have  months left on my warranty
i called customer service and was told of my options call tech support with my claim which charges a flat fee of  have it repaired quotout of warrantyquot for  or as handsprings website suggestsquotsometimes the cost of repairing an older device is almost as much as purchasing a new one
we welcome you to explore your options maybe it makes more sense to simply buy a new device of the same type or even treat yourself to the latest amp greatestquotthanks handspring ive explored my optionsand im switching to sonythis is a word of advice to any wouldbe buyers of the jamcam  quotdontquot
the product is a toy at best
but the real problem yes there is one worse is the business practices of this company
nonexistent customer support emails bounce invalid tollfree numbers and unclaimable rebate offers
there is defintiely something fishy going on
i would go as far as to say beware of kbgear in general
i learned at a price
i rate this product a onestar only bc a zero rating is not possiblekb gear has gone out of business
does not work with xp and never willthis koreanmade case for the digital elph is a disappointment
the main compartment can barely hold the digital elph
every time i put my camera in the case i have to use a lot of force fearing i would do some harm to the camera a fear admittedly not well founded
it can be a very frustrating experiencethe case also looks ugly and feels cheap
the front compartment can hold a battery and a cf card but theres no easy way to carry the case except just holding the whole thingbut right now jan  you have no choice if you need a case for the s
shame on canon for not including a case in the digital elph camera kitthe product does not come in a case as displayed in the picture
it actually came in a bag
the sound is extremely poor just like the headphones you might get for free on a plane flighti compared a bunch of low price earbuds using my daughters st gen ipod my sons zune and my recently acquired nd gen touch with consistent results for all earbuds testedthis model has splashy smeared highs that after some amount of listening is fatiguing
dont know what the folks who praise the sound of these are listening to but then also i cant fathom why budwieser is the most popular beerthe sony mdrelp was the best sounding headphone of the bunch i tested by quite a margin
the sony has clearer much less smeared highs and sounds more musical giving a sense of airsound stage
slight emphasis on the low end but its not too bad
get those dont waste your ears on thesei bought these bacause of the good reviews i was amazed upon getting an ipod that the phones included with it have so little volume and so little bass
i am especially annoyed with that the whole no bass thing i love rock and roll and i love it loud and punchy as i ride that mountain bike
anyways i got these and found that they fit well in my ear looked forward to comparing with the other phones i purchased at the same time to test them out against the inexpensive philips phones the best id found thus fara horrific comparison
these phones are trash
no volume to speak of
junky midrange junky treble muddy soft bass no bass really its like listening to music under water maybe if you have a radio on when you take a bath and then dunk your head under the water  thats how these headphones soundim sending them back for refund but even if they didnt refund the dough id not keep them id gladly cut them up with a smile on my lips a song in my heartbuy the philips hs behindthehead headphones instead
they absolutely rock great throughout the entire range loud as can be though id have them louder if i could  loud is best on that mountain bike clear thumping bass great highs great midrange all clear
and nine bucks to boot
i have tried at least twenty pair of phones the philips hs stand alone the bestdecent enough headphones sound is fine
but the cord isnt long enough tor each from my ears to my pockets
so theyre useless to methere was loose connection in the contacts because of which the extension cord did not work
the extension cord is spiral and pulls the the end which make is difficult to use it if you are using it for headphonesthe moment i opened the box and plugged in the extension audio cord it immediately failed me
i have gotten cheap audio cords and they at least last a month but these didnt even last a dayi feel the above topic says it all sorry for how late this is but i find my self very busy with booming home businessi bought these cables so i can connect my headphones to tv directly so i can play games and watch movies without bothering other people at my home
once connected after few minutes the vocals started to go off and music started to dampen i thought i may had a bad cables or something i contacted the seller and they advised to connect it to av receiver or an amp otherwise through these cables the sound wont reach the other end
what kind of extension is this were you need to have an amp otherwise you wont get a sound
if i have an av receiver i wouldnt be listening through headphones to begin with these extension cables are suppose to work with basic setup like laptops tv etc so if you want good quality extension with basic setup dont buy these as you would waste your money and when i asked for seller to return these they would refund me once they receive the product and they wont cover shipping so dont waste your money as if you ship them back you will only get couple of bucks back so not even worth sending backmaybe it was the set i received but i got nothing but static  crackle from my headphones plugged into a receiver with these
as others have said the adapters work great but the extension cord itself is the factor
your mileage may varyi purchased this with a new pc to make moving some files and settings over easy
it did connect after some tinkering with xps networking but most of the files were corrupted in the transfer so i ended up having to move the files to a drive on my old pc and then install the drive on the new one
dont know if this is trustworthy enough for other uses if you want to network two pcs it didnt do the job for me
note i was using xp  on both machines and ntsc file systemhad high expectations for this cable but perhaps a dsl phone cable just exists for 
this cable has been the source of consistent and random disconnections from my dsl through out the day forcing me to manually relog into the system to get my connection back after modem resetting
weeks later i switch back to a cheap standard phone cable and everything is back to normal
will try a different brand and hope for the best but im wondering if it will really do me any good
i like to think so but speedtests sure dont confirm iti find it unacceptable that such a cable cant at least match the performance of a standard cable that costs next to nothing
i did expect it to have some increased bandwidth abilities due to cable quality but i suppose this stuff falls in line with the overall cable debates such as speaker wire etc
like why buy monster cable for so much money when something else is a fraction of its cost but just as good
or why use  gauge when  works just as good under  feetchances are if these cables are giving you increased speeds you probably just had a bad former cable and any new standard phone cable would work just as goodspeaking of bad cables i probably did get a bad belkin dsl cable but whatev im going to try cables to go next
ill see for myself with my next purchase that i will make because i must admit i can swear i got a decent speed boost around as much as i expected to get with improved cables
however this may have been time related during off peak hours
i will toy around with this and report back my final observations testing standard and enhanced dsl cables during off peak hours with speed tests
if theres a real difference it wont be hard to seethis is item do not work at all and i am contemplating about returning it but with the shipping cost i am wondering if it would be worth it
now if his product is just faulty then i would like a replacement of said itemseems to be a generic cable belkin is not imprinted on it
you have to wiggle the ends to get sound out of both ends
not worth doing an exchange or refund
going into my trash cannot sure if it is genuine or not but this cable does not work properly
the sound cuts out of the left channel and you have to wiggle the cable to make it work
this is not a good producti really wish i went with the  more expensive gold plated cord
this one is terrible
from my computer to my sound system it literally broke within  hourits making the loud hissing noise and its truly worth nothing nowdont buy this cablei use this for my ipod in my car
after  months of near daily use it is cutting out the right channel very consistently i have to jiggle it to get it working correctly
total pain when youre driving
although it started cutting out about two months ago ive just been putting up with it since then
i will be ordering a more expensive one mediabridge  mm male to mm male stereo audio cable   feet new design accomodates iphone itouch smartphone and mp cases in hopes it will last longeri received the first one last week
tested and found there was no continuity
thats means of course it does not ground anything
returned to for a replacement
amazon replaced it immediately
the replacement also has tested with no continuity
after further testing i have found that the end connections on the end of the wire are bad
no continuity from connection to wire
will return the second one for a full refund
manufacturer may need better quality control
amazon may have just received a bad batch of thesethe clamp broke and easily came undone from the strap
the strap itself had the tendency to come unclipped from the wristband
youre better off going with another wrist band though based on my experiences id probably rather just tie myself to the computer with a length of copper wire than buy another of thesei looked at some reviews and they said it didnt workafter i bought onei tested it it dont work plain and simpleeasy to testlike u test for a broken wireif u got one i suggest you test it before you use it or you could have a very costly problemon my first use the connector from the wire to the wrist band broke
its not worth the cost or shiping
i have not been a fan of belkin and i will never buy another product of theirs again period
over priced equiptment with horid qualityi have to wonder if my unit was defective or belkin is actually making the units nonconductive as placebos
belkin could get sued i suppose if someone got electrocuted by making themselves the path of least resistance wearing one of these things
so maybe these are intentionally nonfunctional as a result just to make people think they are protecting their precious computeror maybe i just have a defective unit
the molded connections sadly fall unrepairableanyway it seemed like a decent product the wrist strap is pretty narrow be aware though it will fit on most wrists it wont fit further up your arm or on your ankle or something you might preferif you really want to be grounded test conductivity with a ohmmeteri got the product and tried to hook it up to my pc case to ground my self as i was reaching over the clip broke from the yellow strap
i guess you get what you paid for good thing is its cheap bad thing is what a waste of moneyi not gonna accept what these people want to give meim paying so send what i order or just return my moneyill go to best buy or walmart some place that will get things right the first timeplease people avoid this company at all costi have a number of rj ethernet patch cables around my house
these connectors do not fit any of them
they are not the same connector type as the familiar ethernet jack on the back of your pceven though the package is marked ethernet i think they are only for  line telephone cables
no use at all for ethernet cablesat least any of the ones i ownthey dont cost enough to ship backthe back of the package specifies that these are not cat connectors whatever that meansi was using a dlink dir router with a  cat  cable
my connection speed is around mbs download mbs upload roadrunner lightning servicei wanted to move my router a few feet so i ordered this  cable
its amazingly inexpensive and linksys and cisco are great namesproblem
this cable cuts my speed in half for downloads mbs and totally ruins upload speed mpsless than  the speed with the other cableits not because its  longer because i have a  cat  delivering full speed to other parts of the housethis new cable is thinner than the  i tried to replace
maybe that one is shielded and thats whats causing the problem
maybe i just got a bad cable
if anyone has advice id like to hear it
its not worth returning for a  refund but this cable is unusable for mei guess if you have a ghetto computer this would work
but if you have a nice system good video card nice lcd then this will ruin your video
if you need an extension try another cable
or better yet move the monitor closer to the computeri have a nice  lcd and a good video card but this thing makes picture blurry and distorted
if you have an old junky system that has bad video anyway then this would work fine for youi bought these and the competing m electronic equipment cleaning wipes at the same time for my it shopthese wipes dried out shortly after opening the canister
not just the next wipe in line but even the wipes inside the canisterthe competing m product mentioned earlier is great though
both of the canisters were opened at the same time and stored in the same cabinet
one of the products is completely useless the other is going strongthe product is probably fine its the packaging that makes it worthlessi bought this because just about all the reviews said it was good
unfortunately it makes streaks across my laptop screen
i have to take windex and a paper towel to clean it up
the same thing happened to my brothers screen
not worth it at allits like wiping your monitor off with wd
somebodygoofed on these
not sure what i can use these things fornow
yes i know im from alabama and a degree fromthe u of a but i need more instructions or a differentbrandi plug in in my router was my surprise doesnt work with regular routers  maybe need more information how to usethis item looks great in appearance but is completely nonfunctional
 the fit at both ends of the cable when installed into my devices is far far too tight  both installing and removing
 even with firmly installing each end being careful to create what should be a good connection this cable did not transmit the internet signal
at all
ever
dead on arrivali reattaching my old cheap short cable and voila
the signal is just fine
i need a  foot cable but it has to work or whats the point
ive purchased other belkin products in the past which have worked fine but this one was a total waste of money and timethis is a nicely made cable however there are a few things that are not very well engineeredfirst off are the connectors and their ease of removal  i had to remove this cable after i found that it was defective and not working and i could almost not get these connectors unplugged from my modem or the wall jack
this should be an easy and simple thing to do however the release tab on each connector end flexes way too much when being depressed thus not allowing the latch to disengage the connector without a major effort
i had a heck of a time trying to get this cable unplugged once it was plugged in almost damaging my modem and wall jacksecond major problem was that this cable was doa  absolutely no dsl signal when i replaced my old cable with this new one
i tried several times to get it to work but i got nothing
when i connected my old att cable back up all was well and working as usual
i had to return this belkin modem cable for a refundthirdly be aware that this cable comes very tightly wound up into a small bundle  resulting in a much coiled modem cable when you unroll it
it will take some time to try and straighten it out enough to get the full usable  feetthis modem cable did not work out for me even though it was well made
sorry but i cannot recommendi have to pay to return
not their fault but the brother printer i ordered along with this didnt work
brother products are worthless
cannot use the cable
hate i have to paynot what i ordered amazon did not have a good picture and it said usb not two different ends
amazon needs to label items so customers can ordered what the want
i gave it only one star because i did not want this kind of cable
amazon did let me keep these still in their packi purchased this cable with a brother hld laser printer on the same order there was a link to it on the amazon page for the printer
this cable will not work with the brother hld
it does work with a hp f ink jet
i was lucky to have some extra cables to swap around to determine the problem i am an it pro
buyer bewarei bought this cable a year ago and it worked fine to begin with
as of today it wont work
this cord was rarely used maybe  times total
i only used it to transfer info from my pocket drive to my laptop when im out of towni saw some other reviews that sounded like they received some cheap rd party cables
i believe mine is a real belkin product as it has their name product number style number and other info written on the cable itselfi have confirmed that my pocket drive works with another generic cord i have here at the house
i will not be rebuying this belkin cord this time aroundthe belkin usb cord i received didnt work but amazons great customer service took care of my refund promptlythis cable is total and absolute crap
doesnt even have the surge protector on it that makes usb cables hot swappable
furthermore it doesnt work if it cost more than  i would send it back on principal as it is i tossed the junk in the trash
word to the wise avoid like the plaguei purchased this product since it was a recommendation along with a case when i purchased my fujitsu scanner
this cable doesnt even fit the scanner
im sure its a good cable and should be rated higher than  star  so take that into consideration
do not buy this product as part of a bundle from amazon because its totally useless and isnt needed for the fujitsu scanner
i expect better  and normally receive better  from amazonnot a belkin cable  total rd party piece of junk
flimsy and extremely low quality
the bag is also obviously a generic brand with a little white sticker that says belkin on
pfffliars
dont buyi too spent too much time trying to get my printer to work when all along it was this cable
as soon as i realized it was the cable i started the process to return it since amazon will pay for return shipping on damaged items
ill try a better cableps  it was in an official belkin package im guessing its just hit or misspostal delivery never got to me
post office insists they delivered but i never got the package
reported to amazon and got credit for purchase without any hassle
cables never showed upi got this cable because it was a bit more appropriately priced and because of expected belkin quality
i fail to understand why these cables are so expensive in us it just doesnt make sense
i have been buying networkethernet cables all my life at onetenth the cost in other countries and hardly ever had issues with them
there is hardly any difference in quality of these products to make them worth anything beyond us for a ft cable
anyways seeing the somewhat better price on this product and  perfect ratings i ordered this from amazon
the cable arrived promptly a few days ago and i only got to test the cable out yesterday
to my disappointment the cable didnt work
i am also doubtful if it is a genuine belkin product because of the cheap feel of the package it came in
anyways i never expected this even of a fake knockoff product since its very easy to test these cables before packaging or sending them out
have requested a refund and will probably not order these cables from amazon againnotice how amazon recommends purchasing together the belkin cable and fujitsu snapscan
well i thought i would give myself more flexibility in positioning my scanner by using this longer cable
and since it was recommended by amazon that others purchase these  products together and amazon cuts you a deal to boot why not get both
big mistake
i spent hours reading every technical support item that came with my fujitsu snapscan to learn why my brand new scanner isnt recognized by any of my computers after loading the drivers
luckily it was too late to call technical support they are only available from am to pm mf
so i took my new scanner home and slept on it
when i woke up this morning i thought let me try one more time  this time i only used the products that came with the fujitsu snapscan  and it worked like a breeze
lessons learned  belkin and other manufacturers products may not be compatible 
so if you are using this product with fujitsus snapscan  definitely passand message to amazon  please do a little home work when you advertise bundled products
i expected that your smarty pants technology guys would only suggest purchasing products which work with one anotheri just purchased this item a few days ago and it just arrived
first thing i noticed was that it looked just like a cheap usb cable put in plastic which is unusual for a belkin product
i checked the cable and nowhere on it does it actually say belkin
so be warned this item is a cheap generic cable being sold as a belkinim sure the cable will just work fine but its the combination of brand recognition and price that helped sell the product to me
plus false advertising is not coolnot sure why but i suspect the length was the problem
this cable wouldnt work for my imac and hp printeri should have read the other reviews
the cable marginmart shipped was not a belkin
tried it on my printer and printing stopped halfway through
you can tell its a fake because belkin cables have a distinct color and shape  see the photo in this listingbelkin cables are thick and grey with fat figureeight connectors
this cable is a cheap looking thin black cable with small molded connectors
belkin cables have the word belkin molded on them and a part number on the cable
this has no words anywhere
belkin cables come in belkin packaging this came in a plastic bag with a fake belkin sticker on itstay away from marginmart
go buy somewhere elsedidnt work
threw it in the garbage and boughtcables to go  usb  a male to b male cable white  feet  meters purchased on by cables to goit worked finethis item was sold as a belkin gold cable
i actually received a cheap monoprice cable
the package was labeled belkin but the item is not stamped with the belkin name and clearly says monoprice
i wish i had read the other one star reviews before purchase
this is a blatant case of false advertisingthey sent me mono price usb cable this is absolute con
these cables are cheaply made by mono price
please make sure not to buy this product from margin martthe product shipped from marginmart was a monoprice brand cable not a belkin
looks like an acceptable cable but not the belkin i ordered
id avoid monopricetitle says it all the cable i received was a monoprice cable that says monoprice all over it definitely not a belkin gold cable
came without packaging just in a plastic bag with a sticker with small black font that says belkin gold on itcable has quite bad ghostingmultiple shadows on high contrast areas
this comes from badly shielded signal cables
definitely do not recommenddoes anything use svga anymore
well let me just say that it does me no good at all
the listing claims vgathis cable damaged my fostex d digital recorder and forced my dell monitor into test mode
i hooked the cable up and smoke came out of the fostex
it will now require extensive repair
if you look at the specs for a vga cables  you will find thatpin  redrtn red returnpin  greenrtn green returnpin  bluertn blue returnpin  keypwr formerly key now v dcpin  gnd ground vsync ddci did some resistance tests and on the cable the distributor sent me and all these pins showed a connection
this is probably what is causing ghosting due to crosstalk
plus they are connected to some of the top row pins as well
i tried the cable out on a video monitor and it forced the monitor into test modefurther testing showed that there was no continuity on these pins where the specs sayspin  idres formerly monitor id bit  reserved since eddcpin  vsync vertical synci noted that other pins were not connected as well but ceased testing
avoid this cable at all costs
it will damage your equipmenti am shipping this piece of garbage back today
my modem started acting weird flashing lights and whatnot after plugging this in and to top it off i couldnt get the connector out of the modem worked fine with the phone end until i used a needlenose pliers and then it appeared my new modem was broken
fortunately after a nearnervous breakdown and less shaky hands the old line fit back in and internet was up and running
what a disaster
the remaining stock should be burned in a pyre by the fccif you have this cable cut off the ends and put your own on
was getting random disconnects all the time
wiggled the cable end in the socket at it would disconnect
changed the wall plate and this cable wouldnt even go in all the way
ordered another brand of cable and have not had a problem sincei remembered after getting this cable why i returned  years ago
i update my cables every few years once i switched to this my network basically came to a haltproduct featurespiece tool set ideal for repairs and chip installationextractioncomes with philips screwdriver no

it would not produce a picture
it was totally useless
i have mailed it back to the seller expecting to get a refund i hope
fortytwo dollars is a lot of money to spend on film that produces not one picture
so far the seller has been nice and cooperative
well see if that remains truethe one i got in  looks just like the picture so i think its still the same blue one
it does not say belkin anywhere on the tool
i bought it because i trusted the name brand
i believe it is not belkin madethat would be ok if it worked but it does not align right with the connectors
i have other brand crimpers and they work like a charm
i thought how hard can it be for one to work
wellthis one doesnt
i used it some and now its older but im sick of finishing out the crimps by hand with a screwdriver and tossing ittime to buy a decent brand name crimper
this is junk
your milage may vary
perhaps some of these have better alighnement
for me it just adds to the cost of buying a working one to have bought this one firstjust sayini had such high hopes for this ironon labeler tape so i am very dissapointed
i have two kids in preschool so i need to label everything and i havent found a way to use permanent markers to write neatly and without bleeding through the garment and im not really good with a needle and thread so this ironon labeler tape seemed like the perfect solution
each label went on fine with no lifted edges or anything that indicated thered be trouble
but after the very first wash all of the labels fell off
i tried them on a variety of clothing  denim khakis cotton tshirts cotton thermal shirts and i waited to wash the items until a day after application to allow it to set up but each and every label came off on the very firstg wash i just wasted instructions for installing this card were a nightmare to follow
i bought this card to help my mom out and even i could not understand the instructions which were poorly translated from chinese
the proper driver was not included on the disk and it was extremely difficult to find a windows  driver
netgear does not seem to fully support this hardware with windows drivers
i would have sent it back but the price was so cheap it just was not worth the hassle
i did learn to never buy a cheap nic card like this in the futureif you like to gamble on mediocre hardware then by all means by this card maybe youll get lucky and it wont lockup your machine or freeze your system for several minutes randomly
do yourself a favor and search google for netgear fa and look at all the problems
this card has a major hardware flaw that cant be solved by drivers or firmware updates
ive tried using  different drivers two from netgear and one from the chip manufacturer themselves all  resulted in random freezes within  minutes of booting into windows
if netgear is aware of the problem theyre yet another company that doesnt support their customers because they dont admit it and they dont offer a fix
probably because its a hardware issue that cant be fixed with software
i hear these problems are solved on the fa because it uses a totally different chipset so if you absolutely have to buy a card from netgear get that instead of the fai thought belkin was a good name so i payed  for a cable that i could have gotten for 
after a year of heavy use it developed a short so i purchased a cable for a quarter of the price and its working fine and i bet it will last as long as the belkin cable did
i have had trouble with several belkin cables my belkin firewire shorted my belkin ethernet shorted and my belkin videobus shorted
its not the plugs it is an intermitant short somewhere in the wire maby it is interferance caused cheap wirethe angled picture of the ends of this cable make it hard to tell but the connectors do not have the trapezoidal shape required for any of the digital cameras i own jvc everiocanon powershot olympus
the cable appears to be well made but is useless unless youre connecting to sonysingularly the worse and most unreliable computer product ive ever experienced
all i can say is that i followed installation directions for the sandisk compactflash reader and what happened next was a computer nightmare  my computer went into an uncontrollable cycle of loading windows  then restarting
what i had to do was reload windows and all my programs  an eight hour ordealdont buy this
i used this on a mac
it worked ok when i just had a couple of devices on it but when i added a wifi usb adapter it caused frequent computer crashes on startup loss of internet connection and freezing of my mouse
i thought it was the adapters fault but after reading the reviews here i bought a dlink usb hub to replace it
havent had a problem sincenot much of a review here
i will just stick to the basics
it sucks doesnt work
dont buy this even if the price seems rightbuying this hub could be the worst thing you ever do to your computer
i run windows xp and it warned me that this hub is not windows xp certified
fine by me since most hardware isnt but works just fineeverything was going fine until i tried plugging in usb peripherals
none of them worked including my logitech quickcam epson c printer and handspring visor cradlelater that night it was driver conflict hell
before long i lost my entire windows xp install due to repeated appearances of the blue screen of death yep it does exist in windows xp after allneedless to say i will never buy another belkin product again if i can help itworked great for a few weeks until i started getting warning windows telling me there wasnt enough power to supply the usb devices it was connected to
of course then i started reading other reviews saying the same thing
next time im buying a usb hub with its own power supply
even though this wasnt expensive it wasnt worth the moneyas many others have said theres no reason to by a powered usb hub when it cant even support one usb device which is not selfpowered
i also get the not enough power message pop up on my computer when trying to connect one usb devicesince my imac only has  usb ports
 is used by the keyboard
 for the printer and the last for a router
but that still leaves my scanner dsl modem and voip telephone
so i bought this hub
from day one my computer would report low usb power
i would then have to unplug  or  things to get something else to work
although it pluggs into a power outlet apparently the individual ports are not powered self powered
i replaced it with a dlink which is working great with things plugged into all  ports
i recommend that you pass on this product and go with a dlinkive had this hub for a while and it worked fine even though the ac adapter was a little bit clunky
but recently i tried attaching an b receiver via the usb and the thing wouldnt work after  days of use  windows reported it being an unknown device
plugging into the back of my computer would still report the same problem  i figured the wireless adapter was faulty
but thenthe other day i plugged a trusty sidewinder into the hub to play some old games
tonight the same thing happened  windows now refuses to recognize the gamepad ive used faithfully for years now
i am convinced this hub is the culprit
spend a little more money to buy a hub whose quality you can really depend onperhaps this was purely my own experience with a faulty hub but id strongly recommend you consider another product  you may be putting your expensive electronics at unnecessary riskthis is a usb hub that works only for devices that do not require power from the usb outlets
if they draw power from usb this will not workthis model was recalled due to a severe flaw including injuriesthe firm has received  reports of the surge protectors overheating and melting and  claims of property damage from smoke and fire including  in fire damage to a home and  in fire damage to a medical facility
there are  reports of injuries including smoke inhalation and contact burns from touching the overheated surge protectors
see this is an indication of low quality design testing and surveillance on the part of apcsince an apc product failed to protect my equipment several years ago and apc refused to honor their guarantee to compensate me for replacement equipment i have since found that zerosurge works well and is reliable in protecting my equipment unlike apcmy motherboard was destroyed by a power surge as was my power supply and memory boards
apcs device should have had a few metal oxide arrestors blow out but none did and the surge proceeded to destroy my equipment
apc techs claimed that since they found nothing wrong with the apc sugearrest they would not honor the guarantee
guess what
the fact that there was nothing wrong with their unit is evidence that it failed
there should have been some blown mo arrestors but they failed to blow
the apc product failed and they refused to compensate me
i dont like it when im lied to regarding warranteesi have discarded all apc units and their worthless guaranteesits not enjoyable to write scathing indictments of a company and i almost never do
but ive been lied to
they warrant that if their product fails to protect your equipment they will compensate you for replacements or repairs
they refused to do sothey liedlast year the consumer product safety commission recalled  million apc surge protectors as they pose a fire hazard
this included  models in the  and  model series including this prot
they have received  reports of overheating and melting  reports of smoke and fire and  reports of injuries due to burns and smoke inhalation
they should have received  reports
ive owned both a series  and a series  surge protector from apc
my series  protector caught fire a few years back
fortunately i woke up in time pc in my bedroom to toss it out into the yard as it burned
shame on me for not filing a report
my little used series  model was recently replaced under the recall by apc with the same model number
it took them  weeks to get me the replacement
i decided not to use the replacement and considered putting it on ebay but ultimately cut the cord off and dropped it off at an electronics recycling center
i have no confidence in a company that takes  years products in the recall mfg
as early as  to finally do the right thingi bought  of these and both of them broke in the first few months
i think they are very cheapid recommend selecting a different security cable product especially if you have a powerbook or macbook
this one is poorly made even more poorly documented and may have permanently damaged my powerbook g
yes the product web site claims this model is compatible with the pb  g
its unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked
hey would it be so bad to actually use words to explain things
even in  or  languages if you like
the diagrams make no sense
in the process of trying to get this to work it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my powerbook
it may have permanently damaged the slot
needless to say i will attempt to return the product for a refundthere are plenty of similar products on the market including others avaiable through amazon
id suggest trying one of thosei purchased this item so i wouldt have to keep crawling on the floor to get to my usb ports on the back of my pci have a printer scanner digital camera all requiring usb portsmy pc recognised the hub when i plugged it in but when i tried to use my scanner it locked up then my camera wouldt connect any more
after several reboots i was able to get one device working at a time however its pointless having a usb hub unless you can connect more than one thing to itneedless to say i have repackaged it and sent it back
i guess i just have to keep crawling around on the floorim not exactly sure how the manufacture expects you to use this product on an airplane as the stabilizing bar behind your head prevents you from leaning back into your seati bought this and the aiwa noise cancelling headphones at the same time
the koss headphones are going up on ebaythis is advertised as a patch cable with terminated ends
it should be stranded conductors and the belkin web site describes the cable as having stranded conductors
however the cable i received has solid conductors making it overpriced and unsuitable for use as a patch cable
looks like the supplier found a way to cut corners on belkin recently  and yes i did not receive the wrong item the packaging indicates the correct model numberamazon is always greathowever these are cheap plastic tools made in china
something you would purchase from harbor freight
amazons return policy is always outstanding
sorry belkinthis is a cheap pile of scrap that look as if they were handmade in china not worth more than  dollarsthese batteries were purchased for a apc charger
rather than purchase generics i purchased what appeared to be oem brand replacement batteries
the batteries arrived and even after being left in the charger for  days with no load they would not take a charge with no load on the ups and allow the ups to power up without failing the initial test
i finally removed the batteries and used an automatic automotive charger that has the ability to charge deaddepleted batteries
after an initial charge on that showed  dead apc batteries but it was able to bring up their voltage
i have installed them in the ups at this point and it will power up past the selftest
i have not at this point attached equipment to them to see if they will run offlinewe ordered  of these apc batteries
we received  apc and another one from a company called abc that looks like a cheap knockoffi couldnt believe amazon was shipping a knockoff after we purchased the original
so i requested a replacement
they apologized and sent one outwe received it and guess what its another abc battery
i complained again and this time the guy admits if he orders another replacement itll probably happen again so hes just going to give us a refundwtf why doesnt someone at amazon ask themselves why they are shipping knockoff products as real products
if i was apc i would be pissedon this newer production run you may expect the majority of the output to be at k with practically no bass or upper treble
this can be fixed with a headphone amplifier however this description doesnt match the classic proaa
what you have here is a newly redecorated proaaa and thats not the same thing
therefore what you receive probably wont match what you expectthe classic proaa is gone
only its appearance remainsthis new item can work for voice communications speech therapy language learning and many other applications where a voiceonly response is appropriate
theyre also useful as a movie propi had mistakenly purchased these for music not realizing that they had been changedi purchased an arbitrary koss headset from a nonname electronics store in south africa which blew my mind with its quality for  full years before breaking whilst changing continents
porta pros are fantastic and have been my staple ever since
i decided to splurge on this unit hoping to get something more like the arbitrary full size headset i mentioned initially
koss normally sounds great to me i am not an audiophile but some headsets are better than others and koss is the best i have heard
this set did not deliver on this basic actuality and i drastically prefer the sound from even porta pros over thisi dont know if my set is broken or not or whether the  mm jack i am driving it from simply lacks the oomph required to make these sound decenti consider myself to be relatively robust and these headphones seriously put a kink in my neck which i could tollerate if the sound quality warranted itgot these today
plugged them in and the sound came on then off plus all scratchysound
just awful
either a poor connector plug or loose wires going to the phonesthe build quality of these is positively awful compared to the koss proaa of thes
if you want to hear what kossproaa really sounds like do yourself a favorand buy a vintage pair on ebay
thats what i am now going to dothe good news amazon return policy rocks 
not so good news was really hoping this item would solve a problem  sharing a fax with a phone line for home office
we have been paying for two separate phone lines for years for our home office and were looking for a way to eliminate the cost of a nd phone line
did a google search and didnt find many options
saw this item on amazon and saw where a majority of buyers were happy with this product as it seemed to be a way to automatically determine which calls were fax and which were voicecalls
ordered via prime membership  got item shipped in about  days
read the product literature and made connections as per the instructions
plugged in the ac power adapter that came with the unit
green light powered up but couldnt get the phone or fax to work
kept getting the offthehook sound in the phone
disconnected  reconnected all lines etc
notice the power light was no longer on and noticed the smell of hot electronics
unplugged and let item sit for several minutes replugged ac adapter and nothingno power light zipzilch nada
ac aapter felt hot to touch
i had this on power strip with other components so it wasnt the power strips faultthe good news is that i logged on to my amazon prime account made a return request explained the issue and within  minutes  i recd an email from the sender that they were giving me a full refund
so that was great news and a relief
i just wish i could find a way to have a fax  phone share a line automatically as wed like to cut the other phone cost out of our small biz budget
i know we could manually do this but its the times when were out of the office and we just dont have a way to set up a phone  voicemail  fax
our cable provider is our phone provider and they dont offer separate  number  line sharing or distinctive ring service either
bummermost new dedicated fax machines will direct a call to itself or to the phoneanswering machine
every answering machine will let you plug the phone into it to take a call
a waste of money for anyone who doesnt have an ancient fax machine they dont want to upgradethis might perhaps be a good product but it will only work with a headset that has a quickrelease plug
i have not found such a headset  even the headset i have from plantronics has the normal mm plug and that one is loud enough so that it doesnt need any amplification
ive tried adding on an adapter but adding extra adapters and connectors can ruin the sound quality or make sound output too weak for anyone to hearthis amplifier plugs into the phones handset jack instead of into a mmmm headset jack  this means you have to pick up the receiver and set it down somewhere whenever you want to make or answer a call instead of just pressing a button to use the phones headset featurepower outages are infrequent in my area so i consider my use to be light duty
the batteries pretty much spend their life in the floating charge mode
the apc batteries that came with the apc backups pro  have a claimed lifetime of  years
in my case the original batteries lasted  years
after  years use the spent battery cases were like newthese helios batteries only lasted  years
when they gave out and i opened the ups to replace them i discovered they had swollen so much that they could not be removed except with a great deal of force year and  months after installing these batteries my apc smartups  ups is telling me to replace the batteries
ridiculousdoes this work
i dont know
let me clarify my one star review
i work in an it dept and when our apc unit started beeping for a new battery i ordered this one
why this one
because it is supposed to be an original apc replacement
when you work for someone who demands everything is perfect you cant risk making a dumb decision to save whats a dumb decision
buying a knockoff battery that melts  days after its plugged in or worse one that starts a fire
lets say that the apc manufactured batter melts
my boss would look at it and say damn apc is sure making some bad stuff
now lets say the battery with the excessups label melts
my boss would look at it and say who the hell ordered this cheap generic battery that nearly caused a fire
do you want to save 
if so go ahead and try this out otherwise go to newegg and get the real mccoyas a computer professional i have purchased hundreds of monitors over the past  years
i have never purchased a worse one that this
i see that many of the problems i experienced have been documented by others here
ill recap  blurry text
it was almost unreadable at the edges of the screen
i had the choice of the screen looking like this   or  
no amount of playing with the controls would change it
the top left corner was quotscrunchedquot and again nothing could fix it
the whole screen was rotated about  degrees
and as with everything else it could not be fixedrun dont walk away from this monitor
the one and only redeeming feature is the pricethis is not a review
the samsung people have provided a contact email for problems
i think thats great but they gave themselves  stars
this  star review is to average that outi have owned my unit for   years for use primarily as a home office  monitor and bedroom tv
i have it connected to my laptop docking station and satelight dish for tv
overall i have enjoyed its use with the convenience of a monitor and pip tv
the picture is bright and clear and the resolution is of sufficient quality for close viewing in a small room
my only caution is a recurring problem i have now encountered  separate times
if the monitor is on when a power outage occurs and the power suddenly comes back on the monitor will be damaged and the brightness will be reduced by 
i know all about the dangers of power surges so i connected the monitor to a quality surge protector
still on three separate occasions the unit has failed in the same situation
the first two happened during the  year warranty period and samsung sent me a refurbished replacement free of charge
tonight it happened again and i am out of warranty so im sol
if you plan to use this unit for more than  years you might want to consider an extended warranty or a different productive had this camera for years and dont use it becausei cant see what im shooting
the lcd screen is washedout from the light of day
never buy a camera thatdoes not have a view finder along with the lcdscreen
when i first bought the camera i thought it hada view finder and ended up keeping it too long beforei could really determine that i needed one
by that timei couldnt return the camera
i think sony deliberatelyomits this information on all cameras in order to sellthose with lcd screens that dont have view finderswouldnt you know it sony upgraded thismodel with a  pixel with a view finder
this seemsto be a problem with sony
there are just too manydifferent models that sony should retire pull andtake the loss instead of confusing loyal customersand selling out dated and techno defective productsto a public that still tends to trust the sony brandi think my next digital camera will be a cannonthe glossy covers have started gatting small white spots all over the pages and i have only used it for no more than  month
bad quality dont buyjust to let you know  i am not a professional and am just beginning to take my first baby steps with filters
i read about polarizing filters and i became interested in trying one out
not being sure about the results id get and most definitely not being able to afford an expensive one i picked the tiffen mm to experiment with
i purchased this filter for use with my canon vixia hf g video camera in the hopes that i could get some satisfactory sky  beach shots
in this humid hazy summer time weather my outdoor shots are just mehthis is my first polarizing filter and my first day with it and so far i am having nothing but problems with itfirst i suspect that i have received a used filter because the package was not sealed and the filter was dirty on both sides
shipped and sold by amazoncomi cleaned it off and attached it to my uv filter that was already in place on my camera
this brings us to the second issue
it kept falling off
luckily i was seated at the time and it fell into my lap rather than onto the concrete sidewalk
so then i got the bright idea not
of attaching it directly to my camera
this solved the problem of it staying in place boy did it ever
and i thought that i could actually begin testing it out however i could not adjust the outer ring with the camera hood in place
in broad daylight i must have the hood on my camera otherwise i get lens flares
trying to adjust it and then putting the hood on causes the filter ring to movelastly i absolutely can not get it off of my camera
yes i am aware of which part of the filter that needs to be grasped and turned
yes i tried the rubber band and bottle opener grip and latex glove methods all without success
i have to go purchase the filter wrenches now and hope that works otherwise ill have to take my camera to a pro and see if they can get it off i wonder how much they charge for that
i wanted to do some with and without shots for comparison but was not able to do sothis filter seems to be more trouble than its worth
i dont see myself ever attaching it directly to my camera again that is if i ever get it off
edit i had to wait a few days for my order of filter wrenches to arrive i couldnt find any shops locally that had them
once they arrived and after a few attempts i was finally able to remove the filter from my camerabought this filter in the mm size
upon opening the package noticed that there was a significant rattle when using the filter
upon further inspection i found that the actual glass in the metal filter housing was loose
that is while the glass would not completely fall out of the metal rings which rotate around each other so you can rotate the filter while keeping it mounted it could still shift significantly around within the housing
not a good feelingended up returning it due to worries about it breaking or possibly damaging other equipmentthis is the first tiffen filter i have purchased in decades and it is a huge disappointment
i remember the older ones having more threads on each side
this filter mm circular polarizer is so minimalist it barely has enough threads to fasten to my camera
trying to rotate the filter is a trick
there is nothing to hold onto and if i am not careful the polarizer can come off the camerai order three different polarizer filters two of them arrived in good condition and with nothing wrong but my mm pol
filter came with problems
it seems like it was used before
it was dusty in between the ringwhere it movesand to ruin everything it did not fit correctly on my mm lens
i rechecked to see if i order the wrong size filter but i didnt i screwput the filter several times into my lens but it kept popping out of it for some reason
bought another filter from somewhere else and it fit perfectly that filter was clean wasnt dusty and it fit perfectly into my lensa circular polarizer has three mechanical components
one is the set of threads for mounting to the camera
the second is the mechanism that mounts the rotating polarizing glass to the camera base mount to the camera
the third is the set of threads that allows an additional filter or a lens cap
only the last is functional
the first two are loose
the problem with loose mounting between the filter and the camera can intermittently one time it works the next time it doesnt cause the filter to require a plumbers wrench hyperbole to remove the filter other times it comes off as one would expect
with the rotating glass it is too loose
set it and bump the outer ring and the setting is off
dont think that it cant happen between shots
other manufacturers circular filters have more resistance
both the filter section and the lensmount section jiggle in their settings
i only use the outer filter threads for the lens cap
i havent had any problems losing a lens cap because of the threads
i have had no flare problem with the optics
the unit reviewed is used with a nikkor lens mm
the problems havent occurred with other brands of filters on the same lens
after a frustrating  years with this tiffen filter im replacing it with a bwl purchased this polarizing lens but returned it today for a refund
as i rotated the lens to create a different look nothing happened
l have read the positive reviews on this lens i guess i just received a defective  one either that or these people know nothing of what they say
i have never had a polarizing lens fail as this one has
hbit buys the filters mm uv and polarizer  and for my surprise they arrived both with a ray in the glass
 they are of very bad quality costs much to clean them i have others of smaller quality and the polvopor almost does not stick they i do not recommend them are very bad and above they came failedalthough it is specified by panasonic this filter does not fit on the hdc sd avdc camera
the vendor did allow return but i had to pay shipping and was not pleasedthis filter is well made and the rotation of the polarizing element is smooth and flawless however while it fits on the tamron  zoom lens i purchased it for it does not allow the lens hood to be attached and so should not be sold for that lens
i was able to return it for full credit and purchased the sigma af ex dg mm polarizing filter instead and that filter fits and allows the lens hood to be attached
note that the tamron lens has its own filter ring rotation elementi tried every way i know to get this to thread on without stripping the lens including putting the filter in place and counterrotating it so it would click into place then i could thread it onnothing worked
i did gently try to force it to mount but it would just pop off
i suspect it was part of a bad run and it doesnt look like the threads are cut properly in the filterthe lens is a brand new canon mm
the filter threads in the barrel look perfect so its not the lens for surei pulled it out the box new and tread to put the filter on
no luckive been a pro magazine photographer for  years i know gearbad filteri see some others in reviews here had the same problem 
i rolled the dice and lost now got to go through purchasing all over againi need one nd filter so i choose it on amazon
but this one should be second hand
some paint was miss on it
bad luckthis product is not even worth a star first its not a  stop like they said it is a big huge lie
do not buy even if it for i got this polarizer filter thinking it did the same thing as a circular polarizer but its not the same
its a linear polarizer as opposed to a circular polarizer
if you have a dslr get a circular polarizer
a linear polarizer wont be able to meter or autofocus correctly
i didnt know this when i bought it and it didnt say anything about it in the product description
it didnt work on my nikon d so i returned itif youre shooting film im sure this could be a nice filterstacking two polarizers and rotating one should at a certain angle lead to no light getting through black dark nothing
not so with this one its very weak in this regard
this might be fine for landscape photography but in many applications a very strong elimination of reflections is desired
if this filter is weak why dont they say so in the tech specs
i bought some better polarizers and much more expensive ones which actually do what they are supposed to total black when stacked and turned in a specific angle to each otherive had to send this back twice now
there are bubbles between the layers of glass and the filter element
aside from the bubbles the unit looks fine and much like my other tiffen filters
my guess is this is a bad batch but be careful to inspect the itemi bought this filter and when i received it there was a little silver point in the glass of the filter
not usable
amazon quickly refund my money but im without a protection filter for my nikon mm g
i think tiffen never presents this type of problem
i live in brazil and here is too difficult to buy these accessoriesthis is a review of thetiffen mm color graduated neutral density  filterbottomline useless
it makes no difference for exposure
a cheap equivalent cokin works much better than thisthis filter is pretty much useless
ive recently bought a cokin grad neutral density  and is much better than this useless piece of glass
it makes absolutely no difference in my pictures while the equivalent cokin one works finemy suggestion is stay away from this and save your moneyokay so i dont believe that every nd filter from this company will come with  small cracks the entire length of the filter but mine did only on the coating
it still works because its so close to the lens it doesnt effect the images unless you shoot at f then we have an issuethis is just a pointless filter to have
it does very little for my sigma lens
i keep it on just to keep dirt and other garbage from actually touching the lens
the difference in photographs is so minimal to where it is not really worth the price
if you are worried about protecting your lens get a filter like this
as for it being a density filter i have not seen any results
i have owned other filters but find myself using them less and less since i have really figured my way around lightroomim confused by these reviews
amazon whats going on
am i wrong or does amazon have to pay more attention to these reviewsi googled closeup attachments and went into amazon
no i did not want a warming filter polarizer and uv wrapped into a  filter package deal
i wanted information on the closeup attachments that usually come numbered   and  indicating each filters relative closeup focusing capabilitiesthese reviews are a mixture of the abovepay attention amazon
and stop profiling my interests and saturating me with offers on items that you are certain i will likeall the while trying to make the automation look personal
do you people really believe that we consumers are that stupid
if all that selling is what pays for amazonyou can have it folksthe most important part of a camera is the lens
and in the lens is glass and the optics of that glass will in many way set the price and the quality of the lens
that is why proline models like the canon l series costs more than the standard models and if you compare them you will see a difference
one thing to keep in mind is that if you damage the image coming in to the lens the lens and camera cant repair it
the quality of the filter you put in front of your lens will affect the quality of the image you get
most filters even some of the top hoya are just plain window glass granted some are coated but the optics of the glass are still low quality
this will affect your image
if you are using a simple basic lens like a sigma or tokina then a lower optics quality filter like this wont make much of a difference
however if you are using a higher grade lens you need a higher grade filter
the only  ground glass filters that i have found are the bw and heliopan
they are more expensive but well worth it
you get what you pay fora uv filter serves a  fold purposest it helps to protect your lens and keep it from getting  scratches or damaged
i have seen a camera dropped and the uv filter shattered but the lens was still working and so was the camera
what would have happened wo the filter i dont know but i would guess it would not have turned out so good
i am often out in the outdoors and the uv filters i use bw mostly have protected my lenses from several scraps and scratches that could have cost thousands to repair or replacend the uv filter does filter out some uv light and thus you will see less haze in some of your shots
not a good circ
polarizer can also help in this matter as wellnote if you have a very wide angle lens like a mm you should get a slim model uv filter or else you can see black corners in your picts when you are at max wide anglehope this helpscons only cant find any pro yet
there are plenty of dirt on the lens itself
light scratches found on the side too
lucky me its not at the centergo get a better one
avoid this thing like plaguei got this tiffen filter to protect my new panasonic fzs lens and it has just proven that it cost  more than it is worth
i was testing the camera outside during the evening and as i focused on the city lights i suddenly noticed that the lights were bouncing off the filter and reflecting into the camera
i took a couple of test shots with the filter removed it and took another couple of test shots
when i downloaded the images into my computer there they were horrible ghost lights scattered in the dark sky over the real city lights and only in the photos taken with the filter in place
i know there is a technical term for them  glare or flare or something else
 and i also know that they shouldnt be there
this obviously means that the tiffen mm haze is worthless
i want something that will protect my lens but that wont spoil my photosmy fz which is my moms now has a quantaray multicoated uv filter that never interfered in my photos in any way
i looked for that filter on the web but unfortunately couldnt find it
by the reviews here i thought id be okay with the tiffen
i was wrong and must now look for a new filteri didnt get the chance to really try these out because one of the extention posts was defective
very aggravatingdont waste your 
im not a prosumer even but the blue ghostingflare is very noticeable on half my photos
this cheap filter is useless i cant see anyone using it for more than a couple of weeks
go for the better multicoated ones i dont know which but im researching it right nowthe filter arrived unopened but was totally useless it was damage with fungii bought this filter replacing a hoya that i had accidentally scratched
i received the product quickly but with small nicks and scratches all over it
would never recommend
im very dissatisfied
im expecting a full refund asapwhen trying to shoot outdoor photographs with this on the lens it casts a green flare sometimes across the photograph ifyoure shooting into the sun
it is great to shoot indoors with and if youre using it as lens protection it works well too but outdoor shooting id rather notthe lack of multicoating is inexcusable in the st century
a well built filter with good quality glass ruined by the lack of multicoating
if there is any source of light within the frame nasty reflections of that light hitting the filter will ruin your photos
pay a little more for a multicoated filter
amazon should be ashamed of insisting on this filter as suggested item to a lens purchaseone of my friends brought it from here for a new mm vr nikkor from d kit
after attached it to the lens you will see a small spot at the middle
he showed it to me for finding the reason
i said oh god remove it immediatelybut it is too late
the glass of the filter hit the glass of the lens
the filter was returned but the spot is still on the lens forever
 update one of my friend bought this filter for mm
again 
 the same problemdo not buy this junk  spend a little more and get better quality
i wish id read these reviews first
they mention that the threads on this filter are not well made i put it on the camera and couldnt get it off
took ten minutes to loosen it
i tried againthis time not tightening it
same problem
it is in the trash
i wouldnt even give it awayi got this filter for a mm  nikon but this filer will sit in my drawerfilter attaches well on the lens but you are now a happy flare owner
a lot of iti can now make the difference between a  uv multi coated filter and a  uv filteri will stay without it as the glass is very recessed on my lens anyway and the risk of scratching touching them is almost zeronot recommendedi know there are a few other reviews that talk about this filter creating spots on the lens
i concur with those reviews
ive used this with my mm prime lens and have gotten to the point where i just take it off before shooting as most of my shots would come out with a green spottint
i still keep it on for when i carry the lens around just as added protection but i doubt ill even do that for long as it gets tedious taking the filter on and offi got this free with the lens but even so i still feel a bit ripped offi have used tiffen for many years when i used film cameras
i recently bought an expensive lens and wanted to protect it so i bought this filter
as my title says it causes reflections and those reflections show up green
i know that with digital cameras you do not need uv filtering and i assumed that the coloration would not show in a digitalbut i was wrong
i was shooting into a glass door and got the perfect outline of it reflected back onto a dark chair
i especially noticed this when using my new k ii pentax camera body
it was less noticeable when using my pentax kr
i really dont want to have to buy some super expensive clear filterbut it looks like i may have no choicewhen i ordered my canon powershot sis  from amazon you recommended this filter both as filter and as a lense protector
naturally i wanted it
it arrived a few days after the camera which was not too much of a problem but the thing is a screw mount and the mount on my camera is not a screw mount
the size may be appropriate but without duct tape not a real attractive option it is positively useless to this camerathe mm uv filter would not fit any of three mm canon lenses in my bag
the threads are just poorly cut
in the mailbox for return alreadymulticoated lenses help reduce reflections off the filter glass something this doesnt have
it is almost guaranteed to detract from any image where a strong light source sun street lights full moon etc is in front of the plane of the camera
it will protect your lens at the cost of your shots
better to look for a multicoated lens
pretty easy to find for less than  in mm threadi cannot respond to how the product was
i didnt get what i ordered
i picked the product that i wanted with the aide of the discription and pictures on the website and made the purchase
amazon shipped me the wrong item via nd hand vendor
and because it was not their amazons mistake and i know it wasnt mine amazon is going to take the return shipping charges from the credit they will give me on the  day return policy
after much searching i found an email to lodge my concerns
i wrote an email to question them on the return policy and to my big suprise no response
buying from amazon was not the best choice in saving moneyi wanted to give a try to this cheap lens uv filter with my new canon ef mm  usmthe result was just dissappointment
i got lots of unwanted extra reflections on my pictures from light sources that were not even in the picture
reflections are immediately noticeable on low light condition picturesit seems a well built filter fits nice on the lens and it do protect it but if youre serious about photography and details on it should better get a bwbw mm clear uv haze with multiresistant coating mor hoya filterhoya mm uv ultra violet multi coated glass filter
they are more expensive but you wont get any unwanted results in your picturesi purchased this with a lens as i always need a filter to protect the exposed lens glass
the metal surroundthread on this filter is huge the glass is very thick and causes chromatic aberrations
as i used the filter i did not return it but i will never use it again
at the first opportunity i got an alternative filter that is light weight thin and causes no extra chromatic aberrations
this may have cost less than the alternative but it was not money well spentproduct review you get what you pay forcustomer supportvery unprofessionalif you go directly to their websiteyou will find out the true colors of their employeesi dont know why there are still lazy employees exist on this worldglass lense filter rattles in the housing
i am filling in with this comment to fulfill the word requirement
dumb requirementsince amazon offered this filter for free with thenikon mm fg afs dx lens for nikon digital slr camerasi figured why not
but just a few random shots taken from the living room sofa showed the prominent bizarre green reflections mentioned in the other reviews
even though they are most obvious in highcontrast situations bright lights in a dim room the same reflections must certainly exist in normallylit situations reducing image contrast even if no specific reflected objects are visible
for that reason the only times id ever put this filter on my lens would be for throwaway shots trying out camera features or shooting in dirty environments potential for dust or water spraythe image artifacts are so severe it makes you wonder if this was actually designed as a special effects filter with a reflectionenhancing coating
i cant imagine why a reputable company would put their name on this product  although the filter feels solidly built with metal and glass not polycarbonate construction its optical performance is atrociousordered a mm
this arrived in dirty condition
didnt even bother putting on a camera
returned for instant refundthe plastic box that this comes in allows this filter to move around inside
there is a little piece of foam only on one side
fail packaging
couldnt believe how dirty it wasordered a hoya mm
it doesnt slide around loose in its packaging
perfectly clean filter
that is the third hoya i have purchased
well worth the little extra i paid for themthis filter flares excessively and is unworthy of any optical system
all inventory should be recycled immediately
once again you dont get what you dont pay for
the clear nikon filter that i replaced this with functions very welli am a new to photography
my first tiffen uv filter came with a lens i bought
i was getting spot in my pictures
i later noticed the coating was coming of the filter
the second tiffen uv filter i bought with new lens
i was taking pictures of my christmas tree and getting red flares in my pictures when i did not have any red lights
i took of the filter and that got rid of the flare
now i just spend more and buy bw filterssame as the hood offered together with the mm lens it fits the hood but not the lens unless you use an adaptor which is not the idea
it is not for a pentax mm lensi bought this because amazon suggested together with my xacti  however it was the wrong size which needs an adaptor plus another lens cap
so i had to return it and buy a correct onei understand it was an automated system that amazon provides according to the orders but consumers must be very careful as well
i was in a rush and try to be hustle freethis filter is not coated and the reflections are awful
it wasnt worth returning it so i use it as a lens cap and take it off to shoot pictures
i got a hoya coated filter and it was well worth the extra moneyi bought this filter because it had good reviews and it broke during a flight i didnt even have the time to test it
bad qualitywhen i take photos with this filter at night there are strange light glares in the photos  ruining themi return it and will buy a real filter with real qualityprosthe packagingwas clean out of the boxperfectly fit my mm  afsconsproduces ghosting when pointed at lights this is unacceptable and the reason i give this product  stari suppose it does the job but its very cheaply madethe glass isnt glued or set into the metal so it moves around makes an annoying noise everytime you move the cameravery simple  dont not buy  it made in us but the quality is worst
you will end up waste your time to return it
i bought one from bestbuy i think the brand is call rocketfish very good qualitywith the assumption that  this will be a good protector for my lenses and and also a stabilizer for overexposed direct sun light photos i bought this filter
i should accept that it is a cheap model so i was not expecting much but something with admissible level of qualityhowever it turns out that the picture i took when this filter is installed has significant loss of quality and there was a distortion in the colori am not sure who can get any value out of this but i am not suggestingit seems like the glass filter moves around
is it suppose to do thiswhen i was cleaning it gently the glass came lose and now it just rattles around
its a piece of junki got this filter for free when i purchased a canon lens to take with on a  week vacation to italy and i thought what the heck ill give it a try since it was free
i used it for the first week of the trip and once my card filled up i transferred the pics from my camera to my laptop and i started looking through them
the pictures looked fine at first glance but when you zoom in on the pictures you can see that everything is extremely soft looking and if there is a light in the picture there will be glare or reflections around the light
i thought it was something wrong with my new lens which was odd because it was supposed to be a really good lens  and then it hit me the uv filter
i immediately took it off and went outside to take a few shots to compare with and without the filter
the picture taken without the filter are sharp and without glare whereas the ones taken with the filter look like they were taken with a cheap  pocket camera rather than a  semipro dslr camera
im so furious that the pictures from the first half of my trip were wrecked but at least a i found out about it half way through and was able to take decent pictures the rest of the tripjust look at the reviews   out of   are star negative reviews with the exact same complaints that i posted above and that should tell you something isnt right
i would guess that the majority of people who left a positive review for this either arent very knowledgeable photographers or they didnt really examine any of their pictures before leaving a review
i would return this filter if i could but it was free so i guess i will just throw it out or maybe just leave it on the lens as protection when not being used and then remove it when i take picturesas further proof that this filter should be entirely avoided a few years ago a rd party company did a study of  different filters from  different manufacturers and this filter finished in dead lastdo yourself a favor and pass on this filter even if you have an entry level dslr or are on a very tight budget because it will make your pictures look like absolute garbage
save up a few extra dollars and buy yourself a nicebw multiresistant coating uv filterorhoya pro digital multicoated uv filterwhich placed first in the abovementioned lens studyi dont like the threading too tight i dont like the lack of adapters for different sizes and i dont like the weird artifacts and reflections and glares i got from using this filter
my shots came out looking worse
honestly if youre going to use a uv filter for anything whether that be lens physical protection or better images go for high end brands
with filters its all about the price the cheaper the price the cheaper the qualityi recommend this to no one not even a newbiei bought this filter thinking it would be fine i bought a  filter for my  mm and its been great
i thought price wouldnt matter so i bought this one for  for my  lens
within two weeks it lets all humidity in and locks in humidity and water moisture
i literally cannot take one photo with my filter on
missed my return window by a day which is my own faulti am by no means a professional photographer
however i have used enough combination of slr and lenses to know that filters should not a create glare or reflections onto my picture
when i used this filter with strong light source especially with a flash i see in my pictures faint reflections caused by the light hitting the glass filter
when i take off the filter those reflections are gone
so the only time i ever used this filter is during evenly lit settings
otherwise its just a glass lens coverany lens that accepts a filter this large is fairly expensive
putting a nonmulticoated filter in front of it will badly affect your image quality
whyunlike film cameras a digital camera sensor has a flat glass lowpass filter lpf in front of it
a certain percentage of light striking this lpf will be reflected back into the lens
any flat glass surface in front of the lens will reflect back creating multiple images of the reflection
this is somewhat like the effect you see when you place two mirrors facing each other
you see multiple copies of yourself reflected in the mirrorfor this reason when shooting into any light source pros will not put any filter in front of their lens
look around you and you will see all sorts of light sources light bulbs leds in poweron indicators shinny reflections so you are almost always shooting with something in the picture that can cause ghostsif you must have a filter then it should be a high quality multicoated filter
the multilayer coating minimizes the reflections but doesnt completely eliminate themthis filter does not have multicoating and will create internal reflections ghosts and reduced contrast
i suggest you either get a good multicoated filter or go without
im a pro and no longer use any protective filters since the switch to digital
modern lens glass is far stronger than the thin flat filters and ive never damaged a front element in  yearsthere are others that disagree with my opinion but cost of a high quality mm filter can be over 
better to save that money into a lens repair fund which could be used for any kind of damage
a lens hood does a better job of protection than a filter and reduces flair with no side effects
i suggest bw brand filters if you must have oneand protection
thin flat glass is easily broken while a thick glass dome the front of a lens can be quite strong
so stories of a filter protecting a lens because it broke and the lens didnt are usually of little value
believe me ive tested this on an instron test machine at a clients lab
it is shocking how weak these things areso dont fall for the old camera store salesmans trick of suggesting protective filters
they were highprofit items and were ok in the old days of fragile lens coatings
todays lens coatings and glass are very durable and usually need no protection other than a proper lens hood usually included with the lensnot going to ever order another tiffen item ever
i put this on one of my favorite lens canon  for my trip to sequaiabig mistake
my hoya filer got cracked and in a pinch i went with the less expensive item
i have double glass flare and lens flare  on almost every shot completely ruined photo opsi was glad i had my back up lens  to take over so i didnt waste every landscape shot
that  was the first and last time i will ever do a nonhoya itemi ordered this to protect my nex kit lens and as much as i would like to know how well it works they sent me an empty package
i have the tiffen filter case and nothing in it
thanks for nothing
literallyi just purchased canons mm  lens and this came free with it
i said to myself well heck maybe i dont need to get my goto hoya multicoated uv filter this time
its tiffen the name is synonymous with filters  how bad can it be
well folks its bad
i only really experimented with it on indoor shots but the reflections and ghosted light blurs are just ridiculous
its almost comical how bad this filter ismaybe it is ok for some conditions but once a shot is ruined because of a uv filter thats it in my book
tossed it in my pile of retired photo gear and just pressed order on a multicoated filter
do yourself a favor and pass on this one
see my images for examples of the reflectionstiffen filters use cheap optically lowgrade green glass
get a hoya uv filter
its only  morei was trying to take some pictures of my son close to the christmas tree and i was getting a lot of reflections from the christmas lights on this filter
i had to remove it
im looking for another one
i dont know if they will all do this
i hope not
i wouldnt buy this uniti got this filter since amazon was offering it for free with my nikkor lens purchase
its junk
i was getting all kinds of lens flare and ghosting with it on
i will probably use it for my flash light mod one day to replace the plastic lensmounted this filter on a canon mm f lens
on semistrong light sources it has significant flare
removed filter flare went away
looking for a higher quality mm uv filter now
cant recommend this filter due to flare
check the pictures for this product to see flare and no flare example tiffen uv filter removed from lensit buys the filters mm uv and polarizer  and for my surprise they arrived both with a ray in the glass
 they are of very bad quality costs much to lompiar them i have others of smaller quality and the polvopor almost does not stick they i do not recommend them are very bad and above they came failedthis came for free when i ordered a mm f macro canon lens
it took it because when you sell a lens people like to see that it has a filter and its good to throw in as a bonus
that being said i wouldnt have paid anything for this uv filter
dont put a  piece of glass in front of a    lens
if you really feel like you need one try thishoya mm hd hardened glass layer multicoated digital uv ultra violet filteri bought two units of this item
i figured if one of them showed up bad in some way i wouldnt have to wait on a replacement
and yet both arrived with noticeable imperfections in the coating on both units
while i appreciate the discounting on the items compared to retail what good it it if i can see the imperfections with a naked eye and hardly trying
do not buy this producti am an avid amateur photographer for  years
i used this purchase as a test of economical filters
i have bw on all of my other lenses but for  i decided to jump in the boat with all those who say the filter is for mainly protection and does little to help your pics
i used this on the new s  tamron which i like for what it does
i now have bw on this lens and in my opinion it lifts a veil
even if not the pleasure of screwing that german filter so well machined onto your lens and realizing that you will probably never have to clean that lens is very reassuring and worth the price
i have returned the tiffen to amazon my fav online
associated equipment d   is phenomenal  is     ii
all of this equipment seems to work well but the l lenses are magical and the others serve their purposes nicely but  arent as consistent in giving great fast shotsi got it from amazon being a gift as a package
i put it on a mat with a dark background and it is reflective like a mirror
i didnt even want to use itmake sure you know the size before you buy
i apparently didnt
this is probably a great filterim sorry to have to return this filter  didnt even put it on the lens that i ordered with iti noticed several marks all in a line near one outside edge  and couldnt clean them off
i assume its a small scratchso  im returning it thanks to amazons easy process and will reorder another brand of potentially higher qualityplease do not buy this item
im all for filters just as protection for my lenses but this was the worst buy
i accidentally dropped my camera and lens with the filter from about a foot off the ground and the filter shattered not just crack i mean shattered
i spent several minutes very carefully picking the glass off my lens hoping that no damage was done
the glass from the filter put a very small nick on the edge of my  lens
the lens is still more than usable as the nick is very tiny but im more than disappointed in this product which is supposed to protect the lens not damage itplease look for a shatter proof lens filter before buying this one
its not worth the riskthis product was ordered and payed for by me but not received
i have reported this previously
but have received no responses whatever
please respondim totally devastatedwent on a pelagic birding trip took  photos and they are all fuzzyhazy because of this piece of crap so called filter
yes apparently you do get what you pay for
in the trash it goesjust went thru my pics now im writing this review for no real useful reason and then i shall go smash it to smithereenstries to screw on the filter but would not go all the way
it start binding after  turns
inspected it under magnification lens
noted the thread are slightly different in their pitches
i return the itemok it could happen i got the one bad filter on the rack but unlikely
my gear lens wise was given to me by my sister really sweet stuff awesome quality either she unloaded tons of cash on the lenses or the quality has dropped like crazy over the yearsthis really just a sup par product it gets stuck on the lens hard to get off then the build quality is just terriblethe glass seems pretty cheap but im probably gonna have to keep it cuz itll probably cost more than  bucks to ship it back well see what they say at the post officeive read a ton on filters for protection of my lenses  dont buy tiffen dont even buy hoya  spend the money on bw clear protector filters
they really dont mess up your images
the tiffen filters pickup everything and add nasty ghosting to your imagesdoesnt fit the panasonic hdcsd dv camera
despite the vendor says
they did accept return but charged me shipping
get it rigth panasonicgot this for my mm as protection
its well constructed and no issues with image quality
i was a little concerned with the thickness but no vignetting with my lens
get one
update july 
am disappointed with this filter
after some use i have noticed that the glass does not seem to be clean no matter what i do
used all sorts of cleaners etc but no effect
have been leaving it on instead of a lens cap but i take it off before shooting
have recently acquired a nikon nc filter that is head and shoulders above thisand well worth the price
lesson learned
will not make this mistake againi knew this was to cheap but this thing is junk
i have used tiffen for years but this is just plain junk
if i taped a nickel to it and threw it away at least i could say i threw something away
as a matter of fact i think i will
on every lens i used it on all canon l lenses the images were soft and it has a wierd glow coming from somewhere
beats me but dont buy it
i gave it a one because i think you have to give it somethingbeware of  assuming that  the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct  size
it wasnt even close
no size was given for the lense diameter
i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping  all the hassel of  packaging iti saw mixed reviews on amazon but went ahead and bought it
it turned out to be an item that was probably repackaged
someone else had a similar experience too
see review dated april  it had a long linear scratch one one side
there was dust
the plastic case protecting the filter had no seal and was fully scratched
it was an item sold by amazon so the return process was easy
but what a waste of time
i went ahead and ordered a different filteras someone else commented the filter was dirty with it arrived
this is not the first dirty tiffen ive received
my canon filters are always very clean
why cant tiffen ship a clean filterwhen i cleaned the filter with lens cleaner a black substance started started running off the metal ring
i had to wash the entire filter with soap and water to remove this
it stained my handsthe glass itself looks ok but stained hands from a new filter
not goodby the way amazon shipped this small filter container in a good sized box with no packing material of any kindi experienced severe ghosting when a light source was in my viewfinder with this filter on my tamron  f and canon  f prime both using different sizes of tiffen uv filters
removed the filters and the ghosting immediately went away
i replaced with premium coated hoya filters and have no issues
its strange because i didnt experience this problem on a tiffen uv filter i bought  years agocant be used while shooting it flaresuseless filter
very surprising tiffen would put their name on something like thisvery disappointed
glass slides around within enclosure and appears to have defects on edges of glass
will try to return but it was so cheap i expect i will eat the loss if they give me much hassle trying to retuni decided to try the filter in an old beckman uvvis spectrophotometer and replicate optical transmittance results in poland
sure enough tiffen and window glass appear to be optically related in transmittance of longwave uv
frankly ive alays had the impression that tiffen filtered images were less clear than bw and this kind of study may well explain the difference
heres a link to the original study results the glass did not fit properly in its housing
it rattled around inside the ringim sure it wouldve done what it is supposed to do ie
protect the lens but i did not even bother putting it on my camerai returned it and i am planning on spending the extra  and buying it at ritz camerai bought this tiffen mm uv filter for my canon mm is lens
since i got the lens i have not been getting the quality of shots i expected
long story short the problem was this filter
i took it off and instantly had the lens of my dreams
if you care about image quality you may want to reconsiderthe seller shipped promptly
i do not have a problem with the seller
unfortunately amazon had recommended this as an accessory for the camera i bought but it was not the correct size and i am unable to use it
it would cost more to return it than it is worthagain the headline says it all
i bought this for my vixia hf s
does not fit
kinda bummed ya knowive been looking for a good filter for my portrait lens and this one was recommended by a blog i follow
i was excited to find it for a good price and free shipping too
imagine my disappointment when i realized that every time i used this filter with my lens  the photos had a bluishgreen ghost in every image
when i take the filter off the ghost disappears
others before mentioned this same issue so i know its not just a fluke
the only good thing
amazon refunded my money without an issue
great customer service but awful producti bought this to protect my new panasonic lumix fzs lens
wifey is not too careful when handling cameras i hope shes not reading this
i wanted to prevent constantly cleaning fingerprints off the lens and the blamegame
when i took pics of some birds on a sunny day the birds were slightly off focus in many pics even though the camera has a terrific af capability
the pics did come out very nice except for the auto focus partindoors in low light the camera took a lot more time to autofocus than it usually does
once the filter was removed focusing was rapid
i think ill buy some other brandi threw it away
what a ripoffall kinds of glare and reflections coming from this very cheap piece of glass
i had to reshoot a lot of stuff because of my choice to use this filter
the amount of glare it picks up is ridiculous
it was my fault for buying it
i knew it had to be terrible at this priceif you have any doubt buy one and find out for yourselfthis product is  snake oil
buy a good filter or use your lens cap if you want to protect your lens
tiffen  trashi would rate it  if allowedmikeavoid this filter like the plague unless you like having ghosts flares and glares in your shots
i just returned from a trip to nyc
i had this filter on my zuiko om mm on canon d
most of my shots had very bad ghosting and glares
this is my fault for going cheap and not getting a multicoated filter
i bought this on a rush because i wanted a filter to protect my lens while in new york
in hindsight i should have waited and invest in a better oneon a side note i also used an inferior super takumar mm lens that didnt have any filters on
all my footageshots came out very clean without the above issuesmy advice to anyone out there spend a little bit more and invest in a multicoated onei know there are pro and anti uv filter camps out there
im just going to say this protecting the front element is an excellent idea
taking shots through this filter whatever size tiffen is a fairly horrible ideai did  simple tests one at a fairly close distance indoors with decent light and the other outside in daylight
both tests showed a great loss in detail shooting through the tiffen and very little if any loss at all when shot through a bw vs no filter at all
i also tested a uv heliopan filter on the same mm l macro lens the results were excellentwould i recommend a tiffen filter for front element protection of course
would i recommend taking pictures through a tiffen uv filter no wayit doesnt fit my camera  i wrote to you
you said to keep it and you would refund my money which i have not see either asyetcan you shine any light on this matter for me
thank youi have experienced tons of flare in my night shot photos and this is just too much for me
got this for free with my mm fd so no complain about the price but the quality of this filter is just horrible
well it is better than leaving my new lens naked but as soon as i find a good filter that can protect my lens in all day use this is gonna get smashedi got this tiffen mm filter free because i had bought a nikon mm lens
at first i thought this should be an awesome filter because it is made by a good company i heard about before but there is reflection and flare in your picture when you take them
so i decided to buy a different filter
i ended buying the sigma dg multicoated filter
just looking at the filter you can tell the difference in quality
when putting your finger in front of the sigma lens you cant even see the lens at all but do the same thing in front of the tiffen filter and the lens is very noticeable
i would recommend getting the sigma filter
it only cost like  more for something of way higher quality in build performance and sizeps
the metal edge of the lens even came a little scratched up which wasnt the case with the sigmahad to send them back  very disappointed
the polarization of the circular polarizer was okay  but as you dialed the polarization down a warm tone seeped into the image
so you either had cool temp polarized image or a nonpolarized warm image
i could only handle it for about  mins before i went back inside and removed the filters and put it back in the box
didnt even try the uv filteri purchased these filter for a simple nikon mm lens
advertised is that the kit includes uv protector neutral density  and fld filter which is true but the box says it includes circular polarized filter which is notthe case is horrible and arrived in bad conditions filter were full of dust and the fld filter came with a very big fungus that cant be removed because its inside the glassi think that this is my last purchase of tiffen filters
have many others for my  lenses and i have something to tell about each one
very bad quality
ill try bw and hoya next time
save your money and buy something elsei ordered a kit that included a circular polarizing filter
this filter was the main reason for ordering the kit but it was not included in said kit
what came in the package was the also advertised uv filter a fluorescent light filter and something else that i had absolutely no need for
i see that i am not the only buyer who has had this same issue
the worst part of the whole thing is that i was just outside of the day return period when i got back from my trip  during which i had planned to use the polarizer  and amazon made it seem like they were doing me a huge favor by making the exception to accept the return
they did not apologize as expected for what was truly an inconvenience
i will admit that the return was very quick but amazon partially penalized me in the process because i used accumulated points to cover part of this purchased
they have not credited this amount nor have they explained when it will appear on my balance and how i am to access thisto sum up this experience was a hassle
my advice is that readers purchase the filters individually even if it seems like it is more expensive and check reviews to make sure that there are no falseadvertizing issues associated with the product
this has become a common deal
i guess that amazon cant keep up with all of their rd party providers
but perhaps they can provide improved customer service weed out bad providers and prevent bad practicesthere is a reason why some things are cheap and its because they areummmcheap
bad frame uneven color on the glass
polarizing filter aside from having air bubbles on front glass almost falls apart
screwing and unscrewing them is a pain
if you are even a little bit serious about photography dont waste your money on this set
get yourself at least a set of hoya filtersbarely works as a lens protector
dont waste your moneythese are not multi coated i doubt theyre even single coated
i see theyre no longer advertised as multicoated
they were when i bought them
these are plain glass they reflect every thing a sheet of glass willwhy someone is trying to sell a warming filter in this day and age should indicate that these are old technology aimed at film cameras
digital cameras can correct for light sources so this filter is for the bin
the polarizer does polarize a bit
but not much
it doesnt handle reflections well at all
the uv is plain glass  it really is a jokethe pouch is a ridiculous idea
who can keep filters clean in a pouchmine were clearly used also
with scratches in the threads indicating theyd be installed several times before
the glass was also very dirty and was clearly handled by several people
im not taking stars off for the seller incompetence but the condition i received these in was unacceptablea poor product clearly returned by several others
look else wherei was hoping for something to help me steady a camera for telephoto shots but misunderstood how this works  i think some other reviews are misleading
i fail to understand how having something to put my hand though  and that i cant get my hand out of and that is like a stirrup on the right side of the camera is going to help
plus it makes it hard to make adjustments for shutter speed etci had a home network with my dial up internet access and when i switched to comcasthome was told to go out and buy a router with a firewall
i bought the dlink  in large part because i was under the impression that it integrated seamlessly with my cable service
setting up the port and attaching it to the pcs was a snap as was getting the network to work
in about  minutesi was up and running
however the firewall built into the hardware required constant tweaking to get things like mirc and other software programs that my son uses to work
the package comes with a quick start guide and manual but they were virtually indecipherable to me an admitted nontechie
after a few days of trying to tweak the firewall getting a completely unhelpful response from the tech department of dlink and emailing with some other users who had the same problems based on usenet posts i gave up and put everything back in the box
i ended up buying a simple port and using live alarm pro as my firewall
works like a charm
i will be selling my dlink  on amazon in a few moments if anyone wants a used one that is virtually brand newim really shocked at the positive reviews ive seen of this product here
i went through two of these units before deciding that dlink has a serious quality assurance problem and switched to linksys entirelyheres the problem
i set this unit up according to the very limited instructions included with the unit
it did not work
so i went to the web site and dug up some detailed instructions far more detailed than were provided in the printed documentation
by following these to the letter i was able to get the unit to workhowever this success was short lived
after a couple of days the wan link light just went out for no reason
i tried rebooting the dlink turning it off and back on and even turning off my dsl modem and cycling power up the way the faq on the dlink site had suggested
still no link lightsso i let the unit cool off for a couple of hours and tried it again
this time it worked
but about an hour later it went down again
the unit had good ventilation the whole time just sitting on top of a desk with nothing else around it
so i stamped back to the store and exchanged the unit for another one thinking i had simply gotten quotluckyquot enough to pick up a defective unitwell the second dlink did the same thing
please note that im not trying to do anything exotic here
i have  computers and one dsl modem
no hubs concentrators routers lans within lans etc
i was simply using pppoe on the wan side and dhcp on the lan side
pretty mundane stuffit was after this second failure that i exchanged the dlink for a linksys which i have yet to test
ill post a review of that unit once ive given it a test drive
one thing is for sure im done with dlink productsdo not buy this cd writer  youd be much better off with anything else
i had a hell of a time setting it up and after much talk with hp tech support who were no help i finally got it to work after barebooting my system taking my laptop off the docking station not passing through the usb hub and without task manager and any startup items
what a royal pain
everytime i have to burn a cd it takes forever
now its even refusing to work with my specialized setup and insists on making this noise ive never heard before
junkall summed up in one word is easy to do on this one bad
it has great and easy software but is a headache
the hardware is bottomoftheline misfit junk and screws up the computer very very badly
one time one of my computers was having a hard time starting the hardware
i ended the task and shut down and when it was started again it only started in safe mode never to work again
i ended up uninstalling every last driver and software and reinstalling it to get the computer working again
the warranty had expired so the thing got thrown in the garbage
i hope a compactor has flattened this peice of garbage
hp has absolutely no reliability
we tried an internal one of their burners before this and were able to return it
the internal screws the system up just as bad as this one
do not buy hp products
the only thing that they are even remotely good at making is printersthese arrived broken and cracked
only about  were usable
even the usable ones are flimsy and keep coming apart
terrible productwhen i started the process to get a replacement item shipped i learned  i must return the item
 i have no usable return shipping box since the broken item was shipped with another much larger item in a box far too large for the broken item alone
 there is no replacement offered for this item which means i must accept a refund and apparently order another item after amazon has received my returnthis is not the kind of customer service i had come to expect from amazon
i have previously ordered many products from amazon but i am very disappointed in this latest turn of events
a customer should not have to jump through hoops to get a workable undamaged version of the product ordered
its up to amazon to satisfy the customers need not the other way aroundthe undamaged case functions as advertised but the hassle to return the broken case is not worth it
shame on amazonok first of all the installation was a pain
windows  automatically installed quotcrystal soundfusionquot drivers on reboot and it was a pain to get rid of them involving me having to manually erase inf files and such
once the card finally was installed the volume coming out of the unit was very very low and turning it up caused distortion even though the volume was low
apparently the audioouts are not amplified in the slightestspdif was a joke as well
i could not get powerdvd to output to spdif in windows  even had the card set to it yet no audio to my reciever
what did work was setting my audio output to go through the spdif although you cant control volumes so the stereo signal goes through all  speakers at oncenot good at allin games the eaxad emulation is horrible
it sounds like the rear channels are playing more sounds than the front and the front is quotmuffledquot sounding i thought maybe i had connected the speaker leads incorrectly but doublechecking i saw they were correct
go figure
tribes  soldier of fortune and quake arena all showed this problemuninstalling the card was a pain as well
after i had used their own uninstallation utility for removing the software i put my sb live
back in and restarted well the sb live
worked fine but the stupid quotgametheatrexpquot icon was still in my system tray and in my control panel
i had to manually erase these files from my system directory in order to get rid of themoverall this card promises more than it can deliver
its pretty much a big piece of junk
im sticking with my sb live thank you very muchwouldnt hold any charge
tried several times packaging was questionable for a true canon battery
return was easy except i had to pay postagethe canon bp that was supplied with my canon g digital stopped taking a charge after  months and i hadnt used it all that much
to replace it i bought a couple of lenmar knockoffs for about half the price
since then ive shot thousands of images and the lenmars have never failed me
i went off on a trip recently and shot several hundred images on the first battery and never had need for the second battery or the charger which i left at homecanon puts out great stuff but i wouldnt bet my money on theamazon incorrectly states the following in its writeup under features compatible with canon eos d d d pro is g g g and g modelsthis does not work with the g model
the battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the g battery compartment
so if you need a lithium battery for your g look elsewhere on amazon
i noticed in the writeup from the manufacturer below the amazon description it does not list the g as being compatible
i wish i had heeded that instead of amazons description which is usually very accuratebtw i love the canon g and amazon toothis camera is too expensive
it is only  megapixels and costs about 
for that price you could buy  nikon coolpix  or minolta dimage  cameras both which are  megapixel cameras
i cant think of any reason to pay this much for this cameramaybe if it could take pictures and turn them into gold bricks
lol
is this a joke
this price will surely fall below  in the next year and you will save much money by waiting before buyingdid not arrive inside original kodak package as shown  just  loose rolls of film with no expiration dates on them
no doubt the expiration date was on the original packagingthe first one took me three days to get working at all played two songs and then locked up
three weeks later i still havent heard back from archos tech support
no matter as amazon did a stellar job as usual handling my return and i got a new onethis one worked great for two weeks once i figured out that the only way to make a truly useful playlist was to use a text editor and not to follow their instructions at all this is especially important because theres almost no way to play more than three or four songs without a playlist unless you keep all your songs in one huge directory and you dont have all that many songs in that directorytoday out of the blue again it locked up
no way to reset it nothing to do about it cant even reformat it and start over
and emails to archos tech support now bounce
and to think i had hopes of moving my mp collection there and leaving it there to free up a few gigs of my hard driveim not going to go through this again im going to move up to a more reliable unit this time
save me creative labsthis product has a very cheap flimsy feel soft grey plastic casing with poor all around designfirst i noticed you must pop of the sides to get to batteries those cylindrical sides in picture
this is fairly difficul and led to scratches on the case before i could even use iti bought one this summer and it broke under normal use in  days
i never dropped or mishandled it it simply started showing gibberish on the screen such as 
  etc instead of text even when i pressed keys in proper order based on memory it would not playthe sound quality was decent but not what id expect from such a relatively high price itemin my opinion this is not a good product which i suppose is to be expected from a no name brand perhaps they have improved it since june to address these problems but it is my suggestion that you save your time and money and go with a name brand such as creative or io magici dont know what to say about this item
when i place my order i was expecting something that work but when i got it sorry to say this but the item is deadno work using a celeron  and it takes  minutes to burn an audio cd
i have to use x because errors pop up at higher speeds
also it is very loud
i recommend a plextor x plexwriter
it is a lot faster and quieter
it took only  minutes to burn an audio cd at x with a celeron i bought one and then returned it  days later
i am very experienced burning cds  i have  burners  eide and  scsi and have and use both nero and adaptec software
i was unable to make a copy or create a music cd compilation from wav files
i tried everything
a dozen coasters later i returned it
get a drive with burn proof
my x liteon cdr with burn proof is blazingly fast and very reliable
i own other yamaha equip
and like it but was very disappointed with their cdrits sound quality is worse than all the headphones that i have ever used more than  at least
you are better off with a headphone that comes with such things say a cd playeraside from complaints about short range in trying to put a new battery in carefully i somehow managed to damage one of the battery contacts bending it downward in such a way as to make it impossible to reinsert a battery inside the small plastic transport
the tolerances are so tight inside that it could not accommodate the new battery inside the transport after the battery contact was bent downward
because the slot for the plastic transport is less than  of an inch there is enough room to insert a tool to bend the contact back upwards but not enough room inside to actually bend the contact itself
one attempted battery change and it was ruined
im looking for a nonoem compatible now
wont buy this junker again
first disappointment with olympus after an e and an upgrade to the e
olympus shouldnt neglect these little products but they did with this onei am finding that  of  dont work reliably
i purchased a crimp tool from the same dealer so that should not be the cause
i am finding that the connection may or may not work and nothing is visible to indicate the problem
plug the connector into the computer and then see if it works
if not then cut it off and try again and perhaps again
i make them fine with another tool and connectors so it is not usererror
i just have not tried some other connectors with this tool yet to validate the problem with the connectors but at this point i would not purchase these againi do not recommend this product
the flap does not stay down as good as memorex brand
i would rather spend more money on the better sleevesthis fan seems like a good idea but its design causes it to become clogged with dust
after a few months the fan wont be able to turn and it will generate lots of heat damaging cards near it
the fan housing actually started to melt before i took it out
this happened with  fans of this design
better to go with a simpler fani bought a new dell  that i knew would not have a parallel port so i bought this item to connect my laserjet l
while windows  did recognize the printer it would not work
attempts to print a test page just caused a ream of paper to be fed through the printer with gobbly gook printed on it
this must have done something to the printer because when i connected it to my old pc which it had been working fine with it would no longer print
i had to discard the printer and this cable
it was a waste of moneythe unit arrive overnight as i paid for
the unit looks good but it will not work with windows   this should have been noted in the advertisment
amazon too the unit back and promptly refunded my money
have yet to find on which will work with windows i purchased this item to connect my hp deskjet c to my computer running windows xp sp   i followed the instructions to the letter installing the windows driver for my printer to port lpt then connecting the printer using the cable and changing the port to the usb port
unfortunately every time i tried to print a document there was an error
since they dont tell you what error occurred and there are no diagnostics to find and possible fix something i finally had to give up and return the product to amazoni spent most of an afternoon searching for information on the hp website on the cables to go website and using google on the internet
there are apparently no other drivers available for my printer that would solve the problem or other information that i could use to make it workthis product may work very well with some printers but it doesnt work with my hp
i cant say if it will work for you but i would make sure and check return policies before you buy this product so you dont get burned if it doesnt workwrapping on handle peeled off after short time of use
not sure if manufacturing defect or if item was used or damagedi wanted to have a complete set of test probes and tconnection to use for my class because parts provided by school are old and not reliable
as it turns out i think i would have been better off using those parts than this piece of junk
i wasted most of my time trying to figure out my output was noisy or not present at all
i went over my circuit carefully and everything was connected correctly
i tried using different wave generators and oscilloscopes but nothing worked
i finally borrowed a tconnector and all my problems went away
this thing is so cheaply built that if you pull on the bnc connector just a little bit it comes apart
dont waste your moneythe first thought that i had upon opening the package was that it felt much lighter weight than all of my other power cords
the  ga construction is great for keeping the diameter of the cord small and the production costs down but i can imagine this being a poor cord for any application drawing more than  or so amps
that being said the cord arrived quickly and was promptly thrown into my bucket of dead wires to be torn apart later
the tight packaging of the cord caused a section of the wire to break and the product to become uselessif you need a longer power cord i suggest checking out your local thrift store
i found two  footers that were each  ga  for  bucks a piecei got a couple of these power cords for use on some pcs
these machines had sat further away from their upss than the power cords provided by the manufacturer would stretch so i figured id buy a few of these and not have to move the upss closer to the computers
i was totally stoked
i used them on two pcs and luckily i was rummaging around behind the computers and brushed up against the power cord
that sucker was hotas in burn your skin hot
they were limp and smelled like melting plastic
and its not like those machines are power hogs
i immediately shut down the boxes and moved my upss closer and swapped out the cords for the ones included by the manufacturer
i didnt feel safe leaving this product plugged into my computer and i certainly didnt want to deal with the fire hazard it represents
i shouldve known resistance in a wire gets higher the longer the wire and since resistance produces heat i really needed a thicker gauge power cord for it to run cool
perhaps these cords would be good for really light duty applicationsa word of advice be sure to check the cords after using them on whatever device youre plugging them into after a few minutes a few hours etc to see how hot theyre running
these cables could be a fire hazardupdate i was just getting the cords ready to send back and i noticed something interesting where the cord touched itself
the sheathing was brittle and the cord sort of fell apart
it actually broke in half
perhaps i should say that this product is a definite fire hazard
see photositem arrived i read previous reviews that stated it was damaged enroute so i felt for the damage in the molding
did not find any
my printer needed a longer cable so when i plugged it in nothing happened
tested it on a lamp the same
i guess cable is deadused as a replacement cant find the original
much longer than the standard plugs
worksupdatethis cord fried the motherboard on the pc
had to have it rebuilt
the power supply was actually meltedterrible product
the plug is not a standard one
the pins dont fit in any standard plugs in your homedid not work for me
the driver for the adapter installed automatically but the pc could not find the parallel printer connected via this cablebecause the power strip is so narrow its possible to insert a plug incorrectly with one prong inserted into the socket and the other prong hanging off the side of the power strip
this prong would be energized through the deviceappliance so you can get a shock from touching it
also the prong can touch the metal body of the power strip creating a spark
i think a power socket should be designed so that this type of accident is physically impossiblei have bought cables to go cables for years  excellent quality at an excellent price
i purchased three cables supposedly cables to gofrom marginmart fullfilled by amazon a m white usb ab a m white usb ab and a usb mini cablethe m cable is great no complaints it might even be the real thing
i knew i had a problem as soon as i opened the m cable  not white but grey
the two cables were supposedly identical except for the length but they look totally different even different connectors on the ends
the wire on the m cable is about  the thickness of the m cable same product longer cable  smaller cable
i dont think so
i tried hooking it up to my printer and immediately started getting printer errorsi then tried the usb mini which i bought for a backup hd
as soon as i plugged it in the hd started making beeping noises i have never heard before then refused to mount
hmmmbased on past experience with cables to go the junk i received is not their product but a super cheap knockoff
beware this vendor  this is not legitimate stuffwell there isnt much to say i purchased one of the  meter cables and it absolutely did not work
there was no visible damage to it so i had no reason to suspect that it had any defect but it most certainly did
i tried it with three different macs connecting a lexmark printer
none of the macs even acknowledged that it was connected
rubbishi suppose this is trivia but it was particularly aggravating for me as i paid for overnight shipping and made a trip to a clients house specifically to hook up their printer
i wasted time carefully running the cable along the wall concealing it a bit so as to be tidy only to find that it did not work and to have to remove it
i wasted shipping fees time and gasoline driving to clients home
further it was a bit embarrassing
of course im offered a refund if i return it i have it back in the box with its return label and such and it has sat next to my desk for weeks now underneath a pile of vastly more important things that need doing
i obviously dont feel terribly motivated to make a trip to the ups store to drop off a package so as to receive a refund of  suppose ill get to it soonthis product is very expensive
of course all tripp lite products are over priced in my opinion maybe because they are built out of better components then their competitors i do not know and in reality there is no easy way to prove that
however when i got this power strip i first noticed there is no surge protection
seriously
yeah i know it is in the description but come on
for  it should include surge protection
oh well just dont plug up anything to this that is important to you right
no
additionally the plugs are not widely spaced enough for bigger bulkier adapters which a lot of electronics have
so you may only be able to plug up half the devices you want
sheesh
talk about an over priced limited and oddly designed power strip
granted the cord is ft long but i dont need even a ft cord
and if you need it longer buy an extension cablei ended up going to a local home depot and surprisingly i find a whole case load of  outlet power strips by defiant for 
best of all all the power ports are spaced wide so you can plug in even the bulkiest of adapters
andit has a surge protection
wow
what a deal
the cord is only ft long but id rather have surge protection and widely spaced outlets
i compared the two side by side and the defiant power strip is noticeably longer because there is more room between the outlets
and it is in a heavy duty metal shell
sold
go to homedepots website and search defiant  outlet or sku pros looks nice and prettycons oddly spaced outlet
not suitable for bigger bulkier adapters
no surge protection
overly long power cord ft very pricey
twice as expensive as the store bought defiant  outlet which has additional surge protection and further spaced outletmy advice is to skip this overly priced power strip and visit your local home depot
there are way better deals then this guydidnt even work for meit would pick up sounds nothing specific when i put it between my lips and mumbled but other than that dudi ordered black and they sent me silver cant return because they mail it in a bubble mailer which must be ripped open
so once i buy a new mailing envelope i may as well keep the darn thing
i have a full cyber acoustic desktop speaker system that is great on sound and quality but its the little things like this that make loyal customers fumebecause vga is an analog format instead of dvihdmi digital connections vga cables must be treated with great care from manufacturing to use
unfortunately this cable wasnt treated well in manufacturing
the cable impedance is wrong which creates ghosts in the image
the mfgr tripplite well known for their inverters and ups systems tried to get by with thin cable which might be ok for a  foot vga but in  feet the cable degredation just ruins the pictureproper cable is  ohms for vga signals measuring this with a tektronics cable analyzer shows it is off by  and that the red green and blue cables are not all the same impedance they should be matched
you will not like the image at the end of this above x and even there it will be subparfor long vga cables look for thick cable  inch  heavy shielding the thicker the  better
on my unix workstation the  coax cable is  in diameter
the vga standard calls for  coaxes so you can see they are using skinny wire insideas the other reviewer said buy the best
forget the rest
i hope this review saves someones eyes out therejust incredibly awful quality
it causes ghosting and image problems that werent there before
considering it has gold connectors ive no idea why it just so awful
and yet i bought two and had exactly the same performance from both so its not just a case of one faulty cableavoid
run away
dont buythis mic works great if you talk with it in your mouth
once you move less than  inches away you can no longer hear anything you sayi just bought a spanish program to enhance my spanish skills so i needed a microphone to help me out with the programmicrophone is light weak and doesnt do too much for me
i would prefer a more heavy duty mic for anythingsecondly it doesnt work at all
i understand it is typically used for online chat and what have you but my comp doesnt even recognize it or hear anything when i speak to itobviously im not too upset because i paid a measilybucks for it but stay away from this mic anyway
its not woth the bucksoverall quality is very poor as wellwould not fit it was the right card but the space between the pin connector and the mount was too large
i was afraid it would break something if i forced it inthese things are cheaper than dirt and most work out of the box but this one didnt
ive used other inexpensive net cards with no problem and i like startech but this one didnt have what it takes
ill chalk it up to a quality problemthis device didnt work at all
also the driver disc doesnt identify which drivers are for which devices
ie the phrase sts is not mentioned on any drivers and there are a lotwent to their website and downloaded the drivers
the folder for xp was empty
even though xp is supposed to auto install this nothing i tried worked
refund was instant and i didnt have to return defective productthe title says it all
this thing is not well constructed and when plugged into my power system it plugs into a four pin connector it shorted out the system
the behavior was repeatable
i very much recommend you look for a different productmost slot fans arent worth a bucket of warm pithis one is
i ungraded my video card to a geforce gtx
that sucker puts out some serious heat and my hp pavillion case had no room for another case fan
enter the antec slot fan
its quiet quiet enough and does cool down my system update downgraded by review
fan grew increasingly noisy and died recently
had to yank it out and put in a new one same brand
guess what
started making noise after two weeks
returned it and wont try anotheri had it for a couple of months afterwards the noise of the fan gets louder and then dies
it was great at keeping my video card cool however not a very long life carddoesnt do much
havent seen an increase or decrease in air flow whatsoever maybe some one else may utilize it better but for me its just a space takerseveral months ago  i reviewed this item in detail
now here is my updated reviewabout  months after buying this thing it started to make a notoriously loud sound
it still works but the annoying sound isnt worth it
i didnt expect it to break as fast as it did
also since i broke it i got a much better graphics card the msi radeon  it  runs hot and this thing doesnt help much for higher end cards
a budget solution for a menial problem
if you have serious heat issues improve you cable management or get into liquid cooling  cheap junk like this just doesnt get the job doneonce was a  star review for a decent nicely price produced now soiled
 bucks down the drainthe unit arrived with tornpreviously opened packaging
the metal grill was detached and the unit was obviously used
amazon did not want the product returned and credited me for the purchase
i then tossed it in the recycle binthe description says that it fits any expansion slot
this is also stated on the product packaging
however it does not even come close to fitting my pci express low profile slotitem did not work  it made my system shutdown and not power up  i have owned a few   this was not the same part in the pic  i got a cheap non working part  the plasic was cheap and breakable by heat  if any thing i got a used one as newnope its my pc turning on
this thing is loud
i purchased this to get a little more air movement in my home theater pc which it does a fine job at
however i can hear my pc running from upstairs which makes it a really poor option for htpc
this item needs to have some form of speed controller built ini desperately need a way to cool down my new dell pc and have been keeping the cover off just to make sure the video card is stable
unfortunately the power adapter is the old style and my pcs power supply doesnt provide the needed connections
i am hoping i can find an adapter
i suppose i could always splice the wires myself which is what i will probably end up doingwho knew
they make an express pcima card so this didint work for me and i sure would like to return itim trying to replace my iogear miniview micro port kvm switch with a fourseat kvm
a four port version of the one i already enjoy from the same company seemed like the logical choice
turns out it wasnt
using the exact same equipment after reading the brief manual i installed it
my keyboard never succesfully transmitted a keystroke and my mouse stopped working between switches
i followed the manuals troubleshooting suggestions but they didnt change the outcome and now its going backthe design of this unit is such that if a surge does come through it may damage the protection circuit without you knowing it yet it will still pass current unprotected to any attached equipmentthis happened to me the unit caught fire and luckily didnt take the whole house with it
all attached equipment was destroyed
the warranty and insurance are too difficult to collect on
id have to mail all my equipment to them and they choose what to do yet if they elect not to pay out i need that equipment to make an insurance claim under my homeowners insurance
and yeah i dont have a receipt from a few years ago to prove im the original ownerdont let the metal enclosure fool you its a cheap surge protector in a nice case
a good surge protector will disconnect power to your equipment if it fails this one will notunit died
receptacles for appliance plugs are all dead
light shows line ok fault protection light is not on onoff switch is litcant even use as an extender because plugs are all deadprotected against surge but then was worthlessi purchased this power conditionerregulator recently
in testing i found that the output voltage followed the input with no apparent attempt to regulate the voltage
in talking with the manufacturer it turns out the unit does not regulate in the normal sense of the word  it has a huge deadband that causes it to ignore normal line voltage variations
i was seeing from  to  out of the unit
i would also note that the spec sheet supplied indicates that for an  volt to  volt input the output is  it doesnt to thati am planning on returning the unit asapthese headphones are awful
yes the construction is excellent and they are quite comfortable considering theyre girth but the bass is nonexistent
i tried them out right out of the box with my ipod first with some public enemy and then some guns n roses
they failed both tests epically
i didnt even bother to run them through some classical or jazz since even at high volume both on the headphones themselves and my ipodlaptop there was an abysmal response
dont waste your time
im returning them right after submitting this reviewi got this watch for christmas and so wanted to like it
ultimately i  returned it because of the following issues watch is a lot bulkier than it looks from the photos
this is a big bulky watch
dark background and contrasting numbers is far from easy to read as stated in the description
almost impossible to read in dimly lit environments
no way to increase the contrast
this was my biggest issue
backlight is very dim
you cannot even tell it is working except in pitch black environments
even then you have to squint to read the dial
many complicated button functions
be prepared to spend a whole day with the manual which does not come with the watch to figure out the multiple combinations that you will never remember
it might have helped to label the buttons
as is the labels are invisible as they are molded into the plastic and so small you need a magnifying glass and good light to even read them
a contrasting color might have helpedhaving the same problem others report  loses connection and have to recycle power
two out of our two units have the problem so its not a flukei purchased my first linksys router exactly the same model in  it was working without problems until december  long enough
having good opinion about the product i purchased again the same model
mistake  it must be manufactured by different company
front panel different with less information leds but i dont care
setup was ok then after about  hours it started resetting itself there were permanent losses of conenctivity i had to reboot router every few hours internet phone conenctions interrypted after few minutesi dumped linksys and purchased cheap dynex
no more problems
it seems that linksys outsources manufacturing to some place that manufactures trashmy second befsr just crapped out
probable hardware failure
about  months old
typical of linksys  no diagnostics
just several weeks of gradually worsening network drops freezes resets reboots and resulting hairpulling frustration disappointment
the only guess from linksys support all  port leds blinking is not a good sign  probably a hardware failure
on top of everything the webex hosted chat session with linksys support kept freezingafter  years of loyalty to the linksys brand i am throwing in the towel
this is the third time i have dealt with a linksys product failure in which there are no diagnostics no support no replacement
the user is left to their own wits dealing with the gradual peformance degradation and random network drops and freezes before the products premature deathi have one of these which worked very well for six months
at that point however it failed
be aware that if this happens to you you will be at the mercy of linksyss antiquated rma process
after spending  an hour on the phone doing several hard resets the very nice woman informed me that my modem had quotgone badquot and that the process of getting an rma number sent to me via email would take  days
she then informed me that i should fill out the emailed rma form and return it with the defective device
she said i should expect to receive a new device  business days lateri cringe at telling my spouse and kids that cable modem access will be out for the remainder of the monthall told they appear to have a well designed product that was fairly easy to get running
but i find their response to a clear product failure six months after purchase to be woefully inadequate
my recommendation would be to find another productdo not buy this router
it continually looses its connection to the internet
if you take the time to peruse the chat rooms at linksys you will find that this is a know issue with this unit and there is no solutionafter purchasing dlinks dwl wireless card and the dwlap access point i experienced a complete nightmare
i tried to install the software by first downloading it from dlinks website
then i followed the vaguely written instructions enclosed and made the network adjustments
my laptop computer crashed on the first restart
and crashed again after trying to launch explorer
the icon showed that i had full signal strength but my explorer now had a quotmodulequot error
my first reaction  uninstall the dlink software and start over
the problem it would not allow me to uninstall
wow
i then called dlink support and hung up after waiting a day on holdthe solution at hand  for some strange reason after having my hand held by compaq for three days of testing my win  os had unrecoverable errors
i was forced to restore my entire hard drive after transferring all important files to a backup drive
nobody had any idea what had happened
bad hardware
or software
what a nightmarewhat a waste of hardearned money
whoever designed this should be tarred and feathered
not worth half the price of a good card
i dont know how many public places it keeps failing in at school starbucks libraries etc greatest problem  keeps disconnecting then connecting then disconnecting  minute it says connection excellentmbps a second later low signal or no connection all while im sitting at the same seattable
very very annoying glad i have a xp os my friends with dells in windows  just love it when they have to type in the ssid every freaking time they go to a new place
too bad amazoncom doesnt have a  star rating for this product it deserves it
as you see from my name this looked like a hot deal but the only thing that got hot was my temperi installed two of these cards on my mom and dads laptops
one a compaq presario running windows me became completely hosed after the install software destroyed the registry
im going to have to reinstall the whole machinethe other a dell latitude running windows  pro goes into an endless reboot loop if the card is plugged in
both the hw and sw are junk in my opinioni was shipped a dwl which never worked from the moment i got it
i sent it back to dlink for replacement under warranty and have still not yet received my replacement unit
they tell me that there is physical damage to the unit and that i have to pay an additional amount to get the unit repaired and sent back
emails to the customer service department go unanswered
i recommend people try another company which stands behind its productseven though the name has not changed from previous version of the product firmware and chipset has changed
the cardbus adapter has no drivers in linux
better buy a linksys version  or other adapter and save timedlink has taken customers for granted very very poor driver supporti received the memorex mpdcp as a fathers day present
i have wanted a cdmp player and did a lot of shopping and comparing
i found that the mpdcp definitely packed a lot of bang for the buck
the included ac power adapter and car adapter kit tipped he scale in the mpdcp favor
other nice touches were the track display information which would display the id tag information on the lcd screen and the search capability where you could search an entire disk which could contain over  songs
by song title
in the real world the memorex mpdcp was a major disappointment
the buttons are laid out in a very nonintuitive fashion circular around the face of the player door
they are all the same size and shape so in order to operate almost any function you need to look at the player
this may not seem to be a problem but since i was going to use the device in my car and the included car kit would seem to hint that the manufacturer thought the same it turned out to be a major disadvantage
also the player turned out to be quite fragile and the antiskip feature was definitely not foolproof
it took a long time for the antiskip feature to load up and more than a small bump or two would cause hiccups
again a big problem in a car
finally a balky door closure system causes the player to report the door open and nonplayable when in fact the door was closed tightly
this happened on both units i had in short  my experience with this unit was less than satisfactory
ymmvas soon as i received this unit i plugged in the ac adapter hooked it up to my stereo system using line out and successfully played an mp cd that i had recorded
finally i had a means of randomly playing  of my favorite songs without having to use my computer
life was goodtwo weeks later i played the same cd and the unit would not work
it would pause every  or  seconds and hang up from  seconds
i thought perhaps the cd was bad so i burned another one
same results
it would play regular music cds just fine but not mps
i already owned  portable music playing units
i wanted to play mpssince the original packaging required  was a blister pack and is immediately destroyed when opened i couldnt return it for a refund
my only choice was to send this twoweek old unit to memorex for a replacement
if the replacement does the same thing i guess my only choice will be to throw it inand chock it up to never buy from the internet again lessons learnedi am absolutely disappointed with every aspect of this player
i am an engineer myself and i agree with other reviewers that memorex skip the testing phase of the design process
this unit is full of engineering flaws  what mp player cant support gtkps or vbr
i am more curious to know how memorex designed the buttonlayout of this unit did some just randomly picked out the position where each button goes
they are not friendly at all
this unit skips more often than a  cheap cd player not because someone bumped it but because of hardwaresoftware bugs
and what a battery eater a fresh set of duracell ultras runs only about    hrs my panasonic cd player last  to  times longer on a same set of battery
this unit looks cheap cost cheap and performs cheap as well  i guess you do get what you pay for
id stick with my solidstate mp players for nowthis is a cheap unit and it behaves that way
ive had trouble with the audio when trying to output dts
the audio was cutting in and out frequently
the menu system is also clunky on this model
i upgraded to a pioneer dvd
what a difference
its much easier to navigate the menus and ive had no trouble with the dolby digital and dts output
spending the money for a nicer player is my suggestion to youi dont recommend this player
my friend and i decided to buy dvd players and we both bought the cheapest available this oritron
we both spent agonizing hours trying to get the players working with our completely different tvs
neither of us could get them to work and eventually returned both of themeven if we could have gotten them to work the lack of information on the front of the player is really irritating
plus the on light never goes off and winks back at you any time you use the remote for some other device
but the worst thing of all was the nonreponsiveness of the buttons
i clicked and clicked and clicked and only a third of the time would the unit respond
this was true with both the buttons on the machine and on the remote
my friend had the same experiencei recommend you stay away from this player and spend a little extra money on something betterdo not buy this camera
the batteries die in less that one set of  pictures
the quality is poor even on the highest setting
dont compare megapixels there is a difference in image quality between cameras of the same resolution
the flash takes almost a minute to charge sometimes
and it shuts off after taking a picture
mine is a combination of defects and poor design
its going back
i made the mistake of thinking i could get a digital camera for 
you have to spend  to get a decent one which is just too much for the mass market right now megapixels for under price
sound too good to be true
it is
this camera disappoints on a number of levels
image stabilization is nonexistent
nearly every shot has some blur to it
the delay from when you press the shutter button is unbelievably long consequently the picture you take inevitably is never the one you thought you took
the flash is useless outside of  feet
the viewer cannot be seen outside in the sun rendering it unavailable for outdoor shots
zoom takes place in increments of x making it more difficult to frame a shot
i rarely make poor purchases but this one was a turkey
caveat emptorbionocular has marginal optics but its only 
that is not the problem
i used it once stored inside a boat cabin on a shelf no dropping or mis handling
after the second use  the right and left images were found out of alignment
impossible to re align
i would consider this a toy at best
you can not rely on it for any even mildly important application
plastic junk
i am putting it with my non working bushnell fx weather monitorall of the positive reviews really fooled me on this onefirst the item came prebroken
one of the magnifying endtubes was detached
after screwing it back on i discovered that something else was broken inside of the binnoculars causing a terrible rattle
so i sent it back for a refund
oh yeah and it was horribly packed and the us portal service had it for a weekbut that isnt the reason i am providing negative feedback
the thing is all plastic and not the good kind
the image provided is small and grainy  probably due to the plastic optics
the people giving positive reviews of the image quality have apparently never even used a moderately good pair of binnoculars
i am not talking about expensive binnocs the cheapest thing that nikon makes will blow these away
these are essentially a toy and i can see why amazon has dropped the price so lowi bought these binoculars based on the many fivestar reviews and the fact that they are from a reputable manufacturer
i immediately returned them because they were defective out of the box the collimation was off ie the left and right telescopes are not aimed at the same point causing the viewer to see two laterally separated images instead of a single stereoscopic image and not just a bit off but way off
the manufacturing process for this product must be totally devoid of any qa
based on the onestar reviews which i wish i had paid attention to before placing my order mentioning the same collimation problem your chances of getting a bad item are probably in the region of  in i received it on time and in new condition
i charged it for the recommended time and placed it in my camera
it only held a charge for  minutes
since i waited so long before using it i didnt try to return it
it was an old camera so i think after so many years it no longer functioned properlythe picture quality at the beginning was outstanding
real crisp and clear but over a period of a month little lines started showing up in my recordings
i was going to return the item but my return window has expired
i guess you get what you pay for
i do not believe i will purchase this item again in the futurei have been ordering this item for over  months once sometimes twice a month
in that time i had maybe two or three defective tapes
this last shipment the tapes had obviously being repackaged poorly i might say and closed with mailing tape
i assumed some kind of quality control had been done
boy was i wrong
 of the  tapes were defective plastic case crushed in corner or broken lid and in one case tape loose and off the spool
our nearest post office is over  miles away and so is ups
ups will not pick up from my residence unless i am present to hand it to them
so the nuisance value of a return makes this just not worth it
beware buyers you may be buying garbage
plus the item description says new and in this case it obviously was not true
what a disappointment in amazon
i have thought they were better than thati first rated this burner stars
now were down to one
see my update at the end of this review
sigh it started out well
the installation was a snap and burning my first disk went without a hitch
then i bought some bulk tdk blanks and well the predator doesnt like them one bit
burned about  with media error messages galore
coasters
switched to sony and memorex blank media and they both burned without a hitchfurthermore after some considerable time spent in experimentation its pretty clear that usb is never really going to support a safe burn of any type beyond x
you just get caught up in a world of underrunsthe usb connector in the rear of the device is flimsy
id say this one is only worth it for the crossplatform compatibility it does work as promised and its portable sizei did get this thing to settle down and it burns just fine though the x max
usable speed brings my rating down to  stars
ive been a cdr user for many years and id have to say if i was to rethink this purchase id go with a firewire based connectionaddenumwell this thing bit the dust a month ago
something in that flimsy rear connector gave out
i swear i was gentle on this thing
i move my computer equipment around my desk just a hardware rearrangement and when i plugged this back in it refused to work
iomega tech support was weak
essentially the rear connector broke
after all kinds of twists and turns i got it to work intermittently
i quityes it looks very nice and its somewhat compact
it was a big mistake to buy this product which i eventually returned because my system would not detect the drive
even after i removed all the software and reinstalled it
it still did not worki proceeded to purchase the hp conterpart of this product
it brings a seperate device driver disk which the predator doesnt
i then have an option to install the burning software that comes with the drive or you can install your own
the predator software is all bundeled in the same install which could be its downfall
the biggest thing that i noticed was that when the system first sees a new usb device and its looking for drivers and you point it to the cd it does not see any drivers on that cd
only after you install the whole software bundle will you see a drive letter assigned to your drive
but thats as far as i got
then i restarted the computer and that drive never came back
it was like the device wasnt attached to my computer
it might work for you it just didnt work for me on a newlly fresh installed operating system windows  se
my money is on the hp cdrw internal or external drives which are far superior from the rest
i love the zip drives but the predator just doesnt cut iti know these are old headphones but in case anyone is considering getting a pair dont
worst headphones ever
sound comfort quality horrible
simply horriblesimply put this card is not for xp usersi followed the included directions and installed the card drivers and the included configuration software
the installer did not work correctly and would skip the interface where i chose between quotinfrastructurequot and quotadhocquot modes
after i installed this software and the drivers the card would not work
it would lose the connection every  seconds
i could not change the network name i am using the linksys  port wifi router which i bought at the same time and the configuration software could not find any networks automaticallyi downloaded the appropriate software and drivers from linksys just to be sure i had the latest ones
after about an hour of deinstalling and reinstalling the software and drivers i finally installed just the driverswell now the card works but i cant use any of the xp built in features to find networks etc
for some reason this card leaves most of the palettes greyed out disabled
so this card is essentially worthless to me if i leave my homei am returning this junk tomorrow and ordering a dlink setup which i should have done in the first place
arghafter min on hold linksys told me that st card was defective one week later got new one and was after  hour of struggle able to install under winxp
linksys webstie  has basically zero info on using their products wwinxp and the wpc xp driver was written in jan and not updated sincea friend had similar probs and had to get a nd card also
on my pc  after  min or so using wireless card pc freezes and must be rebooted
no explanationif i had it to do again i would have looked for a product with better win xp support
i regret this purchase the functionality has not been worth the paini purchased this just a couple of weeks ago
thought the price was good and the reviews made me decide to buythat all changed once i tried to install the pc card in my nt laptop
it would not install no matter how many times i tried
the documentation for this product is weak at best
if you simply follow the documentation you see when you open the box it will be wrong for nt
however they dont tell you that until you call them for support
that brings up phone supporti literally spent over  hours with their support reps  and still do not have the card working
after a certain business hour they shift calls from irvine ca to a call center in the philippines that is useless
if you have to call tech support make sure you are talking to someone in irvine
though after a couple of hours on the phone with two guys from irvine the card still didnt work
they ultimately told me they thought that the card was bad
amazoncom was wonderful and shipped a new one the same day
however the new card was no different from the original and still wont work
it has all been returned to amazoncom for a refundthe wireless port router was easier to install but still required a minute call to tech support to get up and runningin short amazoncom was great but linksys on nt is worthless
independent of the os this is a poorly documented product with tech support people that are trained from a script and not able to solve your problem if it varies from that script
this review is based on multiple calls speaking with several different techs using the term loosely as i dont want insult professionaly trained technical support reps in irvine and the philippinesthe hardware itself looked first rate and seemed very durable but i cant speak to any functionality
i am out over  hours of my time and very disappointed with the whole linksys experiencestay away if you run ntim sick of always getting book reading foreigners as tech support
give me a breakthe woman i talked to had me reinstall the card doing exactly what i did the first time
when that didnt work her solution was to reinstall windowsgeniususing windows  by the way on an older compaq laptop by the wayi bought this card and within  hours of receiving it i was contacting jampr for a rma numberinstallation was fine with my windows xp laptop but using it was another story
anywhere in the house even two feet from my wireless router there was no signal
this was odd considering i had  computers at seporate ends of the house successfully receiving full wirelessb internet access
so i gave up and for the heck of it slid a netgear card in
well it worked great
i could be anywhere in the house and receive near linkqualitysignalif youre in the market for a card like this i would highly recommend going with its netgear counterparti made a few changes to the card settings in the configuration utility that came with the card
it has not worked since
i changed the settings back the way they were in the beginning
ive uninstalled and reinstalled the softwarehardware a half dozen times and ive still got problems
it shouldnt be this hard
there have to be better wireless cards out therecan i just put in my vote for the single worst product of the year
sheesh  i have a linksys wireless router and a linksys wireless card
and im a computer professional
this should be outofthebox easy to set up  maybe ask for a quotpasswordquot on one side and a quotpasswordquot on the other
but no
i have to know about wep encryption encryptityourself
its more fun that way
and subnet design and even then it doesnt work
worst of all the software gives no information about why it doesnt work  theres no log no error messages
just a big nothing
even after i got it working beats me how i just poked and prodded forever the quotconfiguration utilityquot that sits in my task bar does nothing at all useful
if i go to an airport or to another spot with wifi access i have to go into the cards configuration properties reset a bunch of stuff with no opportunity to save my existing settings
 and hope that itll work
all in all a very frustrating product
good luckalthough it installed flawlessly and worked fine with the linksys base it made my laptop toshiba tecra  winxp freeze at random intervals at one point every  min or soi have had lots of problems with this card and i have still not gotten it to work
i have an ibm thinkpad a sony vaio and a powerbook g
this card doesnt work in any of them
i have followed the instructions very carefullyan important note here the windows  instructions are downright wrong and make no allowances for differences in system configuration for example insisting that the cdrom be d as opposed to e
there is no installer on the cd and windows wasnt able to find any drivers on the disklinux is another story
the card does not seem to power up correctly so the linux kernel module cant seem to talk to it
this is probably due to the poor fit of the card in all three of my laptops
ill get into that in a momentin macos the card powered up the powerbook has a very slick pcmcia dock so that doesnt surprise me at all
however there are a no drivers and b it doesnt even attempt to identify itself as  of the other pcmcia cards out there doin general this card has been bad news and im not sure what to make of it other than chalking it up to  down the draina further issue which really prevents me from ever wanting to buy linksys hardware in the future is that the card just doesnt quotfitquot right into the vaio or the thinkpad both very mainstream expensive laptops
it is necessary to push the card in so hard it feels like the antenna may break off
this is a horrible way to manufacture a productlastly and mostly least is the fact that the card comes with no case whatsoever
because it has this huge antenna sticking out the side it could be easily broken by leaving it in the laptop when moving the laptop around which you do with every other card right
your only choice is to continue to use the static baggie that comes with it or improvise somethingoverall the implementation and conception of this product is poor at best and i will never buy another linksys product again
its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptopsi used this card under windows  accessing a dlink wap
installation setup configuration and speed were excellent
i was averaging about  link quality and around mbps transfer between pcs
the dlink was connected to a cable modem and speed was amazing
i just got an xp laptop and started using this card
performance has dropped to aroun  link quality and maybe mbps data transfer
its almost like being back to dialup
the drivers released for xp   ive tried reinstalling using the config utility not using the config utility you name it
i have a small condo and im about  feet from the wap as the crow flies
i have a few walls between me and the wap but that was no problem under wink
im very disappointed in this thingusing this card with the linksys wireless cabledsl router and access point the best i could manage in my house was  ft from the access point practically useless
i returned the card and got an orinoco silver card for 
it has about twice the range communicating with the same access point and i can now use my laptop anywhere in the house
no compatibility problems either i have win on both machinesbuy the orinocoa new version of the card is on the shelves now version  that has more problems than any previous version i have played with
i am a network engineer and i have had previous experience with b gear in the pastthe documentation that comes with this card is incomplete
i cannot get the device to send data to either of my befws routers although it shows that the link is valid
no setting change would make this betterforget about linux support for the v card
i cant get windows to work with the card and linux seems to have a problem with the cis
maybe it will change sometime but what i get from the linux wireless development groups is that no plans are in place to make this card work
the previous versions do worki have had this card for over a month and have yet to get a live body on the phone or a response from linksys via email regardless of the number of requests i have made for simple answers to questions such asquotwhat configuration must my linksys befws and wpc card have for the two to communicatequotamoungst othersmy suggestion dont buy anything linksys
if you do pray that it works as intended and out of the box
it doesnt matter if you do it for a living or if you have experience with the type of gear you are buying
go with another vendorupdated  in retrospect my problems were due to trying to use this card with novell and my vpn client plus wireless was still a little new at that time for my ibm thinkpad
today the is standard technology cisco has purchased linksys and significantly increased overall quality and wirelessb is outdated anyway
 i purchased this card in november and experienced some problems setting it up that i needed to call tech support for
on my third call the operator felt sorry for me and actually helped me more than any support tech ever has  calls and counting
i got it to work and it ran great for about three months
then while trying to set up my vpn client it stopped
went through  uninstallsreinstalls with tech support before finally they told me the card was bad and sent me a new one
so far i have been unable to get it to work after more problems simply installing the driver
tech support tells me it is a newer model card that may not be compatable with my laptop computer win setop of the line ibm thinkpad
so far have been trying since february to get it working again and am about to give up and get a refund
of course im still stuck with a hubrouter that cost me twice as much so i could get the wireless feature
who knows if it is the product or not but i can say that linksys tech support is absolutely the worst ive ever dealt with in  yearsi have a linksys wap and two linksys pc cards
i have had all sorts of  problems with the cards including severely limited range i couldnt get a signal  feet and two walls away instability of the driver software necessitating twice daily ejection and reinsertion of the card and standby problems with windows i borrowed a lucent now orinoco wavelan card and what a difference
i now get full signal anywhere in my house ive never dropped a connection and standby now works correctlyi still like the linksys wireless access point but i think you should spend your money elsewhere when purchasing the cardsthis product has awful support for windows nt
after installing the produt the instructions said to reinstall all service packs
but my regular wired network card was no longer working in order to download the service packs
this install totally hosed up my pc
i got my pc back in shape and then installed the netgear card of similar stats without any problem
linksys should not claim this card has nt supportsignal strength starts to drop off after just  feet and the access point seems to randomly lose contact with the internet even when wired connections using the same lines have no problems
extremely frustrating  you need to reset the connection frequently and on an hp pc with xp using repair connection seems to hang the system more often than fix the problem
im in the market for something  anything  elsei bought this card together with a linksys wireless access point to replace an older dlink combination
tried to install it on my laptop under windows xp
the bottom line
after  hours of trying multiple visits to the linksys website multiple converasations with their tech support installing new drivers installing new firmware attempting to reinstall it more than  times i gave up
reinstalled my old stuff and sent this thing back
the most aggravating part was tech support
all i got was quotyou need new driversquot even though the stuff was brand new
the install procedure in the manual is wrong according to tech support
how can they sell stuff like thispurchased to use with a toshiba satellite s
computer locked up anywhere from immediately to around an hour when using the linksys wpc
after doing a little research which i should have done in the first place it turns out that there is a history of trouble with this card and toshiba laptops
i like my linksys wireless router but the network card continued to cause problems and has since been returned
my advice is to stay away from this card if you have a toshiba laptopim writing this review while waiting on hold for technical support
this is actually the third time ive called technical support today on the first call i held for  minutes before being unceremoniously dumped the second i was rudely disconnected after  minutes
anyway i followed the written instructions for the installation of this product to the letter
it didnt install as indicated on the instructions
a perusal of the linksys web site was met with equal frustration
i was doing all these things while waiting on hold
in fact i wrote this email to linksys during an earlier frenzy of frustrationquotive been trying in vain for over  hour to install my wpc in to my new dell inspiron  laptop
i followed the enclosed directions to the tee
the installation did not go as you had documentedi called technical support and after  minutes i was told the quotthe average hold time is  minutesquot one hour later still no one answered the phone
while i was cooling my heels waiting for some help i tried installing the drivers by going through the supplied cd and installing where i could find itthe pc card still did not worki am now calling amazoncom to return this item
when asked why im going to tell them that your support department sucks
you dont answer the phone your support search engine doesnt query such words as quotdriverquot or quotinstallationquot
i therefore have concluded that if you support is any indication of the quality of your product then i seriously doubt the stupid thing works anywayhave a nice dayquotin closing i must confess to exaggerating my evaluation of this product
in giving it one star im being far too generous
unfortunately amazon doesnt offer me a lower choicei bought this mouse to use with my laptop which only has one ps port and im using that for an external keyboard
so i needed a usb mouse and figured that microsofts optical mouse would be a good choice
wrong
windows  had no trouble recognizing the hardware and the software installed fine but with the correct driver installed the mouses movement was totally erratic
just to be clear i already have a logitech cordless optical mouse on my desktop pc so this was not a question of getting used to an optical mouse
the microsoft mouse simply refused to work properly on all types of surfaces
after  minutes of trying very hard to adjust the speed and get the thing to go where i wanted it to go i gave up
i should have paid attention to the reviewers here who warned about the poor quality of this product
im returning it to best buy tomorrowive used logitech thumballs for cad work for over  years
ive bought at least a dozen including every logitech model except the most recent
the curent logitech trackballs thumballs are too small for a normal sized hand
i cant imagine what kind of computer user they based their size on
their previous model the logitech marble is what ive used for the past  years is almost large enough not quite but it works
but when a button started getting flakey i had to find a new one
as i said i believe the current logitech models are too small so against my better judgement i bought this microsoft trackball
it is large enough for my hand
the extra buttons are useful but would take some getting used to
but all of that is irrelevent
the ball simply does not move smoothly
it sticks and is generally heavy
the ball on my  year old logitech feels better
some other reviewers mention the ball riding on plastic nubs however this may be a newer model as the ball definately rests on three metal posts
that is just like the support on my old logitech ball but there it works the microsoft trackball doesnt
an associate bought one at the same time and it feels the same way
along with the other reviews mentioning the same problem i would have to conclude that the sticky ball is endemic to the microsoft trackball and could not recommend it under any circumstancesbought this one for 
after  minutes of use the smoothness of the trackball was gone made it useless
threw away in trash next day
dont buy itcount me along with those that dont like this trackball
i made the switch from the conventional mouse when i started to notice my wrist aching
the thumb control seemed like a good ideai like the ergonomics of this trackball
the buttons are well placed and the scroll wheel works great
but this device fails miserably in the most important area  the trackball itself
quite simply it is not smooth
the motion is jerky making it difficult to get teh cursor on words when editing type
i do a lot of word processing and cut and paste throughout the day
this is a nightmare with this unitgunk quickly gets caught up inside the ball cradle which must be cleaned daily
and i thought the opticals would be maintenance free
i am always taking out the ball and wiping it down to try to make it spin smoother
it works for a bit and then i am back to the jerky motionmy best advice which i will follow from now on it try it before you buy
not recommendedi have owned this for years and simply love it  best mouse ive ever had
i just dropped it and the scroll wheel no longer turns so i thought id look for a replacementi can guarantee you i did not pay  for this
its been a while but id bet i paid less than  for it
no way will i pay  for a mouseso if anyone knows of a cheaper place to get this or a good replacement id love to hear about it
thanksif u have huge hand get this
else dont bother
i have medium size to small size hand and using this mouse actually hurt my handto call this input device a trackball is misleading
it does not track very well at any resolution setting
you must install the intellimouse software in order to change the default button positions which places what we all know as the right mouse button to the left of the ball
this is simply stupid and i cannot imagine that the engineers who designed this input device actually use this aging product anymoreif you have windows xp the builtin mouse driver with its welcome highlyprecise tracking feature will be replaced and turned off with the intellimouse software which also has a slightly different acceleration scheme and is a lot less precise
unfortunately you cannot use the builtin windows xp mouse driver unless you actually want your right mouse button to be assigned to the upperleft mouse button
the shape of the housing is very comfortable for righthanded users only
southpaws cannot comfortably use this device in any fashion
the housing fits my right hand so well but the perspiration can be troublesome since your entire hand will be flush against the unitwhen this model first came out several years ago it was over seventy dollars
get it under promotion and you probably wont be disappointed but i think the twentydollar logitech marble mouse is a massively higher quality and more useable product than this onei think its worth mentioning that the ball socket is lit up by several leds that are only activated when you install the intellimouse software
if you dont install the software you only get one light and a stupidlyplaced rightmousebutton on the leftim writing this with the aid of my beloved logitech m wireless trackball which cost well under 
it works ideally for my normal pc  notebook applications with only quick monthly easy cleaning in my dusty house
i dont care how good it is a  wired trackball just aint worth it unless money is no object
i could buy  of mine for just  of those and it would still be wired a definite disadvantage
are you guys who favor them nutsas a trackball user ive been happy using my first trackball a logictech
one of there first i believe
it simply wore out and i replaced it on november  with this microsoft trackball
i was at first happier than a new kid with a bike
i could go anywhere with it and finally somebody decided that using the internet does indeed have different demands include a forward and back button on the mouse
 months lateraround april or may  i removed my dead mouse
it became unstable and wouldnt function at all
microsoft fed exed me a brand new replacement
now thats service
on november   this replacement mouse also became unstable and i had to remove it i cant do graphic work with a mouse that wont function
but this time i have already ordered a nonmicrosoft trackball
they do need to perform a final test on this series of mice
 months is way too short for a  mouse
no i have not contacted microsoft
id never hear a word
i wont waste my time
i really wish this mouse would last
it incorperates many fine features that make it a mouse of choiceive been in the technical end of the computing business for over  years  done a lot of networking  thought it would be nice to add wireless capability to my home network so purchased the wap  wpc the pcmcia wireless card that goes with it
software installed ok  got it to work
the problem is that the wap has no useful range
as long as you are located in the same room and have line of sight with the wap its ok if you go out of the room or any way get out of the line of sight even the next room the signal quality goes to poor and the link drops
i have regular normal wood and sheet rock walls
packing mine back up for returningdoesnt work as advertised
very dissapointingi bought two of those and i could have written a  star review back then like many people did
out of the box its a joybut after less than  years the failed one after the other and linksys support said this was common hardward failure
a big waste of moneyi bought this thing and a linksys wireless card as well and set it up and configured it and everything setup perfectly without a hitch
however the computers wouldnt connect
when i tested with a script that pinged the computers across the wireless connection i had  packet loss at  feet
when i moved the computer from the office to the living room i had  packet loss and  percent poor signal strength  only two rooms awayemail to technical support went totally unansweredso i can only assume that this product is a joke and that linksys will put out a real product soon and apologize for ever shipping this thing
id give up on them completely if their dslcable router wasnt such a great producti ended up having to return my access point because it would lock up soon after i established an ipsec connection through my vpn software
this happened even after i upgraded the firmware bought this with the card from the same company before reading any of the reviews posted here
after setting it up i returned it immediately
even in the same room with the card directly pointed at the ap i never ever got a  linksignal qualityonly about 
whats up with that
i think this is the fault of the cardnot the ap but i decided to return it anywaysthe wdt will work if you buy the wpc version  the problem is no one sells the wpc version  the current version of wpc is version  and linksys customer service told me that version  doesnt work with the wdt it works fine in a laptop
linksys customer service recommended the newer wmp card which is made for desktops
this wdt is an adapter to get the laptop peripheral wpc to work in a desktopthe unit is very easy to install and works right out of the box
given the prevalence of wireless devices switches like this are indeed coming down in price and make for an easy addition to any home or small business networkhoweverwithin  months of my purchase the uplink port  stopped working
after much troubleshooting with their technical support unit i was issued an rma without any argument
somehow the rma was enter twice and i was sent a second unit as well
this took some time to convince customer support that they had screwed up and i wasnt paying return shipping for the nd unit
all was cleared up eventually and the replacement began working immediatelyabout three months later the same port died and once again i had to go through the horrors of their support staff
after three hours on the phone with their technical support staff customer service and two supervisors i eventually got another rma
i am currently awaiting the third replacement nowits worth noting that they attempted to blame the cause of the outage on a faulty router attached to port   that is until i informed them that the router was a linksys wrtgl that has been working flawlessly since its installation
replacing the switch was cheaper than replacing the routerits a star switch when it works
but my expectations for its longevity are very slimedit  i received the third replacement unit today and as i feared it has the same defect
of course linksys will not refund any money at this point so i can purchase a working unit
looks like im just going to be put out for the replacement cost of a functional switch
this is most certainly the last linksyscisco product ill buyi bought this linksys etherfast  port workgroup switch from amazon for my small business office
it worked for  months without any issue and it stoped working since then
have to call customer service couple of times they told me to send then back for a replacement without even they paying the shipping cost
i decided to buy another replacement switch instead of getting an old replacement from linksysthis is a nice compact unit with pretty blue plastic and a lanyard so you can hand it on your neck
thats the end of the positivesthe big really big negative is that this thing has such poor sensitivity that unless you live in the desert and no bird or plane ever fles over you you will have problems getting it to work because it will not find satellite signalsok mild exageration
i live in midmichigan and it actually has found enough satelites to work if there was nothing above it
however the moment you go under a tree any tree you will lose your signal and you will not get it back until you move out from under the tree
i think that if you put your hand over the etrex legend you will lose your signalthis thing is well named because a legend is often a myth and not based on fact
it is certainly a myth that the etrex legend is a useable gpsgarmin should be deeply ashamed for selling such junkive owned the original etrex two different etrex legends and the highsensitivity venture hc
this legend adds some functionality to the old basic etrex such as basic maps and longer waypoint names but is obsolete when compared to garmins new high sensitivity etrex modelsthe problem i have had with both my etrex legends is signal acquisition
both legends have had a problem acquiring and keeping signal even in wide open places with a perfect view of the sky
at times it simply refuses to find any satellite at all
at first i thought i had a faulty unit
but my second legend has the exact same problem
more than once ive had the legend fail me at a crucial time when i really needed it to work
its pretty frustrating
i never had this problem with the original etrex or the venture hcoverall this has been a device that is great in concept but very disappointing in reality
i would strongly recommend skipping this unit and buying the etrex venture hc or another newer model with the high sensitivity receiver
the hc has great signal performance even in rough terrain
it has a color screen basemap long name support and sells for about the same price
i think youll find the difference in performance to be night and dayits not about the gps or that it only holds mbs of memory not a stick upgradable option but built in or it only locks onto a satellite if u r standing still in the middle of a football field but most computers today come with one  female pin serialport plugoutlet for pc to a majorvital peripheral hookup or  get your printerscanner or fax and use it for your gps hook up and buy their map disks at  ea
but dont buy them all or your memory would have to be in the gbs range
if u have a pc with any peripherals like a printer that only port is used so no luck dling garmin  software
most newer pcs come with several usb  ports or a cheap hub turns  usb outlet into many outletsinputs so why is garmin selling a gps kit for around  with the only way to get jack from your pc is thru a sp connector
if u want a usb that works to dl maps think around paying  more for this usb to rs converter cable which it should have come with for the price but didnt
so i have a cute hand held gps that only shows me major roads has a menu that takes days to figureout and setup then lacks memory has no way to up that memory with a gb card and flogs an ancient sp hookup with no cd map disk teasers to joe public
clearance time or pp planning
my buddy saw my frustraion and asked me why i had bought a garbage gps he is a pilotspokane wai bought this unit from anonymous bigstore and the salesman did not have the knowledge or the courtesy to mention that it was already obsolete
when i got it home and took it out of the box i discovered  that on a clear day on a hilltop with no obstacles anywhere it could not locate satellites and  the computer interface was an rs cable
no usb
ridiculous
i went to garmins site we already have two of their navigators in our cars with which we are very happy except for the price of maps to see if there was any way to improve reception and that was when i discovered that the unit was an old model
the new model has usb and improved reception
this baby is going back and i am going to protest their  restocking chargebtw i thank amazon for their conscientiousness about indicating which products are older models they have saved me a lot of aggravation in the past and i should have come here first and not bought from the other place
i almost always search amazon before buying anything and they have done well by mei bought this for when we go trail riding on our atvs
although i have used gps systems before i am new to the etrex
i rated it so low for a number of reasonsthe compass is useless unless you hold it at the exact required angle it will not read correctly
while this might work if you are hiking it is not going to work on an atvthe supplied map software is useless
i could not even find my own street
it lacks detail it lacks road names it lacks place names it is totally lacking and a waste of timethe gps itself is very sensitive to locationenvironment
it barely works on the second floor of our house
it barely works in our car
it works well when outside with a clear view of the skyi was unable to set any useable waypoints using the etrex itself but did manage to set a couple using the supplied softwarethe only function that i liked and that seemed to work well is the trip computeroverall very very disappointing considering garmins reputation
i will be returning it and will try something elseits very simple everything i have ever owned by simpletech has died on me including this sd card  usb sticks  hard drive and  cf card
not one of their products lasted me more than  years and caused me a lot of headacheim a gadget freak so i always have to have the latest of everything
and when i read about the ipaq i knew i had to have onehowever after lugging this thing around for a few weeks i just could not get used to the size
i always used to carry my palm v in the front pocket of my levis but you really cant do that with an ipaq the size is substantially biggeripaq is a real computer with a real operating system
but guess what i dont really need a real computer with me all the time
i also discontinued web access on my cell phone after trying it for a while but thats another story
im back to my palm v and very happy it is extremely fast and proficient at the stuff i do want with me my schedule and my contact list
and yeah palm is expandable too with tons of apps you can add to it if you wanti bought the ipaq  pocketpc as an upgrade over my sony clie palmos device but after a year or so the battery went kaput and it would have cost more to replace the battery than the device was worthwhat i liked compact flash jacket allows memory expansion higherresolution screen than my clie loud highquality speaker for the late s handwriting recognition was pretty coolwhat i didnt like without the cf jacket the device was too slippery to handle without dropping it windows pocket pc ui was very clumsy compared to palm os handwriting recognition wasnt as fast as palms graffiti handwriting recognition system battery died after about a year it woke up every night in the middle of the night horrible battery life had to charge it every day screen not as readable as sony clie in sunlightif i had to pick just one reason to sum up why i kept going back to my clie running palmos id have to say the user experience on the pocketpc was just plain awful
the poor battery life clumsy windows pocketpc ui and large size with the mandatory cf jacket made it a pain to lug around and use
i also tried using it as my mp player but that was a mistake because the device was pure evil and would wake up in the middle of the night and start playing whatever i was listening to prior to putting it down for the night
the first several times it happened it was really creepy because i would wake up hearing voices in my apartment in the middle of the nightupdate to my review below  i bought this zip drive a year ago and just recently got around to copying all my zip disk data to a different media flash drive
i copied about  zip disks and as i inserted the last disk to copy it started making a clicking noise and wouldnt read my disk
i did some research and found out that people call the clicking noise the click of death meaning the zip drive has broken
the good news is that unlike my experience below i was able to get my disk out of the drive
below is my review from over a year ago
i stand by it my statement to buy and use a different storage or backup media
like some of the other reviewers i bought the original mb zip drive in the late s which featured a serial port or parallel port not sure which one
it was awesomebut then a few years later i got a new computer that didnt have the port i needed to connect the device
iomega told me they didnt have or recommend any adapters and that id have to buy a new zip drive
so i purchased the iomega mb usb drivei didnt use it much at all
maybe  times
i got it out the other day to download some stored files and i got all sorts of errors
then the device wouldnt eject my disk
i looked on the iomega support site and followed their troubleshooting tips to no avail
the site said if none of the tips worked to call support
i did and since my unit was out of warranty i had to pay  to talk to someone
after getting connected they said that if their posted troubleshooting tips dont work for getting out disk the unit is broken
they said it was out of their scope and against company policy to tell me how take apart the unit to get my disk
so i asked you mean to tell me i paid  for you to tell me the device is broken and you wont tell me how to get the disk out
i was ticked
after i asked to speak to a supervisor my  was refunded to mei broke apart the device with a screwdriver not easy by the way to find that the ejection mechanism was made out of the flimsiest and most brittle plastic i have ever seen  like the mechanism was designed to break
which it had
plastic utensils are made better
i was able to get the disk out
hint the ejection mechanism is on the belly of the device and hardest to get to
anyway so now i have to order yet another zip drive so i can transfer all my data to another medium then i will kiss my zip drive goodbyewish they had written that in product description would have saved a lot of troublehad to return it and still dont have my photos from a few years ago off my zip discsi have been a longtime user of iomega zip drivesthe internal type
they have worked great and are convenient for quick access transfer and backup of daily computer files
i have some  zip disks filled with an assortment of important filessince my internal zip drive is on the same ribbon cable as my hard drive and i wanted to add another hard drive to my computer i had to give up the internal zip drive only two devices per ribbon cable
therefore i purchased the external iomega mb usb zip driveit is a plugandplay device so installation is instant
i put in my first disk and prestoit came alivewith a clunk a grind and an assortment of other strange noisesit started working
first tasktransfer about mb of info on to a disk
i waited and waited and waited some more
 minutes later it was finished
with the internal zip drive this task would have taken about  seconds
i could have gone out and washed the car during the time i waited
my computer has usb but the device is only a usb so that might have something to do with itnot only did this drive take forever to complete its task it was uncomfortably noisy
it makes all kinds of grinding noises sometimes slowing down to a crawl then speeding up again
my internal drive made a little noise but nothing like this
forget about doing anything else on your computer while the zip drive is chugging alongi cannot recommend this product at all
it is slow and noisy and leaves me the general feeling ofwell being ripped offbecause it is basically a cheap piece of junkat one time zip drives were the best way to archive files simply because there were no other convenient options available
but i think it is time to toss out all those old zip disks and go to usb flash drives for easily accessible backup and storage
for the big more permanent archiving i burn files to cds or dvds
for daily backups and quick access flash drives appear now to be the way to goiomega had better consider producing other storage products because if they keep making junk like this they wont be in business much longerthis product is horrendous
after a few months it would crash my disks and then the drive itself eventually died
zip disks as we all know are not inexpensive and the drive would continuously destroy them
this has cost me not only money but lost assignments and projects that were on the disfunctional disks
iomega replaced my disfunctional drive with another one which ended up conking out on me as welli use this drive also for my pc
i plugged it into my usb port then suddenly my computer wouldnt start
once i unplugged the zip drive the computer started working again
none of my other equipment that attaches to my usb ports does thishaving this drive has been one disaster after anotheri am an avid electronics fan but for some reason pdas were never on my radar
as a birthday present my mom gave me the m and after spending two days with it i was hooked
after two weeks however my m simply died
i never dropped it or anything
i had to do a hard reset to restart it and hotsync all the data
it lasted two days and then died again
so i once again performed a hard reset and while hotsyncing it died again and has refused to come back on
i know the batteries are not dead as i had monitored their level
so my opinion is that palm is crap
now that i a used to having a pda i am going to replace it with a sony clie pegsits funny reading the reviews below
like going through a time machine
steve jobs introduced the iphone and killed palm microsoft and sony
the iphone even the first generation did everything in a more user friendly manner
look at the reviews on these pdas
who needs color
 mb memory is more than enough  really funnypalm will soon discontinue this and continue to lower the price to free these from their inventory so if you are a pda user or already have one stop reading and find yourself a more worthy productthis is a quotpoor mansquot pda with all the basics and absolutely no frills
the screen is tiny by any comparison and the chunkyness of this device hurts it most of all
the reverse backlight is devastatingly hard to look at and strains your eyes terribly
basic models from sony today carry mb of ram and builtin expansion this has  with no expansion and quite possibly the worst screen ever manufactured for a mass produced handheldstay away i am glad i didhe descubierto con mucha satisfaccioacuten que este es un muy buen producto penseacute que tendriacutea algunos de los problemas que otras personas comentaban sin embargo para ser justo el dvd player ha tenido un buen desempentildeo considero que los problemas de saltos se dan por fallas en los discos pero no he tenido muchos problemas
presenta una muy buena imagen y una nitidez y fidelidad normalesi got this dvd player prior to xmas and soon discovered when i put in my first dvd that this dvd player has some serious latency problems
i dont know whats happening on the inside but every time i watch a dvd or listen to a cd it stops
then it makes a clicking noise like its trying to regain itself to continue then just freezes
im returning this thing tomorrowalso a friend of mine said his parents bought the same unit and had the same problemsthis item was such a huge disappointment
initially it worked well
but the more it was used we are only talking  rolls or so the more it started to deteriorate
first came the noises
then the grinding
then the failures to load film
forget trying to load the rolls of  pictures it would bring this thing to a grinding halt in many cases
this thing was only built to scan maybe  rolls tops
read the reviews on other websites
others have had the same thing happen
inevitable failure
and this is my second one both with the same result
for nikon to release such a poorly constructed product is surprising
especially since the scanner i have the coolscan v it goes in is actually a well built and excellent productbottom lineway too much money for a hunk of plastic with such poor construction
it will do the job if it is a small one to  rolls keep the number of rolls of  pictures to a minimum
be prepared to use that warranty and send it back to nikon at least once or twice
and wear a headset becuase that grinding squeaking noise as it rolls your film out is unbearablei only scanned about  rolls of aps before it gave up the ghost
luckily it has a  year warranty
i sent it off to nikon for repair
the scans were for the most part fine
oddly enough theyre always rotated wrong but thats easy enough to fix
preview takes too long so work off of your index printsthis looked like a good idea but in practice i find it doesnt work very well
the wheel doesnt grip the cord well enough to pull the cord back into the basket and i spend lots of time stuffing the cord back into the basket by hand
a plastic lever is provided to press the cord tightly against the rubber wheel but much of the time the wheel just spins and the only result is a black smudge on the orange cord
ive thrown the wonderwinder away and replaced it with a conventional handcranked reelthis is designed for a  light weight cord but i can not even imagine a person lazy enough not to hand wind thati bought it to wind and store  professional grade cords in my garage
the cheap plastic components could not lift the cord into the mesh basketso this is for grocery store  electrical cables but you have to drill the mounts into a solid wall with  screws
bizarrelike i said the concept is good but made way too cheap to be functionalthe description says holds  of  cord  of  cord or  of  cord but i couldnt get even the first few feet of a  cord loaded into it
the cord didnt naturally fall into a neat coil in the bottom and trying to guide it into place by reaching through the net was impossibly tedious
even if did persevere and get it loaded i wouldnt be willing to wrestle it back in every time i used the cord
that defeats the whole purpose of a reelthe cord im using is a very high quality very flexible silicone insulated outdoor cord thats almost impossible to kink
i laid it out straight in the sun before trying to reel it in as suggested by the instructions but it was still impossiblesince i dont have a  or  gauge cord i dont know how it would work with them
it must be great from all the favorable reviews
my cord may just be too flexible or rubbery for it
a cheaper stiffer cord might slip right in
it does seem to be sturdily made and a clever idea but i cant use itmust have had a defective unit but this thing fell to pieces when i tried to reel the cord in
i was too busy to deal with it so i never sent it back
i tried to fix it but couldnt
didnt work for me at allthey claim this will hold  feet of cord
not so unless its some small gauge
it wont hold even  feet of 
when i gave up on that and loaded  into it the basket came offi bought this headset thinking i would use it with voice recognition software on my mac powerbook
the fact that they fold up was a selling point because i thought they would fit well into my laptop bag  but the bing dongle thing which seems to contain the electronics is huge and intrusive and the cord it too long to be helpful
what makes it worse is that the audio quality of the stereo headphones is poor and the recording quality is also poor as it seems to skip over words or mangle parts of them  and i have an excellent speaking voice everybody always wants me to read aloud
and not to be nitpicky but they come in one of those hard clear plastic coffins that makes it almost impossible to get them out of the packaging without wrap rage
so i definitely dont recommend them
and now im looking for something better
maybe i will have to be stuck carrying one headset for voice recognition and another for music and dvds  ratsthe microphone is incredibly sensitive to electrical noise from laptop power supplies or powered usb hubs causing a very obtrusive hum when used with applications such as skype
as a result this plantronics model can be used on laptops only when running on battery power
since thats not practical i am now the proud owner of a stylish  paperweightit would have been easy for plantronics to include a lowfrequency rolloff around  hz which would filter out the hum but leave voice signals unchanged
unless youre singing a bass partits a pity really because otherwise the sound quality is quite goodpros nice headset neat folding designcons despite endorsement from scansoftnuance signaltonoise ratio was unacceptable when i tested it using dns software
if youre buying for voice recognition consider another productalso ran into usb conflict problemsyou can do better elsewherepros  sound quality is good as they saycons doesnt look so good
doesnt look neatnot comfortable to wearthe enhancer and the mic looks big as if this is a headset made in smoral  i am not at all satisfied with this product did not expect such one from my favourite brand plantronicsi am returning this back to amazoni was talking on ventrillo one day and all of a sudden the microphone just stopped working
i always take care of my equipment
i dont throw it down and i keep it away from heat
or magnetics
i cant explain it
when it worked it was great
i paid way too much for just  months of usage
i can not recommend this producti bought this headset primarily to use with skype but also for gaming when i did not want to disturb othersright away i noticed the sound quality was exceptionally poor but it did function so i just accepted its limitations
i rarely use the headsetyesterday i needed to place a skype call only to discover that the headset is dead
i have tried everything to get it working again including uninstalling and reinstalling the software and drivers
i even downloaded the latest drivers and software from the website but to no availit is dead
cheap and dead
i do not recommend buying this headset at all
even if you happen to get one that actually works the quality of the audio is awful anyway
steer clear of this onei had this headset working for only  day before the mic on it broke and wouldnt input any audio
this is the second plantronics headset that ive had that has broken quickly
i am not at all happy with thisi bought instead the logitech usb  model and although it seems to have worse reviews im quite happy with it
the audio quality seems comparable and more importantly its still working
the plantronics seems to me more fragile and prone to breakingfinally got to use this remote and it will not work at all
changed battery cleaned contacts nothing would resurrect this thing
what a waste of time and moneywould be nice if it worked
tried everything my pentax kx manual indicated that i should do and still no action
not impressed
perhaps a two pound masons hammer would do the tricki was disappointed with the short range of the remote not the  feet advertised but more like  feet
it comes with no instructionsi got one of those rare lemons so i cannot speak about the lens quality
despite having everything set correctly it would not give me an fstop reading and would not focus on af or mf on my pentax k
amazon was wonderful as always about a return and refund
i would not consider buying electronics and camera products from any other retailer
i love amazoncomi use this card in my canon d digital slr camera
after about  days it started to give errors when trying to preview my images
on some images it gave me card error message whereas on others it gave me image too large message even though i had viewed those images numerous times before and they were not large at alli bought this card because the tests on  had shown that this particular cf card performs best on abovementioned canon camerathis card worked fine for a while a couple of months in my minolta dimage  then for no apparent reason it would hold only a few more images than a sandisk  mb card i havelike half the other reviews ive read heremy viking md card died after only using it for  days
it gives me errors and im unable to retrieve pictures off of it
ive also reformatted it and it still wont let me retrieve pictures
i tried reformatting it in another camera and took a few test pictures and it still can not get the pictures off the cardsounds like viking is having a serious defect with this cardi thought a media card like this would be foolproof
no
i was on a hiking trip and took many pictures
all of a sudden my camera could not function properly
after thinking for a long time the camera showed cf read errori went home and plugged the card into the cf card reader
the light on the card reader was always on and windows could not read iti reached the conclusion that it must have died
it lost all my imagesi have owned  other cards with smaller capacity of course
none of them gives me any problem
i will never go for this brand againthis card worked great for about  or  months with no problems and i was very happy with it
then every so often it would either fail to save a picture correctly or pictures already on the card would get corrupted when new ones were taken
now when i use it about every rd or th shot is ruined
this is with a canon s
so im quite unhappy with it and am forced to buy a new card
i wish i had ponied up the dough for a better card in the first place
i will probably try a lexar or simpletechi bought this card to go with my nikon   it worked fine for about  months
now although i can continue to take photos i cant get them off the card my any means
pc cant read or even format the carddont waste your money hereas an update i went to the viking website and noted that they have a  year warranty
it was very easy to return and viking sent me a new one within a few weeks
so far so goodi ordered this item some time agowas chargesd for it and havenever received itthe player has been plagued with problems since about  months after purchasing
brand new dvds freeze up during playback and the system frequently will refuse to eject the dvds
stay away from this unit
the worst move panasonic has made is not providing adequate supportreplacements for these systems
any customer who has purchased one of these systems will most likely never buy a panasonic system again
stay away from this unitthe panasonic players work great when they work good picture most play dvdr discs well too the problem is the cheap spindle motors the one that spins the discthe ho error is the spindle motor not working panasonic has gone from a direct drive motor which has nothing to wear out in their early players to a cheap brush motor in the newer ones
dvds spin too fast for a brush motor the vibration from spinning the unbalanced discs gets dust from the magnets on the brushes and bearings causing premature failure panasonic should have known this
you can buy a new motor for about  if you are brave enough to try to replace it not a very easy task even if you do replace the motor it is still the same cheap brush motor subject to the same problems
be sure to buy a dvd player with a direct drive motor these arent the only players with spindle motor problemssave your money and buy a player that lasts more than  years
for me the money is issue but not as much as the hassle of getting a new player and installilng it and learning it and getting rid of the old one  waste at least half my day
panasonic used to make quality but now it seems you are just as good buying whatever they have at the supermarket checkout dvd player
panasonic trash
thats my rant
product gets  starsi bought an rvk on another online store and congradulated myself on purchasing such a wellreviewed dvd player so cheaply
i should have read the reviews here on amazon
while watching a special feature on behind enemy lines the dvd started skipping ie
the picture and soundtrack stuttered
i stopped the player brushed off the dvd and started it again
it wouldnt read and i got an h error code
it wouldnt read any other dvd either or cds
id chalk it up to individual bad luck if so many here hadnt reported the same problem
i just spent my money to watch  movies hurrahweve owned this unit for two years and it was a workhorse during that time
but like the other reviewers i bought this player to last much longer than two years
heck i have a boombox that is  years old and still plays tapes and radio just fine not to mention our yearold vcr which shows no signs of slowing down
oh and our yearold rca tv set still looks greatmy point here is that panasonic should offer some kind of refund to owners of this player
two years of life is ridiculous in this day and agei have had this item for more than a year
in that time i have become very friendly with tech support at my isp
the internets out again
no our linksys router has stopped working and needs to be reset again
unplug wait  seconds plug it back in
sometimes more than once a dayi did not try new firmware because people report all sorts of problems flashing the unit
and then no improvement on lost connections
if the firmware upgrade fails you can transform an unstable router into a hightech paperweight
in fact even patching windows xp tm to fix this loss of router connections does not help
yes microsoft has a hotfix for this
extemely frustratingdo not buy this at any price
your sanity is worth more than the savingsdo a web search on this model you will see that thousands of people have the same problems with the befwsi am trying the netgear wrg  v
it cannot be worse than this linksys routeri ended up returning this product
it never worked for long
a call to linksys got it working and it died after  minutes of surfing
the next day i got it running again and it died again after a slightly longer period
i gave up and went back to the wire
i hesitate to give a bad rating because with quotnewquot technology its hard to tell if theres something wrong with the product or my computer or my modem linksys also or my internet provider
however i took all the steps called my cable isp called linksys searched the knowledge database and it still wouldnt work
i cant wait until they work out the bugs and i can go wirelessi purchased this unit because i used to trust linksys products
i have a classic linksys routerport switch and it has been working great for the past year
thoughout the year ive upgraded the firmware on the router several times each time adding new functionality pppoe ipsec tunneling etc without introducing any problems
so i was really excited to see the apswitch because i thought i could just cascade the  devices together to serve my  computers at home  they look so neat stacked upso i thought
well before that point i have problem even getting my lucent orinoco silver card to stay connected to this ap
when i first power up the unit the ap would talk to the card for a brief period of time sometimes  minutes some times  but never longer than  minutes or so
i thoguht it may be interference so i tried a lucent orinoco rg ap and a dlink ap both of which connects multiple devices over multiple days
in addition i tried to use this ap for only hardwired connections turning off all wireless devices at home and over time  min or so the hardwired computer would lose its ip address over dhcp and i couldnt get a new one
because of this it tells me that its not a compatibility problem between lucent silver card and the linksys ap
moreover if i power off the unit for  minute and power it back on again it would work for another  minutes or so
its clearly brokenso now ive standardized on lucent orinoco wireless gears  silver cards  for laptops  for a ipaq   rg aps and life is wonderful
my advice  dont buy this unit until linksys fixes itfor some reason i cant get more than ten feet away without the unit without getting a warning that my network connections been lost
ive tried updating the firmware powercycling etc
nothing works
maybe this is an exception rather than the rule but their customer service is bad too
i tried everything they suggested and nothing worked
i wanted an exchange but i still have the old unitas other reviewers have pointed out this unit with firmware  will lock up every time you go to eg
msn and try to watch a video
the unit appears to be functioning the lights blink just as before but no data makes it to the pc and pointing a browser at the router or pinging it results in nothing but time outs
the only fix is to power cycle the unit reset button is ineffective and then the video will load and playas others have pointed out this has been known not to me until after i purchased the unit in the community for quite some time and linksys has not updated the firmware since what does that say about other products they sell
if they wont even admit that there is a problem what other bugs exist that you dont know are being caused by your linksys router and that they will not admit or fixthey dont even have the option of loading the older firmware in order to reenable the videobest of luck an exlinksys fanfirmware befws  filed bbb complaint  linksys sucksim done put a fork in me
i have been running the befws sucessfully for months on firmware version x which i downloaded from dslreportscom
i have started to use msn messenger to stay in touch with my the family and it is flaky at best because this old firmware does not contain the fixes i need
i contacted support today and was told i have tried everything sorry
well  linksys
i will never buy another linksys product as long as i live
i filed a complaint on the better business bureaus website and i encourage everyone to do the same
 let your complaints be heard
i am also considering a class action lawsuit against linksys anyone interested
here is my message from their helpdeskenriquez clarenz i think you already tried everything to make it work
enriquez clarenz im really sorry about thati bought two of these routers brand new and a family member bought one as well
all  of them are defective
if a computer on the network reboots the routers compeltely shut down
also many services like email would not work through the router
it makes little sense
but these routers are junk they simply wont work and i reccomend everyone avoid them at all costs
you might as well go buy a brick it will work just as well on your network
not at allworst purchase i ever made
i had used wireless before with webgear but thought a wireless router would be a good upgrade
setup was extremely easy but connection speed from  feet was so bad my connection kept timing out
i was running windows me and was not aware of any upgrade patch but for the money i said screw it and returned it for store credit
im running wire this weekend
stay away unless you get a cash back guaranteei bought this router and spent almost two hours online with linksys
after trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke english i finally understood that linksys has limited support for macs
when i asked what limited support means i was told we are not trained to help people with a mac
if you can borrow a windows pc we can help you
what a waste of time
i am sending the router back
beware if you have a macthis router is ok at bestprosinstallation with cable or dsl modem is really easy
setup in windows xp is almost automaticregular websurfing for wired computers works wellconsnote i am using a linksys wireless b usb enabled which connection appears to be strong  bars the router is located on the second floor but not more than  feet away though connection appears strong navigation is slow and lags
at time it does not even respond if you plan to do online games forget it
you will lag out constantly
i also reinstalled it several times opening different ports and nothing worked the lagging occurs even while wired to the router so it is not the wireless feature that has this problem if you are a webmaster and need to ftp to a server from your house forget it
this device wired or wireless only occasionally  of  times lets you ftp filesbasically for the most expensive b wireless router in the market this is not worth the price or the troublei find myself bringing the dsl modem downstairs whenever i need to ftp files to the server and sometimes during websurfing i get so annoyed at the constant hesitation that i bring it down again
defeating the purpose of having a wireless connection while leaving the other people without internet for the time i need to ftp filesi tried different ports and none gave me good resultsany suggestions are welcomedi work as a computer tech have always had good experience with linksys products bought this item without doing any research
soon after hooking it up i started experiencing the frequent disconnects others have been complaining about
please note that this only seems to be the case with the current sept  model listed as wireless b v
the item pictured on amazon is the older working model
the one you will get is a slimmer smaller nonworking version  i started searching the web for answers and found out that everyone with this version is having problems
please avoid this product until linksys gets this right
apparently they tried to cut costs on this model and made a major revision of the hardware well it doesnt work
i finally bought an older version on ebay and it worked right out of the box and it is still working not one disconnect
the version  i bought from amazon is going back to linksys hopefully i will get a fixed working one in return
this is a nonworkingh product i know what im doing and i couldnt keep it connected for more than an hour or two do not buy this product unless you need the extra aggrevation in your lifeupate october   it seems linksys has fixed the problems with this router the replacement router i received from linksys was the same model but it seems to work fine
we have also recommended this model to people at work for use at home with their broadband connections no one seems to be having problems now
my faith in linksys is restored
i cant change the star rating but i would give it  stars now if i couldif you use this router for heavy traffic it will disconnect you constantly both wired and wireless
the router also disconnects you every  hours
if you are using vonage utorrent windows media player streaming videos the router will freeze up constantly then you would have to power rest it
every random hour the internet would stop working them you would have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work again
one of the worst routers ever to buyif you run anything that needs a constant connection mirconline radioweb cams this router isnt it
linksys still hasnt done a thing about the streaming media bug
this is when you try to use a link that pops open the window media player which promptly crashes the router every time
the english as a second language guy in india thumbed his way through the manual and suggested all of the usual crapmtuetc  which of course was fruitless
i can crash it on demand every time
ive tried all of the firmware i can find and searched the forums to try and eliminate the issue without a solution
very frustrated
i guess its time to start over and get a pre n or wait for the standard to ratify
i also tried the voip unit for my callvantage phone
it was worse than this unitwent to the dlink unit
you get what you pay for
can you say belkin prenif anyone gets a fix for this id appreciate it if you send it my wayi have been using the linksys befsr dslcable router for  months and loved it
i purchased the befws to roam around the house using my dell laptop
i also looked at the wap
the price of the befws after  rebate and the wap was the same price on amazon so i decided to purchase the allinone befwsi should have paid closer attention to the negative reviews
this unit has caused me grief ever since i received it
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the latest version
configuration was easy
it did not take long to get connected to the internet through the rj ports but it was horrible ever since i got it connectedi successfully connected three computers two desktops and one laptop using the port router
i tried to connect wirelessly
after a lot of troubleshooting i finally did a soft reset hit the button on back of unit for  second
the wireless worked
i used the wireless in various parts of my house and was disappointed in the range
it only worked up to  feet away
the connection speed was good at fti then tried to connect to the internet using one of my other pcs connected through the hub nonwireless
it would not work
again i figured out the only way to get the pc to connect to the internet was to do another soft reset of the linksys
my pc got connected but the wireless would not work
i tried many different scenarios but the wireless would not work at the same time as my desktop pc
i wasted a lot of timei called linksys tech support and after i explained to him my experiences he asked me to do a couple things
the changes i made were all unsuccessful
he told me that i can ship the unit to linksys and they will ship me a new one
he explained the return process to me  i will receive an email within  business days to describe how i can return the unit i have to ship it back to linksys i am responsible for the shipping costs and they will send me a new unit
the entire process will take  business days
i was shocked
i had the unit for one day and i have to be without one for three weeks
on top of it i have to pay for the shippingi never did get an email from linksys and it has been  business days
i am sending it back to amazon  and will buy another brand
a friend really likes his dlink routerwireless unit
he also has much greater rangemy advice is to pay close attention to the reviews
i wish i would have
i could have saved myself many hours of frustationthis is a major piece of junk
i am in the process of trying to return mine
it crashes very often and typically ends up with a new ip address
one guaranteed way to crash it is to turn on port forwarding for something simple like ftp
did these people even test this thing
the range leaves something to be desired
upstairsdownstairs
you can forget it
about the only good thing is that when i first set it up they were very helpful the dhcp stuff didnt work as advertisedi wanted to hook up three computers in my house to the internet and i also wanted something wireless
after looking around and realizing that the only real choice is linksys and dlink i decided to go with the linksys i already had a d link b router and it kept disconnecting every  minutes
even with all the bad reviews on amazon i still decided to go ahead and purchase it and hope for the best
when i first received it it worked quite fine like for the first  hours
so i decided to upgrade the firmware
then after awhile more i started to have problems
my msn messenger would always disconnect the wireless signal only a few meters away would be very poor one day then great another the port forwarding wouldnt work like it should and then the router would completely disconnect from the internet about twice a day
the only way to correct it would be to unplug the router then plug it back in and it worked fine again
i used linksys online chat to contact tech support and they recommended flashing with an older firmware
so i did and well it still didnt work
so i just bought a basic  port switch and now everythings fine again
this couldve been a great product alot of features good price etc
but unfortunately it doesnt work well
and whats the use if it doesnt work
people say theyve had good experiences so its up to you whether to try it and see if it works or look elsewhere
after rebate it is quite cheap anyway so not much to loseid give this a  star only because it cant go any lowerbought this router about  months ago
first month or so worked great then i started to get dropped signals every few days or so and have had to unplugreplug the power cord just to get a signal again
then it gets worse and worse now i lose the signal daily and have to power cycle it at least once a day sometimes  or more
worse the signal comes in and out when it says connected on my computerbeen talking to tech support and customer service for the last  months
finally tech support told me that theyd replace my router for me at no cost to me and would even have someone pick up my old defective router so that i do not have to pay for the shipping of the old router back to them
in order to do so i had to call customer service for arrangements
to my surprise and my waste of time customer service coldly said that its company policy that i pay the shipping for the routersi agreed to settle the issue through replacement because i dont have to pay for the shipping and that since i will supposedly receive the new router first i will not have any down time not having a connection at home
this was agreed upon with tech support and customer service decides to change that
isnt there some sort of credibility with company promises and firstdecisionsi know its their company policy that i pay shipping to send my defective router back to them but since their techician told me otherwise should they not also honor the exceptionsigh i dont think i can take this any more
im going crazy
do not buy from linksys
they suck they really doi had used the wiredonly version of this box successfully for about two years
i thought id give this one a try
what a mistakeif you use cat wiring it works like a dreamif you use a wireless adapter forget itthere are several file not found errors in the webbased administration of the firmware
wireless clients show strong signal strength connecting to the box and indeed the boxs wireless lan link light is lit
however the box refused to provide dhcp service to any wireless clientsfor the record i was using a dlink dwl and a lucent orinoco gold on two different machines in my attempts to get an ip address
dlink and orinoco blamed linksys
linksys blamed dlink and orinoco
linksys is clearly at fault judging from the many message board postings that ive seen onlinethere are a bunch of wireless routers out there
save yourself the aggrivation of returning an item
i thought that by sticking with the linksys name id get a working piece of hardware
i was way wrongthis item was a big headache
i had big hopes for this linksys item but it let me down big time
it frequently terminated the internet connection
it seemd to be periodically automatically releasing and renewing the ip settings
couldnt stay connected to aol thru tcpip for more than a few minutes at a time without getting booted off
at least three times a day the internet connection would be completely dead and the router and cable modem would have to be powered down and powered back up to reestablish the internet connection
after reading many message boards and seeing lots of people had the same problem with linksys routers not just this model i sent this backi got a belkin fd wireless router as a replacement for about  bucks
its been working great with none of the problems i experienced with the linksys routermy advice is to go with the belkin router or try one of the netgear modelswhy are dozens of people selling this router on ebay for as little as 
it has serious flaws
dont use this router even if someone gives it to you for free
i bought it for my office a few years ago and attempted to use it as a wireless b router
it didnt work so i went out and bought a wireless g router and that was fine
i then brought it home and put it back in the box and forgot about it
recently i tried to use it at home as a wired router thinking that  since it was not being used as a wireless router it would work fine
it still had problems even with the newest firmware update
i soon discovered it wasnt the wireless feature that was the problem
it was the entire unit
it frequently loses the internet connection regardless of wired or wireless especially when streaming video
once you try streaming video which this router wont let you do you lose your connection and are forced to reset it over and over and over
very frustratingthere are posts all over the intenet about this unit but linksys has not done anything about the problemi have an easy fix for the problem
toss the produce in the garbage
see how easy that wasbought this router because most gave it a good review
however the router keeps locking up on me when i tried to transfer a large file from one computer to another computer
and the sad thing is that both of these computers are on the wired portion of the network
after trying various things i gave up and it is now a worthless paperweight
i called smc support about this and she said she will look into it and give me a call back
it is over a week now and i have yet to hear a call from thembasically i think smc has some serious quality control issues
i have also read on other sites that smc products have overheating issues thus the lock up
so buyer beware
i decided to purchase the us robotics mbps wireless router and this one never gave me a problem
it has a greater range the print server is much faster than the smc and the most important thing is it just worksi was lured away from the netgear wireless broadband router by this units lower price and additional features namely the builtin print server parallel port only
it was easy to configure and began working right away on my wired wireless home network
the performance was good for about  weeks
then one day the performance got worse and worse until it stopped responding to network traffic altogether
it wouldnt respond to pings even after leaving it powered down all night and resetting iti had read on other forums about problems with my particular version of this model 
apparently there is an older version  that doesnt have these problemswhen i contacted tech support which was responsive on a sunday morning and gave them my model number they knew what was coming
we didnt go very deep into troubleshooting beyond pinging  rebooting the pc
the rep acknowledged that the other version works better and is having one of those sent to me as a replacementupdate i received the older model and it did work better than the first unit
but sustaned transfers like a  megabyte download over the wireless lan would usually get stuck somewhere in the middle
the wireless link itself stayed up so i dont know if i can completely blame the router for this  maybe its a bug in windows tcpip stack or an incompatability with the linksys wpc pc card i use
but regardless ive never had this problem with my netgear router or public access points so ill stick with what works and this isnt itplug the power in nadda
no life
will see if the replacement fairs better and maybe the next review will improvethis router was quite easy to setup and works great for a single wireless or wired connection
but as soon as i get two computers on it and creating network traffic at the same time then i often get slowdown and soon afterwards a lockedup networkthis happens very quickly once i start using the laser printer i have connected to this smc routerprint serverits very frustrating
i should have kept my linksys router amp linksys print server combination of products  there were no problems
i could have added the wireless network router to my existing setupthere are dozens of storage albums for cds and dvds
this is one to avoid
it has just one fault and that is the zipper
the problem is closing the album
the zipper runs fine for about  
then it must make a sharp turn and there is nothing for you to hold onto to keep the zipper straight
this is where the zipper will fail and then it will not close at all
it opens fine has good storage but closing it is a real nuisancebuy something elsecase logic cases used to have ring binders
when you wanted to remove a page of discs you just popped it open and put it into another binder wherever you wanted
now with their ridiculous quicklock system or whatever the name is that some bozo in marketing made up if you want to move a page you have to remove all the pages that come before it
and these arent holes in the pages these are slits
its made organizing my collection a miserable activityand why did they make this change
because its undoubtedly cheaper to make a binding system out of plastic than it is out of metal
and by boasting about the new system they further insult our intelligence by pretending that its more desirable and functional than their previous system
its not
its better than a case in which you cant remove the pages at all but thats about it
case logic cases are otherwise well made but this one flawchange especially after theyd gotten us used to the threering binders is infuriatingi have bought  other  cases in the pastthey changed them and made them really cheapthe handle is badthe sewing is badand the change of designis very badcase logic has lost all my business from now onwaisted  dollars on this piece of junki will shop for a different brand and throw this one in back of a shelfas of may   the  cd version shows one look in the first and second photos while it is a different look  design in the third photo
i didnt think it can look different before ordering and i ordered according to the look of the first and second photoand the item arrived it is the one in the third photo i dont know whether the problem will be fixed later on i am going to return it and mention it to the customer service
hopefully it is fixed by the time you read this  commentat first i thought this was a good product
it felt sturdy and genuinely well made
after i started filling it up though i noticed that the movies that had been on the bottom row of the case for a while started getting scuff mark above the title
i looked at about  dvds on the bottom row and they all had the scuff marks
i didnt realize this little plastic edge from part of the holder on the top row sticks down and is pretty sharp
well it seems i found this out the hard way because now im not sure if i can watch the end of any of my movies
this is really irritating and i feel like they just cheaped out on the production line and didnt make the sleeves big enough
by this if product if you feel like doing precision surgery on every page to cut the little flap of destruction offunfortunately this product is being misrepresented in the pictures
i ordered the  capacity folder and it has neither the strap on the spine nor the plastic rings that the pages ride along
the flimsy pages are sewn directly in
the whole thing is very shabby and is very very light
i doubt it will last more than a few weeks unless you were to store it and never unzip it
im very disappointed in case logic for this terrible producti cannot specify the number of years of which i am speaking
most likely  no more than  at any ratei would have written perhaps did write reviews  speaking of the fine quality of the standard case logic cases for larger quantities of disks  and up
have filled at least a dozen of the  large ones
for various reasons i am now undertaking a large scale reduction in space use as somemany of you are or will by getting rid of the individual disc containers and putting the discs in wallet albums whatever they may be called by particular manufacturers
being satisfied with the old case logic i had i started to buy more of them untiluntil i began to remove all the cds from their case logic albums in order to download them into external drives and give them away as part of the space reduction process
now here is what i found with all these case logic albums
as i opened and flattened them out to remove the discs small bits of a hard black substance began to fall in quantities on the table i was using
examination revealed that each one of the cases were yielding more or less but invariably some quantity of this material
to cut to the chase the substance within the cover of the albums had disintegrated and was now being disinterred from openings in the linings or whatever and falling out or spreading within the  cases requiring removal
ok i could live with cleaning up the mess though it is the kind of thing that will get into carpets and discolor some of the lighter shades
problem  is it has already spread infiltrated mostly the outer first and last pages  of the albums in thereby of course it gets at the discs therein
how efficient my cleaning techniques have been in removing the detritus i cannot  be sure  of without playing the discs  something i have no  time to do right now 
will it happen to all models of case logic
i dont know
how much time does it take
i dont know
my response has been to keep the cds in stacks within the kind of holders in which the blank tapes come and to buy another brand of album to put the dvds which i am keeping for now  in storage
long term i will remove everything currently in the new case logics i had purchased before seeing the phenomenon i described
does it happen to other brand names
are the newer case logic different
i dont  know
for me as i have said it was a long term thing
i think it safest not to use case logic for anything new and to replace the case logic as my schedule allows
what do i recommend
that is up to you
i am just telling my own storyproduct received was not as advertised or as previously received on earlier orders
im trying to get all of my dvds sorted into a matching semipermanent filing system
the first few wallets were actually koskin as shown and noted in the advertising
the most recent order was the cheaper ballisticclothlike wallets
initially i thought i would prefer the ballistic clothlike wallets but i ordered and received the koskin units for ease of cleaning
true enough the ballisticcloth units repel my label adhesive and are murderous to clean with their thousands of little dust catching crevices
at the end of the day i receive a lesser cost and quality wallet for what was advertised as the koskin price
the spine straphandle on the ballistic cloth unit does look and feel more robust than the strap on my koskin unitsi own both the old version and this new version
the new one sucks plain and simple
fist of all it isnt made of leather like it says it is made of plastic that looks like leather
the construction is nowhere near the quality of the old version
the sides are made out of nylon and not cloth like the old version
the fabric that holds the disks is significanlty crappier and is so thin it is see through
even the zipper is crappier
nothing about is has been improved what so ever
everything has been made  cheaper and crappier
avoid at all cost
go with someone else
case logic has just lost a customer for lifeits true cl has improved this product
in the process they ruined it
for one thing they removed several features for instance the new version does not have the removable fast file and lacks the slot for a label on the handle
also it is about  lighter and obviously cheaper in many respects eg the sides are now lightweight nylon
i would be surprised if one of these new models holds up for even  as long as the old one
and its ugly brown stitching on black faux leather looks awfulthere is one actual improvement in the new one  it was easier to open flat on a table
and one possible improvement  the attachment of the handle is apparently different but you cant really tell if its any better because it is hidden on the new oneyou cant blame amazon  the new and the old one have the same upc code 
but they are different part numbers old    new  ai am disgusted with case logic for this crass and brazen attempt to squeeze a few pennies out of the production cost at the cost of huge loss of quality
im not going to touch any of their products again  imo they cannot be trustedthe outside is nice material but the sleeve inserts are cheap and flimsy and disks dent to slide out to easy
i actually just threw mine away due to to many disks getting scratched by the zipper while sliding out of the pocketssleevesi am actually quite angry for all of the reviews above one star on here
this product is so bad im tempted to throw it directly in the garbage can
i have old cases not case logic that are built solid with metal ring binders easy to open and close and look great
this case should be priced at  for those that was a piece of crap for cheap
this was shockingly poor quality
i will never buy a case logic product ever againafter charging the rio  and calibrating the battery an annoying  hour process i spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how to load songs on to it
this is mainly a fault of the instructions once you get the hang of it the software isnt that badthe product was great for about an hour
then it shut down for no apparent reason
even with the adapter plugged in it wont power up
trying to get through on their customer service line is next to impossible
this thing is a complete waste of moneyafter i returned it i bought an intel pocket concert
its a little more expensive and doesnt come with as many accessories but it has worked every time ive used it and im much happier with the purchasei bought this item like many of the others who tried to quotdodge the bullet of defectivenessquot
i brought this item home and discovered one important thing
the primary calibration of the battery does not fully calibrate properly the first timeyou must repeat the process and you will eventually get the full  hrsit played music after the rd calibration for a little over  hours straightnow the problems
i began getting blips in my sounds
before you begin judging my mp collection i am an audiophile
for heavens sake i even do a little bit of music recording
and were not talking small quiet blips here
loud blips that sound as if they would ruin my left speaker
these blips later on switched to the right ear and finally to both stereo blip
something is horribly wrong heresecondly whenever the backlight goes on when you push a button the unit emits a loud buzzing sound
considering the fact that it made no buzzing sound when i first got it for backlighti assume something in the circuitry is going to fail at some point
perhaps the blipsnow for the good
the screen is very readable and contrary to the reviewseverything fits in that small oval window
they designed it so that even though the display behind that circle is a rectanglethe text only appears where the oval opening is
it had great sound quality minus the blips at volumes  out of   the unit gets quite loudin conclusion if your going to attempt this productorder it with another set of headphones because the collapsing type are quite annoying and i hear from others that it doesnt fit everyones head
transfer speed is ok but i can burn a cd just as fast with no blips
ksec transfer speed i clocked it
this is a wonderful product design idea poorly implemented
i promptly returned minewhen i was in the market for a digital audio player the choice of a rio seemed logical enough
first to market wellknown name and i was unaware of any horror storiesindeed the rio  seemed to offer everything i wanted and more rechargeable batteries great backlit display simple menudriven interface logical controlseverything went great  at first
a full overnight calibrated charge cycle loaded some tunes the next morning and ventured out for a walk with it
not  minutes later the thing went deadi tested the battery with a meter  full charge
but the thing wouldnt come back on for anything
pluggedin the ac adapter and it came back to life  for about  seconds
that was enough it went back immediatelyno wonder theyre out of stock at every store in town and as of late december  out of stock here too  theyre all gone because people have been exchanging every other one as defective if the reviews here are to be believed that istruly this is literally the ideal mp player for my use if it only worked
and thanks to the reviews here i wont be trying another one or any other sonicblue product either for that matter
it would certainly appear that a more rigorous quality control program would do wonders for these folks
meanwhile i think ill try the intel pocket concerti just had a bad experience with a brand new rio  went back to the store in  hours
it seems there is a reason rio is trying to move them
their tech support lines seem to be jammed too
seems they have been knowingly shipping units with bad chargers that may permanently damage the unit and even my new charger doesnt workheres my disgruntled letter to rio supporti am returning my rio  player i bought yesterday for many reasonswhen i took it out of the case and read the charging directions there was a slip of paper saying that if the charger didnt look like the charger in the picture not to use the device until rio ships a new onefirst if there is someone taking the time to put the slip of paper in the case that person should instead be checking the power supplies and exchanging them in the box before shipping the product
if the new power supplies are not ready then you shouldnt be shipping units for christmas that cannot work without them until they are
i would have been infuriated if i had given this as a christmas gift and the recipient had to wait a week for a charger to play with it
why not just ship stockings with coal
qualitycontrol is a job your employees do at packing time not your customersluckily i had a charger that looked like one in the picture as best as i could figure
you dont specifically mention on the sheet what to look for to tell if you have a new charger and you dont provide a picture of the old charger for comparison
i assumed that since the small nub jutting out beside the jack was unique that that was what i was looking for so i went ahead and conditioned the unit per instructions because i had such a chargerwell within  minutes the charge light went out and the condition screen went off
you mention in the instructions to make sure the charge light stays on but provide no instructions on what to do if it goes off
since i could not get back into the menu i unplugged and replugged in the charger and went back into the conditioning menu and continued charging
in the morning the light was off and the unit had only  chargeso i called the technical support number on the package and this is where i ceased to become a rio customer
i had to navigate a long and borish ivr system riddled with tales of online customer support i think i have  completely different email addresses for your support including riohomecom diamondmmcom and sonicbluecom other products and even specific mentions of solutions for problems and products i did not have
when i finally got to the end i was told not only were the customer support reps busy but i would not even be put on hold
no queue times no hold music no nothing  just go awaycompanies have an obligation to customers to have a concise ivr system appropriately staffed lines and to allow a caller to remain on hold and be kept advised automatically of their place in queue and expected hold times
these ivr features have been around for a while
you sell a hardware product  if you arent going to help me fix a problem quickly over the phone back to the store it goes
i am not going to sit around and wait for email supportanyways back to the store one more lost christmas saleafter some research i determined that instead of pulling wires through the walls and playing around with things like that i was going to go the easy way
i found out about wireless networking
i looked into it and discovered that linksys had the fastest wireless capabilitiesthough it was nothing special it could go up to  mbs if the computers were within  feet of each other
further away and the service dramatically declined
but it was easy just install the software hook up the components and i was ready
or so i thought
this begins that drama play titled norwaynick vs the wireless network
i was very eager to get it home and set it up
i sat down in front of the computer and opened the packagesinside i found instructions and the products
first i read the instructions to set up the access point
the access point was what was supposed to send out the signals to the little stations which would be at every computer
from the beginning my experience was poor
the instructions were very difficult to follow despite the fact i know quite a bit about computerswhen i did get the access point installed and hooked up i went on to the little stations or wireless usb network adapters
i had to install all of these which were also difficult to follow and then plug them infinally a few hours later everything was done or so i thought
i went to try it out on the computer that powered the access point first
success
it worked and the speed was just as usual although here the access point and station were just a foot apart but it made me very hopefulon to the next station
i went to my next computer
no signal
the signal was not being received and when it was it was only 
it needed atleast  to work properly
the same thing followed on all the rest
i was so unhappy
all of the computers were easily within  feet of the access point and according to the box the signal could stretch to  feet
so what was the problemi went back to the one that did work and after a little inspection i uncovered an very disappointing fact
the wireless was not working there
instead the cable wire was going from the cable modem into the access point and then to the computer by the usb wire that was supposed to configure the access point to that computer
if i unplugged the usb network adapter or the little station everything still worked fine because i was sending it to the computer via wire
moral of the story
dont go wireless with networking yet
everything else might be wireless but this just isnt dependable
i would never recommend using this to anyone so save yourself the hours and money and either put in the ethernet wires or hire someone to do itps now i have the house wired with ethernet cablesthis product will work with windows  however much tweaking is needed and many hours on tech support
one thing i will say is this  adapter randomly decideds which xp computers it wants to work on
i have it configured corectly but why make a product that goes against windows thats made for windows
if you ask me you should have to configure it to work against windows not the other way aroundi bought this usb adapter to connect a second tivo to my home network
tivo is very fussy and requires the  version of the wusb
the amazoncom picture appears to be the ver  adapter but the adapter i received has different markings
my old wusb has the version on the outside of the box but this one did not
i called linksys and they couldnt determine the version number
they guessed it was  so i disconnected my old wusb from my networked tivo and connected the new adapter
it was not recognized
i rebooted no better
i reconnected the old wusb the one from the box marked ver  and it worked immediately
i suspect that amazon now has a different version 
 and it tivo does not like it
if you are buying a wusb adapter for your tivo make sure it is ver  or it probably wont workhad several years ago and fought with it for a long time
nd floor router on first
belkinnrt and netgear wg both connect with strong signalthis thing would barely connect at all and constantly drop connections in xpusing linksys router
admittedly outdated but should be able to manage some sort of connection
linux a total no go with this
sorryi have this unit working with windows xp and the linksys befws wireless hub
the wusb is a power hog so it wont work with passive usb hubs
it wasnt easy configuring the unit with wep and i never really figured out what the problem was
the tech support from linksys has been absolutely horrendous
in the end my unit decided to die and now i have to send it back to linksys to get a new one
if you have a laptop go for a more reliable wireless pc card solution i recommend the orinoco gold from lucent
not recommendednot a good product used it for a year only get  bars end up i bought the alfa awush
i got  barsthis does not support wpa which is much more secure than wep
this would not be a good idea for any modern home network because wep is too easy to hackword of caution about toshiba quality  i have a toshiba sd dualdisk dvd player bought new mid
used it for  month then it sat for  months in a closet unused while i was on an assignment
when i got back i got  more months of use  then it quit reading disks repairman says the laser pickup failed
of course now warranty is long gone even with extended warranty due to purchase with visa card  still have to pay  for labor parts are another  that visa will pay
rather disappointed unit only provided  months use
reading other reviews at various online sites other owners have also complained about toshiba quality
now looking for my next dvd player ill keep looking excluding toshiba
if you do buy get an extended warrantyi grant this dvd player does have a good picture
but it has a few problems with freezing and sticking video picutures
glinches in it plays a dvd
or not even able to read the dvd it self
i blamed it on the dvds them self
but it turned out to be the dvd player
i also have problems with it not playing dvd
i put the dvds in this toshiba and they would not play
i took them to my neighbors and put the same dvd in their dvd player and they played
i would think twice on buying this dvd player again
i cannot even rate it for the problems it has casued
also the dvd player is under a class action suit becasue of these reasonsthis unit worked for about nine months then just stopped
no sound and no led front panel displays  just total silent
i thought that like most electronics devices once it got over its teething period it should be ok for awhile
but not this toshiba
i just hate to put it in the trash bin but this will be the case since it is not worth to repair
really a wastei bought twoone for my bedroom and one for my classroom
i like the zoom features on the toshiba as well as the ability to speed up choose whether you want to see the dvd in widescreen or regular format if the dvd supports it and the remote control is very thorough
you can also set what type of sound you want and i dont mean languages as well as the picture mode animation movie etc
the one complaint i have is i cant save a spot in the memory unless the movie is not playingim editing my rating
one of the two has quit working
the sound ceased to work on the one at work
for no reason
right now its a very big paperweight
avoid toshiba
the other one seems ok but for it to die in the amount of time it did that makes me one very unhappy camper
go for another brand and save your moneyyet another editthe second one has bit the dust too
and ironically the sound was the primary problem
i like toshiba but i had two die and a friend had one die
maybe they just arent meant to make good dvd playerslooking for some cheap electronic organizers i came across this one
the floor model was on sale so it made it a great deal
the software was not included and i wasnt told that i needed software to make it work with my computer
the sales associate made it sound as the palm would install the needed components on my computer
no where on the box did it mention a cdrom to installwith this lack of software this thing is pretty much uselessi bought this to replace my palm tx which will not work on windows  i can not synchronize that palm with my desktop using windows  i do not seem to be able to use the palmone m by itself or synchronize it with my computer so it is gathering dust in a draweri owned a terrific palm v which i dropped and destroyed by accident
then i bought an m
what a mistake
it has been nothing but problemsi had the same problems as everybody else with the usb cradle not hotsynching
i tried resetting the handheld several times and eventually it came back on
but what a royal pain
also the battery has been a problem too
for two weeks i couldnt get a charge to hold
again hard resetting it over an over helpedthis device cost far too much to behave this way
tech support was limited and not helpful
i wont buy another palm deviceas for me that was wasting of money i used this once communicating with the pc is a pain using that is very uncomfortable any smart phone with scheduling application can do way more and is way easier to use that would be maybe a good thing but  years agothe supplier of this products tells me that this is an old ad above
that it no longer comes with a hotsync cradle and you cant use it with  bit vista
that none of the palm products will work with  vista if you have to use the connection cord so i had to send mine back although the supplier said he would credit my account thro amazon i am still out the postal fees both waysi think most of those who have given this palm a one star or who wish to give it a negative star have summed it up correctly
the palm does not consistently sync
after  year of use mine was dead as a doornail unless it was attached to the charger
hence ive not used it in a whiledoes that mean its time to spend  on a battery
is it really worth it
not
mines in mint condition and ill take what i can get for it on ebay
time for a reliable pdai owned a palm in the past and bought this because the old one died
this one is a newer model and not as good as the older model
plus they have no way to light up the background so that you can see the display at night
thats a basic function that should have been included for the price
i do not recommend this and will never purchase a palm againone other reviewer on this site mentioned an ongoing problem with the hotsync cradle on this model
the cradle is not the problemits the palm device itself
when working properly the  series palms are great little handhelds
the manufacturer has an ongoing quality control issue with units that fail to hotsync after anywhere from a few days to several months of use
in my particular case it stopped working three days after i received it as a christmas gift from my wifeive been to a number of forums where this problem has been discussed in detail
in some cases the hotsync failure has been attributed to software problems but in the vast majority of cases an internal defect in the handheld has turned out to be the culprit
palms quotfixquot for this problem is to send the consumer an quotenhancedquot model which in reality appears to be a factory refurbished unit
although the company ships it at no cost to the consumer the consumer is expected to bear the cost of returning the defective unit to palmalthough other owners have knocked palms customer support service i can honestly say that my dealings with them have been quite good
these people are not to blame theyre only doing what their supervisors tell them to do
the fault here lies with a company that produced a defective product and is trying to get out of its responsibilities as cheaply as possible
i sold my sony clie pegs when my wife bought me the m now i truly regret doing soi have been a loyal palm user since the very first pilot came out
when i replaced my plam vx with the  i was shocked at the difficulties with the usb hotsync
granted i use lotus notes v with intellisync but no matter what i do including using the quotdevelopers back doorquot the usb timesout during true synchronization
that means that i can only sync from the pc to the   not vice versa
palm at first refused to acknowledge the problem but now no longer refuses to admit it
but still no fix
this is way too much money to spend to have buggy softwarehardware
either wait until it works right or get a sony
the handspring visor is nice but extremely bulkyi am the palm specialist for a large hospital
when the palm m first came out one of our mds bought one
from the getgo it had hardware problems and in the end we warrantyreplaced it four times for different hardware problems a bad screen a bad power button no hotsyncing through the cradle etc
since then two other mds got ms and both of them have had the hardware go bad hotsync hardware problems both times and they recently got warranty replacements
palm desktop  was used in each case which had a fix for m usb syncing but that did not help our situation
we now have a policy that palm ms and ms are discouraged
there is an m that has given us glitches with hotsyncing upon occasion although it has not completely died yet
i recommend the sony clie t for the color palm os optionunless you have near perfect vision without glasses or are considering these binoculars for a child do not buy them
for looking at scenery in the distance they are fine
move in to fairly large signs at perhaps  yards like on the golf course in my back yard and you will likely not be able to read them
i couldnt with these binoculars even though i can read the signs with a pair of x wide angle binoculars that i purchased at a yard sale many years ago
move in to a tree or bush to look at a bird from  feet and you will be extremely disappointed
the image is very blurry
i just had a lengthy conversation with a rep from bushnell and that individual confirmed everything that i have said
if you have corrected vision or need correction these binoculars are not for youthe bushnell permafocus xs do not show as much detail as a pair of x binoculars for objects less than  yards away because the xs are not in good focus at  yards and uselss at less than  yards
bushnell deserves a booohisss for hiding this information from customers
the minimum usable distance probably varies with the ability of the users eye to focus this decreases with age but mine are probably about average
also the inside instructions indicate permafocus binocs are good at less than  ft depending on the model
this is not true for the xs
most inexpensive xs will give a better view at  feet and lessbut if objects are over  yards the xs are in focus and flawless as far as i can tell
i can easily recognize people at  yards
i can read license plates at  yards it helps if the binoculars are resting on something to prevent vibrationwithout a support  theres probably too much shaking for x binocs to do much better than xsthe eyepiece rubber does not stay rolled back if you try to use them with glasses for more than  second so you cant wear glasses while using them but as with other binoculars you do not need to wear your glasses
i dont know the science behind it but whether or not you wear glasses does not seem to make a difference with the permafocus
the rubber around the eyepieces cannot be removed unless its cutin summary the normal bushnell xs are probably much better than the bushnell permafocus xs because they can be used at much shorter distances and focusing on objects greater than  yards should not be too much of a pain
these xs are no good unless your typical viewing distance is greater than  yards and you dont plan to use them on less than about  yards
im returning them due to manufacturers defectbut concerning the permafocus idea i love my old pair of total focus xs for birdwatching and carrying in the car
being free of focus is a different experience almost as big as going from monocular to binocular
but you need a pair that can focus down to  yardsi dont know maybe i got a lemon
i bought this things as a christmas gift for my family
i hooked it up and it worked
two days before christmas it dies
the power wont even turn on
its now too close to christmas to get an exchange so its off to best buy to get purchase a different dvd player to replace the toshiba  that i am returningadd me to the list of poor people who owned this product for less than  years but just long enough for the warranty to run out before expiriencing a complete breakdown
while watching a typical nothrills dvd i was suddenly left with no sound
imagine my joy
choose another unit unless you plan on upgrading within the year lifecycle that many of us have already discovereddont waste your money on this sorry excuse for a dvd player
it would not play any of my dvds
i own over  dvds and tried  of them and none would play
unfortunately i threw away the original packageing so i was unable to return it for a refund and now own a  doorstop
stay away from all toshiba dvd players
i rated this player with one star because i couldnt give it a zero starthis product has excellent features but my unit will not finalize most discs after recording
most of the popular blank audio cdr discs such as maxell memorex fuji verbatim etc
are not compatable with this machine
however it will usually function with tdk discsi contacted phillips about repairs unit is still under warrenty
if you buy this machine be very careful to quickly and thoughly test its operation using several varieties of blank audio cdrsi have experienced nothing but frustration and disappointment with this equipment
it has been a problem from day one and is not very intutitive to use either
i will be packing it up and returning it for repair this week after only having it for  months plus i have used it very little
it now will not open the cdr tray no matter what i do
when playing it in shuffle mode with  cds in tray it stops after about  minutes of music and i have to unplug it to get it to reset and do anything
when inserting a cd in tray to play it will not read the cd until i press play a couple of times and reopen and close the tray a couple of times
previously i had a sony  tray cd changer for  years and never had one problem
too much technology for a cd player recorderi have this same model but without the mp addition
trust me no mp feature of any kind will make this cd recorder worth the purchase
i had mine for only a few months before it simply stopped recording on cdrs id been using all along
so it had to be shipped back to the factory where it stayed for  weeks so they could look at it
over a month later i got a call from them saying that philips cd recorders are only designed to work with philips exclusive cdr blank media
my first problem with this is that apparently nobody who sells philips recorders knows thisor they just dont tell you and philips consumer electronics themselves dont tell you in the instructions on the box or even at their helpline  number
secondly good luck trying to find any philips brand cdr blank media out there much less at a reasonable price
and even when the unit is functioning the way it should the recordtimes are sporadic and the computer inside the unit is fickle at best
please use my unfortunate experiences with philips cd recorders for your own benefit
do not spend your hardearned money on this product
im sure there are other quality cd recorders out there but i just blew my money on the wrong onei initially liked this product very well
ive had it since early january and now i wish i had never bought it
if there is another manufacturer of a similar producti wish i had bought from it instead
first my screen has gone completely dark in just  months of use which means that i have a malfunctioning frame you have to use ceivas site to substantially adjust your image
you cant just upload it from your graphics program like photoshop or psp into your frame or the image will look all washed out
this is despite your images looking just great in those other programs
i dont appreciate having to do multiple image edits
using photoshop or psp should be enough
besides ceivas directions on using its site are poor too and if you are low tech you are going to have a big big problem figuring them out
next you have to pay for an online subscription to use its site in order to load your frame in addition to your purchase price  i should have followed my own advice
since i didnt i urge you to do so and avoid having a dead loss on your handswe got a ceiva for our kids grandmother concept was great but the unit died two times and it takes weeks to get it repaired
due to her age she was not tech savvy so had to have someone else come over to work on it pack and ship reinstall etc
disappointing but was the only long distance photo option i could find  will be looking for a more reliable optionhhi have a frame that i bought for my grandmother but due to where she lives it was very difficult to get the frame to connect on a daily basis without resorting to toll calls
i have repeatedly tried to get them to stop renewing my account with out any success
my final solution was to call the credit card company and block any future chargesgreat idea 
lousy execution 
bought the unit tried to register couldnt because of duplicate serial number
waited until monday no weekend tech support called waited  minutes they send another
doesnt work have to wait until mondayagainwhen the get the bugs worked out it will be a great idea its a great concept if customer support was responsiveas of the last two weeks of december  it is notunable to get through voicecall customer supportthe web site is slow and loops me around endlesslywhen i attempt to purchase a subscription
too badi love my tungsten but i hate this charger
the connections are really flimsy
i have to wiggle it just right for the charger to actually charge
also the charge indicator becomes very inaccurate when using this device
it says fully charged in the morning and by the afternoon the battery is less than  charged
i have to contact palm about the warrantyupdate works perfect and set it up to use home network to stream video over it use lan messenger to talk all over the place
just dont use port  lol
seemed port  was acting like a server no matter what once removed we have port  using net at the same time no issues at allcame with bad ethernet cable no instructions or instal disc
i was glad they didnt change the setup password once i found the set up online
it never worked
tried running laptop and ps at same time
neither would connect but tried to connect to each other
but if ps was not connected i could only get laptop to connect and was very slow
 was still too much to waste on nothingit would be nice since this item is billed as somewhat different from the others to have a picture of the clip on the back so i could know what im getting before i buy iti was very disappointed in the case
it is small and the pockets are too small
business cards fit in the clear pocket but try and get them out
not very functional
the palm fits in akwardly and syncking it in in the case it is too hard to take it out is toughi planned to buy this product but needed some extra presales info from netgear a usb vs pcmcia card recommendation
i contacted their presalesdepartment which is part of their outofusa overseas postsales tech support operation
after waiting  minutes in the phone queue onhold i wasdisconnected
i called again and was told i would have to wait again in the phone queue which i declined
i instead faxed  top corporate officers with my helprequest but never received a callback or other reply
i can only imagine the tech support i might have received if i had a faulty product or if i need postsalessupport
based on this unusually poor support experience i instead purchased n station wireless lan from asante which offers excellent presales supportworked fine for about  months then broken
customer service is crappy
i had to throw it away and buy a new one nowwhats up with this
this is the wrong cord for the c  i returned it and got a refund amazons service is great as usual
so come on fix thisi have no idea why amazon recommends this for the c gps as it doesnt fit that model
i ordered it on amazons recommendation and decided it is too much trouble to send it back
they need to check out what works with what
be careful what they add as accessories as they may not work with the model you orderthis was my first experience with a megachanger
though my son found it relatively easy to program i couldnt see the markings well enough to do so
and after about a month it began to skip
first i thought it was dust or user error
then it started to skip more often
after another month it would play the first cd then skip skip skip
i took it to an authorized jvc repair place in november and its been there ever since
quotit has problemsquot to quote the repair personi purchased this cd player to go with my jvc stereo receiver and cassette tape player
it worked for perhaps a week and then one day out of the blue it began to skip while playing cds
i thought it might be the cd being scratched or dirty but it would skip on brand new cds too
the skipping actually playing just bits of tracks before moving on to another track continued all day long
no matter what i did the problem continued
the next day the unit worked fine again at least for awhile and then it started skipping again intermittently
it got so unreliable that i finally sent it back under warranty to jvc
they supposedly fixed it and sent it back to me with no description of what was done
i used the player several times before the skipping problem began again
i sent the unit back to the factory and they sent it back to me telling me that it was no longer under warranty
i tried calling jvc headquaters and left messages for them to call but never got a call back
i finally gave up on all jvc products
therefore i cannot recommend this product to anyone
it is just too unreliable and the customer service is terrible
i would not even give this cd player one star but that is the least amount of rating i can give itthis device  was the prime music source for a tv station in a mobile home community
it operated for a period of time and then started to have problems
it was repaired once but was taken out of use when it stopped and we were unable to open it and remove the discsjust like all the other reviews it started skipping like crazy after  week
sometimes it would work fine and then it would go crazy and start skipping like it was in fast forward mode or something
it even skipped on brand new cds
i am in the process of returning this junk to amazon
i think ill get a pioneer cd changer instead they are supposed to be the best
do yourself a favor and dont buy this piece of junk
im very dissapointed in jvcyep ive always been a pioneer person
from automobile decks to home components
thats why i went with pioner for a dvd playerthe st thing that happened is it stopped playing burned or store bought music cds
i put a disc in and a grinding noise would happen then it shot the tray back out
ok
ive got another cd player i can live with it for the time being
now the next problem is when sometime in a dvd movie a loud pop would happen through the surround system and the screen would go digitized into the little squares that make up the signal
it did this  out of the last  movies
i thought it may have been from used rental dvds but then it did it on a brand new one
thas when i took it into the shop
fortunately pioneer supplied a  yr parts and labor warranty
its in the shop right now with a  week turn around
it hasnt soured me from buying more pioneer products in the future but the next few months until the warranty runs out will tell the tale
good luck with yoursits too much work
you put the disc on the wheel put the wheel in the thing then plug the thing in then press the button then sit there for  minutes while the the wheel slow moves around
then you take out the cd then you polish it with the little square piece gimme a breakwe purchased one of these to repaid cds at our company
it didnt fill in any of the scratches whatsoever
we tried to fix the cd twice and it had no improvementi bought the motorized version of this product
i thought it would be a great way to take out some minor defects in some of my dvds
after trying to fix  with only minor problems i have decided to cut my losses
i did both of them exactly by the instructions provided
i even read the german and spanish instructions to make sure there wasnt a misprint
they said the same thing
i am a soldier used to following complex instructions to the letter and know that i did not make a mistake reading this in any of my  languagesi now have two dvds that will not load on either of my dvd players
this product is junk
it does not work
the only thing i found it useful for was the stress relief i got from smashing it on the floor several times
do not buy this product
hopefully i can get the dvds resurfaced at the local rental placelearn from others misfortune and do not get this dudit ruined  of my cds
it has this white circle thing on the cd that will not come off
i went to my local music store and they said the skipdoctor took plastic off of the cd itself
though i bought it at best buy which of course they basically dont return anything
bad
just go to your dollar store a few blocks down and get bathroom disinfecting wipes
they will give more satisfaction than this cd ruiner willthis gadget did not fix a single cd game that i have tried repairing it with
i ended up with a useless gadget that was no longer useable as the sanding wheel finally wore out
the replacement wheel itself cost a third of the actual machine
i wasnt about to waste more money on this useless piece of junk
i have read the directions and used the product properly
theoretically this product should work but in practice it really does not
it may work with very slight scratches in some cases but in my experience it did not even repair the minor scratches
do yourself a favor and just purchase a new disc and save yourself the headache time it takes quite a bit of time and money
i learned the hard way and hope that others will learn from my mistakethese speakers initially sounded just great for the price
i was pretty happy with the purchase and had no complaints
unfortunately after about a week i noticed crackle noises and assumed the speakers where blown and shut them off
but the next time i turned my computer on the speakers where fine
i assumed the reason for the crackle sound was a bad audio file
but eventually i noticed that it happens after the speakers have been turned on for around an hour or lessi read a similar review but ignored it because the overall rating is good
i hope this doesnt happen to you if you decide to order because the noise in unacceptable
its not a small crackle or error in pitch
when it starts its completely unbearable
so my only advice is to be sure you buy from a reputable source like an amazon or an amazon fulfilled seller
that way if a return is necessary and you are within the allowed time you can get a return or refund without a disputebut to some things up one star is a fair and accurate review in my experience
because if this is rare then the overall rating will be positive and accuratenot sure how this got  stars from the other ratersi bought a set a few days ago for  and i think ill have to throw it outthe  hz hum makes it sound like theres a motor big enough to lift an elevator in the room
its hard to hear the music over the noisei sent customer support a note but no replypurchased these from amazon a few months ago
terrible bass
overallit was just lousy from the satellites to the woofer
we threw them outand replaced them with an old pair of cambridge speakers sound worksnever will purchase them again
waste of moneydanxothe sound quality out of these is terrible
the subwoofer is really a cheap speaker about  inches across in a ported box
there is nothing over the speaker to protect it and you have to pretty much turn the bass on your computer to nothing to keep it from blowingill also add that the person that designed these felt it necessary to put a blinding blue led next the the power button so when you are working on your computer and if your like me you have these speakers near your monitor the blue led will be shining right in your face
i had to put a piece of utility tape over the led to keep from burning out my retinatrust me spend a little more and go with an altec lansing speaker set
i only replaced mine because after  years of service one of the speakers finally started going out
i will most likely order another speaker set and use this crummy one on another computer i dont use muchitem worked great for a about two weeks
given i knew it was going to have interfearnce problems with cell phones but ive had it for less than a month and now there is a constant humming noise that it emits whenever i turn it on
not a very good item
sound was great when i got it but it just did not last
buy at your own risk
i guess some people have better luck with ithave an older model casio keyboard and went to the website to see what adapter i should buy  this is what was recommended but ti does not work
waste of money and disappointed in the casino websiteok so it fits as advertised
i did not appreciate the fact that to make it work safely i had to wrap a bare wire with electrician tape
that is really below expectationsthe problem with all of these great reviews is that they were probably written soon after purchasing this remote
ill agree that at first i was very happy with the learning capabilities and use of this remote and its the only remote i had to have on my coffee table
then after about  months i noticed some frequently used keys volume channel pause stop had to be pressed harder and harder to get them to work
eventually after about a month of this those keys stopped responding at all
someone else noted the same problem in another review here
i returned it i had an extended warranty on it which i purchased from the store and they gave me a brand new one
lo and behold after  or  months the exact same thing happened and by  months the same keys stopped responding again
by now my extended warranty had expired so i was forced to reprogram common functions to other keys
ie
volume became buttons   pause was  channel up and down arrow up and down etc
one by one all of these keys ended up not responding as well until finally i was down to about  keys on the entire remote which would respond at all
all this after only  years
its as if i went through  remotes with all the programming over and over and now i again  have  remotes on my coffee table
piece o junki bought this sony remote in july   it worked just fine with my quot panasonic tv
recently it started losing channel updown function and today this went completely replaced batteries tried reprogrammingunsuccessful
pip functions and everything else still work
i am very disappointed in this productfor  and being sony you expect reliabilitythe only replacement universal remote i can recommend is the home theater master mx which ive had for  years now
it has worked flawlesslyof course it costs  or more
just what is the problem with remote reliabilityi threw these headphones away and bought the bose noisecancelling headphonesafter straining to hear my dvd player on my third plane trip i finally got fed up with them
they where not quotnoisecancellingquot and sounded thin tinny and weaki wish i hadnt wasted money on these but am very happy with the much betterquality and more expensive bosethis vcr is absolutely terrible
i can hardly distinguish between shows recorded in the sp mode from the ep mode
they just look bad
another annoying thing is with prerecorded tapes
the auto tracking does not pick up the hifi track
i always have to adjust the vcr manually to get the hifi stereo track
this is very annoying
who cares that it rewinds pretty fast
the picture stinks and i always have to get up and adjust the tracking
what is going on with sony
they used to make some of the best vcrs
im sorry but this vcr is junkive had mine for about  months and now the picture jumps as it seems the tape is dragging
i took out a tape and looked at it and its been creased on the bottom
not very good quality and its ruined a few of my tapes
i say stay awaywent for cheap and bought a repurposed unit  you get what you pay for  all of the cds skip no matter what position they are placed in the carousel which makes this cd player worthless  the next cd player will be new out of the boxi bought this junk not from amazon
it plays what it wants it is clunky like something from a nightmare called  track players what is wrong with sony
i recall when you could put a vinyl record on a turntable you got instant music
i recall that even  track players gave instant music so did cassette decks
this thing is garbage it doesnt work it will play about  songs then just sit there
dont buy this its junki tried to install one of these for a friend with a technics receiver and the thing just did not work
customer support claimed that i needed an optical cable and that actually did worst
i am not sure if the unit was bad or if there is a compatibility issue but what i do know is that there is no power button on the remote
we could not understand that how inconvenient
i am sure you would be better served buying a dvdcd changer for a similar price
atleast that was the advice i gave my friendupdate  the problem was the receiver so the cd player may actually be ok  i am still quite disappointed with the remote
from looking at the other reviews i would still pass it by and i am still leaving it at  star due to the remotestarted skipping before the first piece was half over
isnt there a good changer out there somewherealso had it playing through the aux of a single play denon book shelf system
sound was notably degraded from a cd played directly though the denon
fuzzythey were trying to grill me on an email asking for receipts etc  whatever man
ive banned everything memorex from my house because of thiscaveat emptor
the quality control at the memorex cdrw disc plant is sorely lacking
only two out of the ten discs in the pack even worked straight from the box
the other  lack the necessary absorption properties to send them on their way to being coasters
you too will pay too much for jewel cases should you purchase this doa discsthese discs do not work with iomega preadator drive
also my friends who have other brands of drives are also having problemsi recommend tdk and imationi recently installed easy cd creator  and attempted to format several brand new memorex cdrw discs
all attempts on two different pcs with different burners both with ecdc failed so it had to be either the software or the discs
i tried with a new sony cdrw disc and everything formatting burning went smoothly
i am convinced memorex cdrw discs are fatally flawedthese batteries are the sole reason i will never buy another canon camera
i love my camera but these batteries are overpriced and have a short lifespan
ive been through four of these in the last couple of years and part of the reason why is because theyre lithium ion
for the longest life lithium ion batteries need to be topped off as often as possible and should never be allowed to discharge completely every deep discharge cycle lowers the life of the battery considerably and after  cycles the average liion is at  of original capacity
so generally speaking lithium ion is a lousy choice for a camera
who takes ten shots and then tops off the battery
nicad is a far better choice for a camera since nicads should be completely discharged on a regular basis
i spent a few hundred dollars on the camera and im well on my way to spending an equivalent amount on batteries
thats absurd
i bought another brand of camera recently that uses standard aa batteries and im much happier with it
i use nicads instead of the liions it came with and theyre working great
proprietary batteries sckyup wrong battery doesnt fit the canon s sure would be nice if the description was corrected
wasted money and a pain to returnbought it for my canon powershot s
battery didnt even fit in the slot
obviously they have mislabeled this battery
returnupdate they seem to have changed the description to exclude my camera
hopefully it will work for the ones listedlet me start by saying that im a raving linksys fan
ive got a phone line network that uses their products and a linksys router as well
until yesterday i was using their hpes to bridge my phone line and ethernet networks and totally loved it
i decided i needed a firewall nat etc so the hpro looked like just the device for me
howeverthe product really disappointed me
i simply couldnt get it to work at all
a few things  theres no documentation for setting up windows  to work with it
youre simply referred to microsoft networking documentation which networking documentation is up to you to figure out  the tech
support line was busy every time i called
on saturday and sunday
email support was ok but the suggestions were ones i had come up with on my ownin the end i shipped it back to amazon and bought a wire home portal  on sale at office depot
i had it up and running in about an hour with no problems at allsorry linksys you struck out on this one
and like i said im a real fan of your productsthe shutter locks closed every second or third picture
the camera then shows an error  none of my other lenses cause this issuei dont know about anyone else but i didnt understand what gray market meant
i just looked it up and it basically is a item that was not meant to be sold where they are selling it
so canon will not be warrantying this for you
this is a failure by amazon imo
amazon in a attempt to protect their customers should demand gray market be replaced with no warrantyi am all set paying  for a new item without a warrantydespite  hours of work i was unable to get this unit to worki followed all of the advice that other reviewers posted  upgraded the driverfirmware rebooted the routersystem etc
nothing
i have a laptop that connects to a wireless network at my office and its wan monitor utility showed an erratic signal strength coming from the dip
i was never able to get the dlink dwa card to receive anything at all even when i moved the host computer right next to the router
eventually the unit started failing when it attempted to get a dhcp address from the cable company
rebooting and other voodoo practices had no effect  i was now totally off the networki think im going to bite the bullet and start routing wires in my wall so i can get a reliable connection to my machine upstairsi dont think this router is ready for prime timewhen i was looking to purchase a router for my new broadband connection i thought that instead of just purchasing a router i would purchase a wireless router
well i came upon dlink and i purchased this product against the guidence of one of my friends who said the product would go bad in a few months  because it was very inexpensive compared to other companies
well i can assure you that i will never buy from dlink again
ive had this product for about  months and it has died on me just like my friend had said it would
i called dlink and the first few tech support guys i talked to were very unhelpful
but i finally got in touch with a tech guy who cared and he didnt seem too surprised that the product died
infact he said hes surprised it didnt happen sooner
so im being sent a new one and im immediately taking it back to the store to get a product from linksys
i do not recommend this product to anyone at all
it will die and has very horrible compatabiltity as it interferes with panasonic phones
definately buy a router from linksys or another reputable company that has good products and helpful technical supporti was going to replace my reliable old linksys nonwireless router with this dlink one
i chose it partly because of the integrated print serverin general it worked fine for most applications
however i also use it to access my companys network from home using vpn
this did not work well
i tried both wired and wireless modes for this with no improvement
i wasnt able to download anything other than small files and it had trouble getting updates from the corporate email serveri tried working with customer support but they werent able to helpi switched to the new microsoft wireless router and it works fine and is much easier to setupthis product is at best an engineering prototype
do not buy this if you are not very well versed in computerswhen this unit freezes the only way to bring it back up is to connect a null modem cable reset its ip address  and then reboot via a terminal windowwhen my computer is connected to this using an ethernet connection if i were to unplug the connection this unit freezesit is very unstable and this is with the firmware upgrade mine is on its way back to amazon very disappointedwhen they quit printing paper manuals some companies apparently decided why have a manual at all
to be sure this has a manual but it isnt a manual worthy of the namei bought this product and the dlink laptop card back in march and i still havent been able to get it working
with my  years in the it field youd think a consumer product wouldnt be much of a challenge but with the dearth of support from dlink and the lack of anything resembling a useful users guide  well what can i say
maybe you should consider spending your money on another brand like linksysshould be zero stars in the review but it will not accept very hard to insert the batteries poor design and cheap materialsweather channel selector is hard to workthe noaa alerts are not received by the radioweather stations are not set correctly you can hear bleeding from other weather channelswould not recommend this itemi bought it when it was  and rebate but i returned it right away
the picture quality was very grainy especially on skin and plain surfaces such as walls
i tried it both with and without the image stabilization with little visual difference
i compared it backtoback with my jvc vhsc camcorder and it was worse
not what i expected from digital recording
i am not a hardcore camera buff just a very casual user bought my jvc as my first video cam  months ago to film my new baby
the picture quality problem is very obvious and not acceptable
i assume that better digicams are not this way
the still picture function has even worse resolution when displayed on a tv and is completely unacceptable for this use didnt try it on pcworked great i was very happy for about  minutes recording time
after this started getting progressively worse problems with pixelization during playback
at the price i hate to return it but will need to it is totally unacceptable
too bad it was acceptable before although not the sturdiest unit in the world
sharp needs to work on their product validation  obviously there is either a design or a manufacturing problem with the vlwdu based upon my and other peoples similar complaintsi have had the camera for  years and i have gotten the eject the cassette problem
it worked fine until dec i wonder where to use this lens with the new and better lens in mm fthis is an obsolete lens by my definitionyes yes  of course its a great piece of glass but nikon d needs an afs lens and not just afreturned it for a refund
the afs macro is 
great
i switched over to olympus e camera which i feel is a much better buy a much better system
nikon is an icon for people who either want to burn money or demanding professionals who understand that a professional quality lens costs thousands of dollarsnot hundredsnikon has lenses that sell for  to 
that is professional
but for a macro the mm is a huge fast sharp piece of glass if you have a non afs camera bodyignore the reviews on this lenses its not good
i dont know what the heck everyone sees it this lenses
i didnt get anything better than with a kit lenses
i am a professional normal photographer
i have a local biz and i do well
this lenses isnt for active pro photography
perhaps if you have  minutes per shot youd do well
as the other reviews say about low light dont believe them
i never had success
im using nikon d d d because i will never ever sell this camera
i love the d too and hate the dthis was not an autofocus lens for the nikon dx
it needs a camera with the motor in the camera
i got this to shoot pictures in a gym without flash basketball volleyball rallies
even though i maually focused the lens through the viewfinder most of the pictures came out out of focus
it was alos difficult to get the right exposure settings
it just didnt work for what i wanted
i sent it back
fortunately jr music took it back and issued a refund with no problemsmy nikorr x i currently use all the time
every time ive taken it off my d and used the mm lens i regretted buying it
after using it a couple of times ive removed it from my camera bag and as of yet not missed it al alli can no longer use this lens after about  years of use
the bodies i have had no longer read the lens
beware of this issue with the lens i have read this happens to a lot of people
spend some more and get the gif you bought or own a d do not buy this
it is not compatible
stick with the recomended sb or sb
i bought one without the camera shop sales clerk correctly pointing out that i was simply wasting my money
now its an expensive paperweightthe flash is not so reliable as it goes off just after a few shots and the battery signal indicatesi got both nikon  and rokinon images produced even on my d is too soft until feven rokinon  f can be nearperfectly sharp at fi cancelled this order and replaced it with the    mm lens
so i can not provide any feedback on this lensand the owner said its necon probably translated to english as the con artists from japan and probably will not work with older nikon models but with a plenty of lubrication with oil pumping dx camera it may workwhy did human invented the word caveat emptor
this word didnt exist before nikonthis drive came with a bent jumper pin i bent it back into place hoping itd still work but when i plugged it into my machine the bios did not recognize it
i do not recommend this driveif these hard drives are new then i am santa clause
they make more noise the a freight train
very disapointedi ran crystal disk info on the drive and it had over  hours on it
worked but thats a lot of hours
so you dont get confused it had over thirty three thousand hours on the drive
you can get new ones for less money on that famous bidding site
amazon does not have new older drives
i spent hours and hours until i got smart and bought a new  gig seagate with zero hours on it at the other place to get stuffi bought this to replace an old drive in an old dell
i opened the package the drive was poorly packaged
then i connected it to my testing rig and ran wds data lifeguard diagnostics test on the drive and it failed every test
this is western digitals own hard drive testing software tests the drive at the lowest level and it failed
these are not new drives and not worth the timenever helped me and i ordered  or  and all died within minutes or doa terrible why all the hard drives going dead
wowwowwowwowwowi read mixed reviews so i rolled the dice and bought these
absolute garbage
in their little bag they are quot thick
they sound very quiet
no bass expected and no midrange not expected
the front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet
they certainly are  degree speakers  they sound equally bad from all directions
even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables
my original comment to my wife was quottwenty bucks how can i go wrongquot
well my answer now is i could have still had my 
now i just have to find someone to give them to as they are not worth the space they take up
i know you get what you pay for but if that was the case here then should have been on sale for half off at the  cent storethese speakers would have been a perfect compliment to my portable dvd player due to their size and portability however the volumn was minimal even after purchasing new batteries
these speakers were beautiful in appearance but wiring could be more substantial
speakers should be shipped with dc power supply to improve performancefirst  i do have to say that the camera is relatively easy to use and takes very nice pictures
however the battery life with this camera has been problematic since the first day that we received it
we have used several different batteries as well as different battery chargers in an effort to rule out other problems
but this camera continued to be a problem
eventually replaced with a sony dscp  and havent looked back since
glad to be rid of this camera  very frustrating when you are trying to use a product to record your familys memories and constantly run into problems with a quirky camerai bought this camera for the many features and the nice lens it has
unfortunately it wont take my brand new gb card from sony
i also tried my gb psp card and it wont workthe famous c error comes uptheres a  mb old out of productioncard that might work but the cheapest is about  and is not even newyou cant buy a new one either since theyre not made anymore like i saidi got one of these at work to be used primarily as a dictation device
it is almost unusable
there is no cue forwardreverse during record
you can only pauserestart
cant edit your files
cant insert in middle of file
voice quality is great thoughbased on the marketing the olympus dm digital voice recorder should be a nearly perfect tool
combining as much as  hours of recording capacity if you expand the memory to m with quality mp playback is an attractive combination
especially for someone like me who has a borderline need for a dvr but who is attracted by having music playback capability
the price is high but i thought there was every reason to expect the synthesis of two quality machines would be worth the costalas this was not to be
on the good side the voice recorder is simple to use with easy to deal with buttons and functions
mp playback is good as well
the display on the machine is legible and quite straightforward
and the dvr software dss player installs easily and works with no problems
unfortunately from this point on the news is badfor an expensive digital recorder is surprising that it only provides for three folders with  untitled recordings in each
it is also surprising that there are no features for inserting and appending to a recording
this makes the dm a useful only for unsophisticated recording
sound quality never great in dvrs has a lot of noise even in standard recording modefor music the supplied earphones are unacceptable
they are extremely position dependent and refused to stay in my ears if i moved my head at all
but the real issue on the mp side is the supplied software  musicmatch jukebox not the player itself
i have a perfectly ordinary winse machine
the software installed easily enough and it created some mp files from a cd but could not see the dms disk space
i tried this with smartmedia cards from several different suppliers and they all failed
however i could move the files to the cards directly as they appear as a disk drive to the system so i could have managed
playback by the way is quite acceptablewhat cinched my full negative was musicmatch in the end
this destabilized the usb lines resulting in repeated system hangs and finally compromised the registry
when i checked their email site i found that i would have to but the real version of the software if i were to get any help
when i did email them anyway i got a very unhelpful response and then nothing
you may draw your own conclusions but i think olympus should really look elsewhere for a provideras i see it i paid a premium price for technology available for a fourth the cost
buying two decent machines and gluing them together would have been more satisfactory
i am not prone to giving poor ratings but i feel i have no choice
people who really need this functionality should look elsewherethe headband looks like it should sit flat on your head but it doesnt
you have to move the headphones around a little to get the noise cancelling to kick in and the sharp plastic edge of the band digs into your scalp like a slow medieval torture yes i have hair it doesnt help
i have been seen sitting on planes with part of an airplane pillow on my head just trying to make these livable for an hour
the low price and somewhatfunctional noise cancelling are useless if you cant wear them
order something else i ami bought a refurbished pair for  from an amazon partner 
they came in some generic packaging with photocopied instructions and a  day nonmanufacturer warrantee
evidently theres now a miniindustry of businesses that handle returns and refurbishes themat home they seemed to work
with noise reduction on they had a soft background hiss and if i moved around in some noise settings they produced an annoying buzz
on an airplane however the right earphone produced an earsplitting whine
the headphones are defective the noise canceling mechanism is malfunctioningi have a nasty suspicion that the headphones were rather minimally refurbished and that this defect was the reason they were returned in the first place
it wouldnt show up in simple testing without an airplane volume noise source nearbydont buy these refurbished headphones unless you have money to wasteive had these headphones for about a year
and they are truly awfulthey sound terrible
they buzz when noice canceling is turned on
they are very uncomfortable
and they dont work very well at cancelling the equipment noise in my cubiclea coworker who tried them jokingly suggested that the buzz was the quotnoise cancelingquot feature because he couldnt here the equipment fan noise in his officelab because the buzz masked it
my experience is the buzz just adds to the noiseive tried to give the headphones away twice
both times my coworkers have returned them
id recommend that you seriously look at other noise canceling headphonesthis is by far the worst camera i have ever purchased
thankfully ive finished mourning and can now move on with my lifei purchased a  last dec st and have yet to get the promised  rebate
ive made many telephone calls and as near as i can find out nikon sent the rebate to the wrong statebased on a lot of reviews i also purchase a lot of accessories for this camera and am very displeased
the lcd can not be seen in ordinary daylight and thus you will not be able to use the menu system
dont buy any of the add on lens as they block the optical view finder and again the lcd is useless in daylight
if you want to take photos on nice sunny days find another productthe ball bearing tightens into place against a small piece of aluminum about as thick as a soda can
needless to say the first time i tried to adjust it it broke
its truly a piece of junk
dont buy itthe tripod head was never strong to begin with and after only a few uses with a powershot sd the tightening screw cracked apart the entire headnaively i purchased a second mini only to have the same thing happen in the exact same way
i think ill stick to camera beanbags nowadayswent corrupt and i lost very important pictures
dont take the chance with viking compactflash cardsviking products has been nothing but trouble to me
yes they are cheap but their product quality is just bad not to mention the equally bad customer servicejust like the title says it worked two weeks then died
since this was within amazons return period amazon handled the return without hassle
i recommend getting the better albeit more expensive cards such a simpletechi purchased the  mb viking flash cardand  months later the card is no longer functional i am in the process of getting it replaced but there is no reason why the card should have malfunctioned so quickly
i have used it over  times
i had the impression flash cards lasted a long time
i also own four mb flash cards from viking and those have never given me a problem
i also like to add the  mb is a very slow card much slower than the  mb viking card
i recommend the mb compact flash card but stay away from the mb
there must be a reason why viking cards are so inexpensive and lexar cards so expensive
my next purchase will be a lexar card and i hope i wont be dissapointed againi returned thisthe curve on the headband was so severe that it hurt my head to wear and the earpiece came apart in under an hours useonly  earpiece as designed so it will not ever give the best sound however the sound quality is fine for its design
the end of headband piece curves in too far that only the end piece touches the head
very uncomfortable
didnt even use it for more than a minute  there has got to be better designs than this
returning iti do not recommend for use with speech related software
the plugs require the use of the soundcard and can or will create major headaches
spend the additional  dollars and get a usb hookup andyou can bypass the sound card and avoid the pain that i encountered
i use usb with dragon naturallyspeaking and it works fine
it would not work with the plugin type hook up using windows returned because it was not usb as i thought
i must have read the listing incorrectly or it was listed incorrectlyi am giving this item a single star because it does not come with an adapter such that one can either reduce the two plugs it comes withone is for the mic one for headphones to a single plug in or to a usb plug in
almost all other manufactures do supply adapters for the most common possible hookups such as a single headphone jack or usbmy daughter had to purchase these headphones with her own piggybank money because she had damaged  sets in a short timethe last pair was a brand new set that came free with her rosetta stone software which worked well and were far better quality than these
also the one from rosetta stone had a mic and a single plug in that went right into the standard headphone jack on the front of the computer
unfortunately her rabbit chewed the wire on that pairi was able to finally find a configuration for which both the mic and headphones work and aggravation one should not have to go through
the plug in configuration was at the expense of unplugging the speakers
worse i looked on kosss website and found that they sell the usb y wire adapter for  keep in mind that the headphones are 
i think this proves that koss has in fact heard of usb which is still one of the most common connectorsfurthermore the widely practiced nonstandardization policies of the electronics industry as a whole are horrible for the environment
think of all of the extra stuff that one has to waste their time and gas buying not to mention the waste of nrg that goes into manufacturing adaptors as a result of no standardizationthese headphones represent one of the prize winning environmental offenders in this catagory non standardizationyes one could argue i should have called the manufacturer and asked if they had considered that this product would necessarily only be used for sound and voice on a pc  and as such had they made any effort to ensured it could be plugged into a pc with ease
gee i dont know why that didnt occur to me before we purchased themloved how it felt on my head  lightweight and easy to wear
it worked fine for a couple months then just quit working
it wasnt like it was overworked
i used it just one day a week at our satellite officesounds terrible
voice cuts out
microphone sticks out in front of your face
go with the plantronics  instead its a great headsetarrived in a box when i opened it the smell nearly knocked me over
these arrived with a smell that can only be described are horrid
burnt electronics and then some ive fried my share of motors and transformers and allenbradleys
these speakers are coated in something that reeks of this odorive had them sitting in my backyard  too smelly for the garage  and i am hoping the full sun here in az will cook the smell off
so far they still stink so ill probably ship them back
i cant imagine what the car would smell like had i installed thembought four and put them on a  x  amp two blew within the first  hours of use and the ones that didnt blow started rattiling and sounding terrible in less that a month
there is no way these can hold  watts they couldnt hold i received it within  hours of my purchase and appreciate for quick free shipment from amazon
however when i installed it into the pc that stopped working right now i did not see anything on the monitor
i had previous memory installation experience and it was easy
the memory was in the right place with the tabsnothces were put together so it was placed correctly
i rebooted the pc but nothing happened
i tried  times without any success
at that time i had noticed that that memory stick was very hot
then i called to pny tech support  provided on the package and that person told me that that memory i received from amazon was defective and return to amazon
it was ok to return the item but i could not reboot my pc
he told me to removed the battery from pc and unplugged it for  hours to reset it
i waited  hours and put everything back and turn it on
nothing happened
i called again to pny tech support and waited min and they suddenly cut the line
i tried again and waited another  min and they cut the line again i heard the ringing tone then suddenly the line was cut off  twice
i cannot wait another hour to be cut off again
it seemed like they are avoiding my call and they already knew that new pny memory caused my other memory sticked burned
i saw little burned on gold edges of the sticks both my old memory stick and new pny i purchased from amazon
my pc was not only unimproved with this new pny memory but i also lost my existing good memory stick mb
this meory stick is pretty expensive and i chose brand name expecting for better quality as well as improvement for my pc but now i even lost my good one and cannot use my pc
you cant tell any difference for this pny stick until you actually installed into your pc
dont buy pny for their quality uncontrolled and poor thech support
the automated voice will tell you check the problems in their website
how one can check when the pc was not working
you have to wait hours to pass automated voices to get live support and wait more hours to get the live person if youre lucky
they dont hesitate to cut off your line anytime
amazon should have negative stars and this pny deserves neg starsupdate my pc is not working anymore and not repairable
pny tech support supervisor told me he had to deal with a couple of similar problems per month imagine how many people suffer the same problem with pnys defective items and nobody got compensation according to pny policy
never buy pny productsbought these for listening to my mp player without undue disturbance of others
it certainly accomplised that
i could not hear them right up against my ears
too light for a paperweight so completely uselessi bought these a few years ago and terrible treble
no wonder they were  bucks
on top of that the bass sucks
these speakers are terribleyou can barely hear anything that comes out of these speakers
they were a waste of money and i regret iti got these speakers as a gift and i plugged them into my ibook g hoping they would bring a little bit more sound quality than the itty bitty ones on the laptop
they sounded worse than if the sound was coming from a can and they are very quietwell i got these for free at a garage sale so i cant complain too much
these do have their application
if youve got a kid who likes to play computer games and you dont want him or her to crank up the sound so that you can hear it all through the house then these speakers will be right for you
you just plug them into your computers speaker output crank up your computers onscreen volume controls all the way and you can actually hear sound
amazingi really feel sorry for those who ordered a pair and paid money for them
sony has proven it can build junk like the bestoruhworst of emthese speakers produce a quarter of the volume my laptop speakers have
not sure what the point of these speakers are but my laptop speakers have three times the quality as thesedont buy these speakers they are so low you can hardly hear them
i had the first pair replaced because i thought there was something wrong with them but the second pair was no better
i wanted them for my mp
at work i ended up using a pair of dellharmankardon and the sound is amazing get them for  or less at ebay at home i use a set of cambridge i got on ebay for about 
it has  speakers w subwoofer i plug my mp or my sony cd player and the sound is excellent
we use it has a stereo system since the volume goes way up perfect quality
so dont buy these they are garbagei ordered this radio after my midland z broke and i really wish i didnt
this radio is junk
i had a good antenna hooked up to it and the radio signals were weak and came in and out constantly
the mic is cheap and bulky
the soundtracker feature is useless
fellow cbers could not hear me when i talked to them
the only good feature is the weather band other than that dont even waste your money on iti wasnt able due to schedule to install this immediately i suggest you take off work if you dont want to take off then i suggest purchasing a refurbished unit to start with i am on my second one that squeals when you key the mike i cannot return it to amazon because of the excessively long time it took to get it from amazon and cobra to return any correspondense telling me it was a radio problem i cannot return for a replacement amazon says i cant i have to send it in to cobra to get it repaired so i have a pair of  brand new repaired radios i could have purchased a refurbished radio a lot cheaper and got as good warranty else where install this immediately i am using a cobra antenna on channel  i have  swr and channel  swr  it changes so little the eye cannot see it the antenna works great just cant say anything to anyone because the tranmitter just squeals  i just today got this back  from cobra does the same thing and now they started the same ole procedure i started in the first warranty claim beware i am going to can this and mark it up as never buy cobra product againi was looking forward to using this product
when i received the cb radio i find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as i thought it connects directly to the vehicle battery
cant do that so it is going back
i give amazon one star for not making this clearbought this in april and installed in may
received great but could not get anyone to acknowledge receiving
bought it because we are leaving tomorrow for  months in alaska towing an rv and i thought this would be good for road info and in case we have a breakdown
after trying everything to diagnose the problem i sent it back to cobra for repair
turns out it was off frequency
so they tuned it and returned it
upon return it would not receive as well and i only got acknowledgement of transmission twice out of about  attempts
this was even on major freeway with big rigs going by with the cb antennas on them
it also would only scan occasionally and would stick on stations where there was no transmission
called them and told them i was leaving in a week
they authorized a return and included a ups label but for regular ground service from pacific northwest to chicago
i told them at the time i didnt think it could make the round trip in time and he assured me it would
we were supposed to leave today but delayed a day waiting for this and other items
a week after shipping there was no phone callno email and no cb radio
i strongly urge you to stay away from this unit and cobra in general
local sporting goods store told me they stopped carrying coibra frsgmrs radios because of all the problems and now i believe it
pretty disgustedi wasnt very impressed with this antenna at all
upon taking it out of the box the rubber cover that is supposed to be wrapped around the magnet mount fell on my garage floor
this thing is a cheap piece of junk
save your money and your time and get the little wil
the rubber that is wrapped around the magnet is beyond cheap and the rest of the antenna is not very impressive either
mine went back to amazonbase loaded antennas are not worth a damn
center loaded like a wilson trucker  or top loaded like a firestik ii will out perform this antenna unit arrived in a box that was sealed with a stip of clear tape on either side looking like a  year old did the job
the box was sealed together so badly the tape stuck to the items inside causing you to rip everything apart
the antenna itself is just a cheap poorly painted metal rod whose thin paint arrived with a chip
as soon as the flimsy package was opened the few parts there were fell out and went about the room
 part never to be seen again was the tip that covers the end
as stated by other reviewers the rubber base is nothing more than rubber that is quite literally as thin as a condom
the decorative plastic piece at the base of the antenna is the same plastic youd see on a cheap water pistol
if i could give this cheap item a zero i would
already bought a quality antenna elsewhere
not worth the time and money sending it backantenna arrived missing the set screw used to trim and hold the antenna in place
contacted cobra via email about obtaining a replacement screw but after waiting for  days for a response they do not stock any replacement parts
their suggestion was to return the antenna to amazonvery disappointed as i have now had a new and utterly useless cb radio for two weeks with the prospect of at least another week going by before i can use it
when i get a replacement antenna ill be back and do a proper review
just wanted to let people know if the antenna arrives missing parts or unusable for any reason dont bother contacting cobra
and it raises questions about any warranty they may offer on thisproduct does not work could not get reception even bought good attena still could not connect i think it is junkthese headphones are truly awful
they are not worth it for any price
they sounds exceptionally bad are not at all comfortable and dont stay put
i replaced them withsennheiser pmx i sports inear neckband headphones  blackwhich fit well in my ears sound good and dont shift around at all
they also have a button and a mic allowing for phone calls etcnow you have to pay on amazon for absolutely same item not  but  
amazon its insane scam
i want to reorder this item today   what a disgusting surprise  from shopzilla i can get for  bucks same item
but im still loyal to you amazonthoughif you will keep holding on this scam any longer you gonna loose many loyal customerswaiting as an apology same item i paid  for absolutely free
note all sellers who start cheating s of buyers must be eliminated immediately
thanks always yours alessyou can get these at walmart  and currently on overstock for 
and there are other ones listed used for 
are they filled with meth or made out of gold
this makes amazon look badnot impressed
i went out to a store and found a much more comfortable pair of headphones
ordering this particular product was a futile waste of my time
they are now just sitting on a shelf collecting dustthese headphones were great when they cost around 
they break eventually though i did keep a pair for around  months with daily usage which is great
every single set of running headphones i have used regardless of price have eventually died a short in one ear or overwhelming static etc
these were the only pair that i could run comfortably stayed in the ear did not overcancel noise so you dont get run over
i must have bought at least  pair over the years
unfortunately it seems sony has discontinued them
bad sony
i want these back
no headphones can compare for running ease
however this price tag is one of the most ridiculous things i have ever seeni decided to try these based on all the positive reviews and the price
i run  days a week and lift at the gym  days
these failed the workout testthey kept falling off in the gym during various movements and while running they invariably needed adjustingthey may be ok for casual listening but are not intended for sportsi had these only a few weeks when the left side stopped working
now less then a year old the right side stopped working
waste of money threw the whole thing out bc it is useless now
do not waste your moneyi used these on my ipod
i also used these for running
the sound is ok very little bass and kind trebly
they lasted about  months then stopped working all the while they kept deteriorating
the cord is very thin and very weak
i stepped on it twice and the wiring became exposed
the cord ultimately looked like an electrical taped mess
the left channel stopped working after  months
i wouldnt recommend these to anyone who is going to use these for working out in any way
i suppose they are fine for commuting or general usewhile the design looks just like my older model the audio range is not the same
these are very muddy  tinny with a narrow range in sound
i should have double check the model  before ordering these
these will be my emergency backup headphones i guess but i doubt ill use themthe head phone doesnt stay in my ears
the sound quality is just horrible
i hate this
just put it in a box and never use it
dont waste your money on thisi keep check to see if they have gotten good sense and lowered the price
no
now they cost 
ill keep checking
these are great but not sturdy
when they were cheap i bought onepair to check them out as most earbuds drove me nuts
these were great comfortable almost not there
big shock
every time i checked they were more
so now they are better
they break so they need to be cheap
ill keep trying but i assume it will be futilei buy many headphones they all start out fine
but after using them a couple of time for running one of the sides stops working and they constantly shift when you run
i find it very annoying when you run you try to concentrate on your running but instead you have to constantly fix your headphonesi tried everythingi almost skipped this product due to the low price and what i assumed would be poor sound quality
unfortunately i was fooled by the good reviews and place an order
the sound quality really is poor
i had the volume on up to full on my ipod and could barely hear the music over the background noise in the gym
what little i could hear was tinny and barely recognizable as music
this is not an antisony rant  i have gone back to my tried and trusted but more expensive sony mdrasj
they are double the price but  times the qualitythese headphones are extremely flimsy and lack the kick needed to accurately reproduce music and even speech
the sony mdral was the benchmark of the vertical intheear design
its a shame that sony discontinued the mdral in favor of the overly cheapened mdrwli bought these earphones for  last december
i got about  pairs for giftsdo not pay  for these
i will write to sony about this and also contact amazongoogle this earphoneyou can still get them for about i want to know if sony or amazon is ripping off the people and i will find outlets see i bought these in may and now its september and guess whatno just guessok i give you  guesses they work superb  no wrong they work average  no wrong they suckhahahahha yesss they suck
they already stopped working
the sound breaks up real bad and i have to keep turning the knob around to hear cept when im running it not so convenient
well what do you expect anyway
want my money back imo
brojust gouging in my opinion
bought these for a third of what is being advertised now
i highly recommend looking for something else
these are pretty cheap and certainly not worth more than  to  bucksi ordered this unit on may  of this year 
it is now july  and i am having to buy more headphones as the wire down next to the plug has broken on one side and i can only hear both channels if i hold the wire in a certain position
the sound was quite acceptable they are nice and lightweight and the overthehead band was easily held in place with a ball cap
but they are just too fragile for me to be able to recommend themhead phones do not stay on head
i have a lot of hair so maybe that is why they fall off
useless for me to usestill no comment  not happy
i dont want to say anything bad
so i was just saying and no comment i receive item 
box was in great shape
one of the  buttons was very hard to turn on
speakers would not be independently operated
had to tunn on switch  if i wanted switch  to worki think this thing is a real piece of junk its been a while since i bought iti didnt hook it up right awaybut i may try to return it
its looks pretty cheap you cant clearly tell if you selected a speaker or not by the internal red marks in window like solid or blank they dont really move that much
and now after just a few weeks the button selector is starting to not even change on or off when i push itother relieves of this product were good so i took a chance on it
but i would recommend against it nowbought this in april  the left channel was blown out when it arrived and i returned it
i then bought a replacement in may  and the complete left channel has blown out again by november  with no return possible
the price was right but the product fails to hold up
buy something elsethe selector i received added noise to the speakers that wasnt there when the speakers were connected direct to the receiver
also one of the selectors buttons was broken when i received it
i ended up returning this itemi had this for two days before returning it
im hoping mine was just a bad one from the factory
if not buyer bewaremy biggest issue was the selector buttons were extremely sticky
way more difficult to depress than they should be and would actually engage only  of the time
granted it was a  piece but honestly felt like something i should have paid  forhoping your works better than mine didthis only worked a few months
blew out
period
i dont know why it was blown out if it wasnt plugged into huge powerful speakersusing mac g and os  downloaded newest drivers from sandisk website
when plugged into usb port wont allow the computer to shut down or restart
puts  icons on desktop when compact flash card is inserted
very difficult to insert compact flash card
consigned to garbage can
a complete waste of money plus postage
too bad  ive had good luck with sandisk products beforei bought my dimage last spring and it had a defective battery compartment
the defect was obvious the first battery powered images i got are summertime of if it had worked out of the box i would rate this a four star cameranot being able to find the sony  meg cdr discs which worked flawlesly with my camera mvccdi purchased the memorex discs
first problem was the very short initialize time with these discs
second when the camera is turned on the first message is sony discs work best
third the battery icon does not function properly
the battery was fully chargedi took about  pictures  x  indoor and outdoor and the quality was terrible
finalizing the disc appeared normal and viewing in the computer most of the pictures were underexposed with colors way off expecially the greens
the contrast was also off
of course this made me very unhappy because i would get great pictures with the sony discs
now i suppose this camera is good for the junk heap
original cost was 
about a month later the discs started working well enough that i am using them and the contrast and colors are not as good as the original discs but acceptable
it almost seemed like the camera had to get used to the new discs and overide something in the electronic world of dingusses
jjki bought this device and brought it home with great expectations
i was disappointed
first off the company does not make xp drivers and the only drivers you can get for it work with music match jukebox
thats ok if like me you use music match
however the drivers are beta versions and they are not approved for use with xp
not only that whenever i turned off my computer and plugged the device back in to reload mps the computer forced me to reinstall the drivers
i was willing to live with that but i was not willing to live with the problems that i had once the files were downloaded
everything seemed flawless until i started playing my music back
it seems as though parts of the song dont make the trip and the music seems to skip
very annoying and frustrating
this problem happened on both of my computers at home which use xp pro
however when i used it with my computer at work running win k everything worked great
so the bottom line is if you dont use xp and you never will this is a great purchase
if you do use xp this little thing with give you big troublethis mp player only lasted two weeks in my possession
despite new batteries the unit never played another tune after limited use
would not recommend this for a purchase
now i guess i know why it was  off the regular pricei bought a rio one back in september  and at the time felt like it was a good deal
however since then i have experienced two problems that lead me to strongly advise against getting this player of my use is in the car with the player hooked up to a cassette adapter so i didnt realize how bad the sound was until i decided to use it around the house one day
the high quality ear buds that come with the rio one were its downfall because they accurately reproduced an annoying lowfrequency hum that didnt exist when playing the same mp files on my computer through the very same ear buds
email with sonicblue tech support resulted in an rma for a replacement unit
when i received the new one it also exhibited the hum so i have come to the conclusion that its a design flaw and an unacceptable one at thatthe second problem ive had is downloading songs to it from a mac running macos x   several times my mac has gone unresponsive after dismounting the rio ones media forcing me to reboot
also several times the songs were not cleanly downloaded leaving portions of the previous downloads songs toward the end of the newly downloaded tracksi have given up and replaced it with a nomad iic mb player which now comes with headphones by the way unlike the mb version
so far im very impressed with itto make a long story shortit was purchased as a birthday gift
worked for less than a month and completely died
does nothing nada zip
no support  no replacement
cheaply made piece of junk
please read all reviews on this product before purchasing it
recommendation  buy an mp player from another companyok i bought this product and it was working fine for a while as long as i was only playing runathamill basic mpz
the wma experience was somewhat less consistant with some tracks not playing all together after a certain point
i could not ascertain if it was the encoding of the particular files or the player that was the issue
the player worked fine with a  mb smart media card i bought also until one day it couldnt boot with the card anymore but booted without it
tech support told me to go try out the card in another player suggesting i go to a store and use one of their units to test my memory
yeah right
their lack of good advice forced me to figure the problem out myself performing a tricky operation of loading firmware without the card then putting it in then unplugging it from my computer and letting the firmware reformatt the card
it worked for about another month
now it will not boot at all with or without a memory card
i bought this product to be durable
i bought it to take my music with me
now it reminds me of a dodge truck because it is really like a rock
buyer beware
i know the price is enticing
i know it looks good
however you pay for what you get
you dont want a pet rock
you want an mp player
go get a job and spend your money on a real player
check out some of rios other stuff or just shop around but avoid this onei remember back when the ball had some mass
on this newest model the ball is so light its too easy to work
how is that a problem for me
i wanted to get away from mousing on my desk
having used the older model before i was looking forward to that familiarity
i feel it is easier to control and develop a feel for something that gives you feedback that lets you feel something as you work with it not just skate awaythey have gone the way of most everyone else cheapen it up and sell it for the old price
sorry it isnt for methis item is about two years old now it was used on a laptop the whole time
it failed slightly after the two year mark because right where it plugs in at is not reenforced at the connector and tends develop a open in the wiring where it flexes often
this is a poor design feature by logitech
you can find refurbished ones identical to this one all over the internet because they all develop this problem due to faulty cable
i do not know if logitech ever fixed this problem or not
it involving replacing the defective cable from the plug leading into the mouse
i did this to mine and it is back working as it originally did new
logitech had to know this was a problem and yet mass produced and sold these shame on them for the wireless and  for the wired version what a ripoff
youre better off with the wireless trackballexpected delivery date was 
it is now  and the usps site says out for delivery
cant get help from either site
will never use usps again
ill give two more days for two weeks and request a charge back on my card
cant find anywhere else on amazon for help either so ill make sure i order from somewhere else as welli have owned about  of these and they break with use fairly quickly especially when you use them for movement in a mmo game
i have an issue with the price being listed here considering this is old tech and not something new or even all that sophisticated
the seller is price gouging because this item is no longer sold by logitech the parent company
anyone who pays  for any mouse is a little less than special edalso the tech support is not very good
read the forums
i would just buy another product and i am ready to junk my uniti purchased this firewire cable to sync my sony camera to my macbookpro
the sony was not recognized by my mac
as i do not have any alternate electronics wfirewire output i do not know if it is a cable problem or incompatibility  between sonyapplewrong parts for what i ordered it for and they said it was the off brand and it sure was
i would have returned if it were worth my time and effort to do soi ordered this product as a replacement to my desktop setup migrating a digi to my laptop
upon arrival i noticed that the metal piece that covers the  pin and connects to the laptop is completely missing from the chord
unsure if this was done on purpose and thinking the metal piece maybe in the packaging i open it up to find nothing but the chord itself
so needless to say this product was purposely boxed up with a visible defect and cannot be returned because i opened it with optimismit doesnt work with my cannon hv like someone told me it would im sure its a great product but now i have to shell out another wad of cash for the right cordthis cable was supposed to replace my ft cable between my buffalo external firewire raid and my toshiba laptop running windows  ubuntu  and mac os  in none of the oses this cable could establish connectivity
plugging any of my other ft cables in established connectivity right awayi do not have any other devices to connect with this cable but i am pretty sure that i am not dealing with a length issue here
if the cable was too long for the voltage i think my fw hd would at least be somewhat visible to any my oses instead of complete silienceso i need to classify this belkin cable as defective right outofthebox and am returning it
am ordering this one now insteadhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbprexisrqidrefolpproductdetailsieutfmeqidsrselleri have been using these to backup data with a roland vscd recorder which uses  to x mediawhen it came time to restore the data i found out that every single disc i had backed up on this media was unreadable 
i have over  of themi tried them in the computer with a nero disc quality test which came to  surface scan showed between  and  defect accross all discs i also tried burning them on the computer and the results were no betterthese are the discs made by infodisc 
as mentioned in another review they are the worst
sure you can write on them but dont count on being able to read when you need toavoid at all costs i purchased this to help a friend who needed a replacement lens for their dslr and didnt want to spend a lot of money
unfortunately the lens arrived and its obviously made for use on film slr cameras despite all the commentsreviews that imply that it works with their digital slrs
i dont know if the lens i received was just incorrectly labelled or sent by accident but i had to return it
it was very disappointing and thankfully i had another day to help my friend and ordered another lens that cost a little more but was clearly labelled for use with dslrs so she could use her camera on an upcoming vacationi do not recommend this walkman i have it and batteries only last a couple of weeks and that is when i bairly use it maybe  minutes every other day or something and this is using good duracell batteries
cheaper batteries only last about a weekwere constantly needing to reboot this gadget after it declines to transmit packets
we suspected the dhcp server but switching to static addresses didnt fix it
it clicks all the time
why
its powered by a wallwart
what is clicking
the os is pathetic
the ui poor
contrary to an earlier reviewer who probably didnt rtfm it does offer a firewall which runs entirely steath checked against dslreports and grcstill we wont buy another netgear box after this shoddy experiencethis item did not work out for me  range was limited to a single room within my house
returnedi bought this thing about a year ago and it worked pretty well
for a while
but after having to reboot the thing every few weeks i started to get a little tired of itnow i am not trying to run a lot of machines through it  a linux box on ethernet a sony clie tivo and an imac over  plus packet for my phone service over ethernet
no great strain on the processorso why does the thing insist on locking up so much
to add to the problem you can be going along just nicely on ethernet and suddenly the  diesnow asside from the thing croaking and needing rebooting weekly i get to do a complete factory reset once a month wiping out all the stuff i have programmed into it wep keys etc because the thing will completely quit respondingone would think that the problems are related to something overheating
but no that is not it
that leaves the units firmware to be suspect
after reading about netgears sloppy code writing and their dos attack against the university of wisconsin time servers i have to believe software is the issue
if they wrote code as bad as that which caused the uofwisc flood i am sure awful code abounds in all their productsthis netgear router will lose its connection often to wirless cards in computers that have netgear wireless cards
after ten months in servicethe tranmitting mode went outcalled customer service for a rma numberrequired and told to hold for  minutes
never got through
buy another brandterrible product the fp was a much better quality
after putting the pack in the camera the th shot pulled out  shots with it
wouldnt recommend to my grandmotherthis is a totally counterfiet product from this seller  do not buy it  you will not only be disappointed with it but amazon will make you pay return postage even though the product is not as describedit is listed as nikon but it is totally not
buyer beware this item sucks and you will be ripped offit is so far from being genuine nikon it will make you laugh or cry
this seller needs to be blacklisted
they are a total frauddont waste your money on this one
i purchased the sp for christmas and it gave me a full  hours of performance before it failed miserably
i couldnt figure out why
the disc kept spinning so the battery level wasnt low
only there was no music coming out of the player at all
i tried regular audio cds and data cds with mp songs but it still would not perform
ive made about  online purchases in my life and have had to return maybe  items
this will be one of themprosnone even the case looks like a toyconwhen it worked the player skipped constantly
unacceptable since i used to have a panasonic cd player with  sec memory that never skipped on me even when joggingin cold weather the disc would not spin up to speed and thus would not produce musicwhen battery runs low cd spins but no music producedplayer takes forever to seek mpsshort battery lifethis player skips when playing audio cds
it doesnt have near the  sec antiskip protection it claims
i can not play cds while walking with it in my bookbag
it skips too often about every  secsi keep seeing rave reviews about this mouse at various hardware sites
i simply cant believe any of these reviewers actually used the mouse
this is the worst mouse ive ever seen  i set it up on three computers at two different locations and i got the same result on every one of them  the mouse lags like crazy
if you stop moving this mouse for any length of time like sitting and reading an article it hibernatesthen when you move it it takes up to a second to wake up
this same problem affects the scroll wheel so the mouse arbitrarily skips clicks when moving the wheel
i returned this mouse to the store within  hours of buying it
do yourself a favor and buy a ms optical mouse with a cord
they are wonderfuli wrote a review on this item  months ago and i had originally gave it  stars but now i would have to give it just  star
after two months of using it under normal conditions it finally broke down
such a shame because i was only starting to get use to the on again off again battery saving feature that made me lag in games
so for an item that is no longer working after  months i would not recemmend this to anyone
im sorry microsoft but you dropped the ball on this onei bought this because i loved optical mice
but after about  months i began to have transmission problems and it kept freezing up for a few seconds at a time
then minutes then froze up for goodi should of know that a microsoft product wouldnt last long
right out of the box i could tell
very cheap feel to it
good thing i kept my old mouseim sticking with logitech
they make much more reliable mice and i never had a problem with them
so avoid this microsoft one and stick with logitechim a  years old gamer you could say that i play around  to  hours a week normally a mouse last me around  year and normally is dust the cause why i change mouse this mouse begin to malfunction after  monthsfor showdown is very nice very impressive very comfort etc is all but a dollar mouse last more than this
im sad since i even buy some recharged batteries for this mouse hopping that will last a lot of timeif you dont play maybe this mouse is for youyou will impress your friendswhen i first got my kodak dx camera i was pretty happy
yes the memory card is too small but otherwise it seemed to have all of the features i was looking for
the first few photos looked pretty good as well
however with continued use the camera simply doesnt perform
after taking only about  photos the camera now refuses to take any more photos and those last few photos were out of focus and either over or under exposed
changing batteries helps for a short while but even using crv lithium batteries rather than aas after a very short while the camera refusues to perform other than to let you see the few photos youve already taken
im not aware of other cameras that consume battery power like this so my plan is to get rid of this camera and buy a new one sooni am embarrased to have given two of these for christmas
i bought for one myself and if the ones i gave are as unreliable the recipients may never rent or buy another dvdwell it worked fine at first for a cheap dvd player but after about  months it stopped working
when i put in a dvd it says disc error when i put in a cd it plays for a few seconds and then crashes
but even if it hadnt abruptly stopped working id still have plenty of complaints subtitles
i had to turn them back off every few minutes
every time i interacted with the device at all subtitles came back on
i didnt notice any of the other reviews complaining about this so maybe it was just a quirk unique to my machine the mute button that should be the power button
in the upper left hand corner of the remote there is a big red button
the power button
no thats the mute button
there is not power button on the remote disappointing and confusing mp support
but thats not really a big surprise mp support seems to generally be a quickie feature most manufacturers add on just for fun
still its a feature i care about so id like it to be reasonably useableit sure looks nice and it was a good value for the price but im pretty upset that it just stopped working all the sudden
so im going to have to file this one under posbring it home
spend two hours loading it up with songs and all you get is hd error on the display
taking it backi had this adapter running in my the cardbus slot of my windows  computer and it ran fine
i installed it on my windows  laptop
well my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when i installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by microsoft
so imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got blue screen of death bsod crashes
big blue screen loss of data computer freezes tight power button inoperative and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer well we all know thats when youre in computer hellim a microsoft certified professional so i was able to narrow down the source of the problem
after definitely identifying the fa as the culprit i contacted netgears online  tech support
and thats when things really started to get uglyit took forever for netgear to finally give me an answer
this was after days of inactivity wildly inappropriate responses and repeatedly requesting same information from mefinally netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and i was shocked to read their solution this is a windows issue regarding permissions and  bit compatibility mode while they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled their solution was straightforward i was directed to a microsoft knowledge base article which tells you how to enable compatibility mode  and for bit compatibility mode i had to make my nice clean windows  computer compatible with windows  yes ninetyfiveso while the fa hardware is a bit cardbus adapter apparently their drivers are bit
no wonder the fa was never certified for windows  and i wouldnt trust it for windows xp eitherthere are other ethernet adapters out there by com belkin linksys smc and xircom that work flawlessly with windows xp by companies that will respond to your questions
go get them
avoid the fafor a month now i have been trying to get my ma to work with my cisco  base station with no luck
i can associate with my base station but i have not luck when i try to connect to the internet
successful pings are intermittent at best
i spent some time with netgear tech support and they have not been very helpful
truthfully i was surprised at their lack of trouble shooting effort
im going back for one more shot to see if i can get it to worki have been able to use this very same base station successfully with  other  adapters from other vendors so i am confident that the problem is with the netgear
i have also tried  different netgear adaptersif you buy this adapter keep your receiptive managed to keep my windows  system stable for over five years now mostly through a rigorous and sometimes annoying process of keeping my system files safe my registry clean and the startup files to a minimum
i thought i might even set a world record for longest use of a microsoft product without a major system crash
unfortunately this diminuitive little terror was too much for my poor system and it finally gave up the ghosti bought the netgear mr router and two of these ma adapters one for my win system and another for my winxp system
i will say the router installed without a hitch
these things on the other hand are junk to put it mildly and the tech support staff were about as helpful as a blindfoldfirst off the win system just could not recognize the device upon startup
it would show up in the device manager but as disabled
the only way to get it working was to remove the device reinstall it and reconnect to the network every time i started the computer
even this process was slow and annoying taking well over two minutes while the system hangs and tries to figure out what this foreign object is
based on the other reviews here you will note that im not the only reviewer that has had this problemtech support
well this can take anywhere from five to fortyfive minutes and assuming youre not hung up on you might as well start dialing the instant you have problems
reason
even though i told the techs repeatedly that ive done all the basic troubleshooting like removing and reinstalling drivers removing unplugging and reinstalling the device etc they make you go through the entire process anyway
after three separate calls totalling an hour and a half of hold time and another hour and a half of reinstalling things the best the tech could say was reinstall windows
this is techspeak for i have no clue
against my better judgement i did it anyway except windows messed up the reinstall
one computer dead one to goim happy to report the winxp computer did install the device but there was just one slight problem
it could recognize the network and even saw the routers ssid but it would not connect to it
here we go again
after two different phone calls and a lot of inane disconnecting and reconnecting the best the techs could tell me was it was due to interference
strange considering my other computer could recognize the network fine before meeting its untimely death and its the same distance from the router
again techspeak for i have no clue
ironically i did manage to get it to work after i hung up on the tech
dont ask me how because i really dont knowso now after the added expense of a windows xp upgrade and the loss of an entire weekend i have my network set up
one final problem
if i try any wep encryption keys i will lose the connections on both computers
i was able to get the router to allow access to these two computers only
assuming this actually works that should be secure enough but im still not too keen about all my data passing back and forth unencryptedhopefully this review will convince you to look elsewherewireless range on this is weak
i have an intel card that reads  bars when this adapter reads  bars
i like netgear equipment but cant recommend this adapterthe exp should be avoided unless you plan to use it as a desktop model and you get it for next to nothing
want to jog
prepare for audio torture the skipping is atrocious even with the apparently useless esp feature on
i returned one for speeding up think chipmunks about halfway through some discs
the replacement does this as well
also i now note poor scratchy sound at the very beginning of most discs
the sound is ok when these problems arent in effect
the mp labeling system is a joke just numbers and no way to skip ahead by more than oneto its credit the exp is an inexpensive cd player that also supports cdrs chock full of mp files
it basically means that you can carry  hours of tunes on a single disc and enjoy those tunes on a single set of two aa batteries
i picked up one of these units yesterday and i returned it today for the following reasons horrible sound quality
all my mps exhibited a random pop click or some other audio artefact during playback
and no i wasnt listening to oval microstoria or any other mego glitchery and all these mps are  kbps cbr constant bitrate files that play with no problems in my pocketpc
stability issues
i used my unit exclusively in a car a ford taurus in fact sitting in the front seat armrest that did nothing but city driving
admittedly houston streets have their share of potholes and bumps but my wifes vw cd changer which doesnt have the readahead shock protection is far far far more stable than this player which produced random skips with alarming regularity
navigation problems
the display on this unit is limited to numbers
which means that when you create cdrs of mp files you have to organize them in folders by either artist andor album in order to be able to skip ahead albums worth of tracks at a time
even at that youd have to have a pretty darn good memory of what order let alone which artists the tracks were burned onto disc
having to play name that tune with your own music collection is only entertaining at parties
compatibility issues
despite the reported cdrw compatibility none of my directcd cdrws would register with this unit
also any regular cdrs created using the joliet standard which allows long file names seem to have the file orders scrambled as the file names seem to get truncated by the players operating system
in order to maintain track order i had to manually rename  files in easycd creator a bit of an oxymoron in this case to  standards trying to compose the disc in iso truncated the file names without maintaining track orderso there you have it
a nice try but poor poor execution
from what ive read the exp series are significantly better in sound quality skip protection and compatibility so you may want to spring a few extra dollars and save yourself a potential headacheafter pointing out that the casion be does have a backlit screen and many adjustments i just discovered that i cant transfer my microsoft outlook address book to the unitim retired now but dont have an infinite number of years to figure it out and refuse to go back and key everything in with a stylusso back in the box it goes to be disposed of at a flea market or maybe ill send it to a year old kid i know who has lots of time to play with iti see its being sold as a clearance item
not surprisedah well live and learn
or so they tell ussteve quinni had three of these bad things for a month each
the first two stopped recognizing graffiti and became useless after learning how to freeze and lockup at the worst times
after the third one started shutting itself off while i was using it i tried to return it at circuit city where they told me they could not take back a third unit
i managed to convince circuit city to give me a sony cliethe clie works just fine after  monthsto be clear i am a big hp fan i own their laptops both at work and home and ive used the jornada  before i upgraded to the  but im very disappointed with the performance of the new   ive had it one week and let me tell you the glitches
first ive had to reset the device at least once per day
second sometimes it turns offsometimes it doesnt after pushing the power button
that is simply unacceptable third sometimes the backlight works when its supposed to sometimes it doesnt
the activesync w avantgo has been highly unreliable perhaps  out of  times max does it sync successfully
the last time it synced up it erased the settingschannels that were setup w avantgo
i am so disappointed because i had really high hopes and expectations
sure the chip is faster but you know its still croaking under the weight of the software
hp has really let a longtime customer downi have a different model kodak camera however they all use the same easyshare software
running windows xp i could not get the software to work properly
after several hours on the phone with kodak tech support they couldnt get it working eitherthey said they are aware of the problem on some computers running windows xp
it is now several months later and they still dont have a fix
they dont really seem to care eitherit might not be a bad idea to consider other brands instead of kodak
since if the software wont work properly then what good is the camera the  min recodring is not usable as the sound quality is tooo poor
it should have been advertized for only  or  min recording time
one way download so onece you download and delete the file from the dw cant get it back on the dw
its a major setback if you do lot of recording and might want toreveiew while not with the pc
guess its to protect the mp players
the claimed directional mic sensitivity is worse than human ears
as of oct nd  the olympus website does not list the dw driver software any more
surprise 
conclusion price wise its a bad buy  but compared to the basic analog recorders its stylish and kinda workablemy magellan meridian platinum has somewhere around  to  hours of use during elk hunting seasons during the last two yesrs
seemed to be ok unit when it workedi took it out this year sept  and it didnt work
changed multiple sets of batters and nothing
tech support in india is terrible
you explain what you have done they seem to listen then they begin asking questions in poor us english that starts with stupid questions and covers what you just told themfinally after several calls i find that magellan has set a  repair fee
i cannot express how mad i am at a company that sells a high end gps and it fails and they abandon any responsibility
if i ran over by a car i would expect them to charge me
but sitting in my hunting pack in my basement hardly constitues abusei cannot recommend any aspect of magellan
ps after lodging a email request i never got a responsemy roommate had a nikesonicblue psa  already installed on my pc uses rioport sofware
intel audiomanager and the included version of musicmatch simply did not work due to some conflict with the rio software so i was out of luck
since i knew the rio player and software worked i returned the intel player and picked up a nike psa which works well
be forewarned that intel has stopped supporting this product
on the style side i thought the included faceplates were ugly and the whole faceplate attachment felt flimsy one more small plastic piece to break the first time you drop iti ordered the philips hs
i received the philips shs which is a much cheaper headphone
i notified amazon that i received the wrong item
they sent me a replacement which was another set of the shs
i called amazon customer support and got a refund
dont order this item unless you want to pay twice as much as for a set of philips shsthe hp  was my first digital camera purchase and it was an absolute failure
despite using kodaks at work i was lured by the lower price on the hp unit
that was a mistake because as a professional photographer pointed out to me afterwards computer companies generally dont make good cameras
right away my hp  went through batteries like there was no tomorrow
at first i thought it was just a powerhungry unit it does take  aa batteries after all
one evening i took out the camera and got some photos of a nice sunset and then came back indoors
instead of putting the camera away i set it on my desk and noticed that the flash was firing intermittently
i checked and yes the camera was turned off yet the redeye reduction flash was firing
that explained the multitude of dead batteries
i removed the batteries and the flash kept going off for at least fifteen more minutes possibly longer as the capacitors bled off their charge
i placed the unit back in the box and returned it the next day
i got a kodak dx and have been very satisfied with itokay anybody could get a defective camera
this is what else i found wrong with the hp  focus  this camera has a weird focus
even though the manual says it will focus on the center object in the viewfinder if there is anything else in the frame with greater contrast the camera focuses on it instead of your intended subject
 flimsy  the camera is made primarily of lightweight plastic and it feels like cheap lightweight plastic
the wrist strap partially obstructs the compact flash door on the side
the battery compartment lid works itself loose with normal camera use
the camera is too small for adult hands
there is no lens cap
there are no indicator lines in the viewfinder to tell you where the edges of your photograph lie
 picture quality  all pictures from this camera seemed overexposed
to get proper color balance i had to use a graphics program to adjust color levels and hsbfor a few more dollars you can get a much better camerahad this for about a week and it worked ok until one morning i noticed a strong plastic smell
opened the battery compartment and smoke came out
returned for refundi tried this cb with a  inch antenna and it hardly got out a half mile
i bought it because i thought i could traffic reports and police speed trap locations from the truckers
very poor performer even with an adequate antenna
plus on the highway the truckers dont use cbs anymore and the few that do wont talk to you anyway
i traveled for hours in silence
sure not like the seventies anymore
its a different world now with cell phones
dont waste your money unless you are using it within a few hundred yards to talk to another car
mine went back to amazoni bought this for entertainment use and when received i tried it on all i got from all channels are nothing but static
so then i decided to purchased the car type cb antenna with an adapter for it
i am still getting nothing but static noise
i wasted my money on both cb radio and the antenna plus the adapter
these midland cb radio n the midland external antenna are piece of electronic junks
do not recommend at alldont waste your money they should pay you to take this piece of crap
an american name and they are supporting chinas economy
if it was made here i might have requested repairdidnt work for my application might work for others but just didnt have the transmission power i needed
looked like a good value but didnt cut itthis camera was horrible
picture quality was the only good thing about itbatteries  i burned through  aa batteries in the first day
think about it
its like getting a laptop and having to plunk  d size batteries in it to use it
any small mobile electronic item that does not come with a lithium ion battery should be avoided in my opinionlens cap  piece of garbageshape  very awkward in you handsand much much morei returned mine and bought another brandfor the same amount of money look to other brands youll find that they offer all that this lacks at similar pricesbought these headphones in september
ive used them off and on for biking and put them in when im walking around campus
tonight i realized the rubber casing on the right earphone had worn off and the circular metal sound piece had become loose so it is detached from the rest of the headphonenot durable enough for my active lifestylethese sound great for a short time  but quicky broke within a week
my son went through  pairs in a month
you do the mathit didnt pick up the voice sound clear at all
sounded like i was in left field trying too get a voice level for recording my singing
for me not good but for someone else that justs needs it in a conferance room maybe it will work fine
thanks againthis seems like such a great idea but these levels are not worth the bother
the bubbles are so tiny that its not possible to get the camera any more level than you can by eye
and my copy was not accurate
setting the camera level with a real carpenters level left this tiny guy off centerand better yet nothing holds this thing on but a little friction
one of mine fell off and was lost on the first day out
great idea but just does not workthis product may work fine on plug and play systems x  but i couldnt get it installed under nt
worse yet i got the nt bluescreenofdeath at startup and couldnt even boot my computer until i removed the card
linksys tech support in the afterhours had an estimated  minute wait so i called back during regular hours when they should have more technicians and i just got an answering machine they still havent returned my calli thought id save a few bucks by going with this product and have really regretted iti just could not install the drivers
it would bluescreen during the installation when it appeared to try starting the driverpc compaq deskpro mhz running winxpnikon should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this piece of junkwhen it does work it produces superb imagesexceptional sharpness great detail and accurate color
the problem is it usually doesnt workive had to send it back twice with problems and it still doesnt work right
the zoom gets stuck and the autofocus doesnt lock on
there are major problems with this camera and nikon wont do anything about itnikons service is horrible
unapologetic no answers no solutions
long hold times
they dont offer loaners
they dont offer anything for people who depend on their products to make a living
it would be bad enough for everyday consumers but at a professional level its unacceptablewe bought this camera for small digital shots done in a professional environment
so not only have we lost the  for the camera but also about  in billable jobs
i understand that sometimes things go wrong and if they do you have an obligation to fix the problem
nikon is not doing this in any waythanks for nothing nikon
im tossing the whole matter over to our attorney for followupi recently bought this card to add on to my hp desktop computer
the card went in easy enough but thats when the problems started
i put in the disk that came with the card but over and over my computer wouldnt recognize the card or the program on the disk
i kept having problems occur one after another and other programs starting to fail due to this mess
after almost losing the computer on the second occasion i was forced to take the card out of the computer
all problems ended immediately
ive had no problems with belkins cords and wires but their cards and hubs ive had nothing but trouble
do yourselves a favor and dont get this item
it could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash
its not worth your hard earned money to see your computer crash and burn is it
if you need to add a card find yourselves a different brand
i myself am going to try adaptec
hopefully that one wont cause me the problems that i have gotten with this oneim running xp spinstalled card easily
did not install any drivers since im on xpnone of the usb ports worked and the only thing recognized by my device manager were  strange new audio interfaces
in addition i quickly discovered that now all of my original builtin usb ports on my machine were either nonoperational or would show the connected device for a few seconds and then id get a popup saying that the device is plugged into a usb  slot and may not function properly
try a usb  for proper operation
 i dont have any usb  ports
this card somehow crippled all my usb portsplayed with it a little bit but after reading all the bad reviews on various sites i decided to just take it outunfortunately even though the card is out i continue to have the same problems
it must have installed something or corrupted my motherboard somehowive tried all the troubleshooting options
gonna have to reinstall windows and start overadd me to the list of people who think this thing stinks
ive got a  ghz dimension  w  mhz fsb  ram and a  gb hard driveand this thing manages to crash my system every time
oh yeah a top of the line ati graphics card tooi dont know what the problem is but the program freezes every time i start it up
it asks me to reinstall the software each time i reboot the computer
oh the cd it came with didnt even work either it had junk stuck all over it and it wouldnt read
i downloaded the drivers and software but that didnt work either
it just keeps freezingon top of this the one time i actually got it to work for  seconds or so the picture was grainy and horrible and there were popping noises coming from the speakersfrom the gunk stuck on the cd i think they might have sold me a refurb or somethingim about to call tech support and go nutsi give this player one star because the antiskipping does not work
i like to take long walks and listen to books or music
i bought this player so that i could put an entire book on one cd
actually you can put a bunch
but when you try to listen to mps or regular cds while walking it skips alot
the only way that you can walk and listen is if you walk very very very slow and hold theplayer in the palm of your hand so that it is horizontal to the ground
ive gone back to my  year old philips magnovox cd player with its  second antiskip because it does work although i have to use multiple cds again for listening to a bookthis antenna has a lowprofile inobtrusive look and comes with a builtin   db amplifier with adjustable gain
however the passive part of the antenna the dipoles which actually pick up the signal from the air and convert it to electrical signal fed into the amplifier and further into the tv appears to be mediocre
this is not surprising since it is known that efficient antennas usually have their geometrical size comparable with the wavelength of the signal which they are designed to receieve
for the channels  through  or so the required size is in the meter range
the jensen product is a lot smaller than that which makes me think that they sacrificed the performance of the dipoles in favor of making the antenna a lot smaller and tried to get its efficiency back to the quotrabbit earsquot by using a builtin amplifier
i hoped that it would work slightly less than the cheapest quotrabbit earsquot antenna that i already have  but in fact i got extremely poor reception even at a maximum amplification  much worse than i had with a primitive dipole antenna
i had to return this product
in my understanding it would work only in the areas with a direct view of the transmitter unobstructed by terrain features where the sensitivity can be traded for a small size and easy wall mount
i find the jensens claims that it provides a better reception than nonamplified antennas wrong and misleadingi wish i had read these reviews first
uninformed i bought this when i couldnt find either terk i wanted
this worked the same or worse on every analog station than an old unamplified radio shack antenna
i couldnt get any digital stations for more than a split second
i normally would include info on the testing circumstances but this isnt worth the space
try a terkhdtvaortvinsteadi thought i bought a great purchase with these
no
junkpure n simple
i think they put them on sale to get rid of them
youre watching a great surround sound movie or whatever and thenpsssssssssst phhhhhhhhhhhht
static and like a motorola razorit drops your sound on you while youre listening
you have to move your head this way and thatget up and change the settings  or  or more times to get it right stand on your head turn around  or  times and then turn around  or  more times the other way to get your sound back oh yes i forgot say hale mary grace about  or  times to get the sound to come back
im thinking about taking these as a trapshooting target with me sometime
lets see other nounscrap oh one more thing i believe it would make a great boat anchornot that greatthe wireless reception is substandard and it wont compare to any sennheiser on the marketgo try sennheiseri bought these but promptly returned them
they are underpowered leaving lots of static and squeaks in the radio signal even from  feet away
also the signal often drops out for no apparent reason and it may come back in locked on to your neighbors headphone signal a block awaydespite the high list price and fancy branding these things are total junk
i suggest cheaper infared models if you want to avoid noise
if you need through the walls wireless a cheap set should perform better since they usually do not include the auto signal lock feature that leads to losing the channel youre listening to
i suggest staying away from acoustic research which is just an expensive brand for the cheap electronics manufacturer recoton
that said recoton at a low  price should be finegood sound lightweight  but it stopped working altogether in just about a month
now i have to deal with repair or return
not such a good deal after alli live about  miles from boston and  from providence
i bought this to takeon camping trips but it cant find a station where i live so im quite sure itwill be totally useless in rural areas
its a great item is you wish to watchthe search bars go back and forth and listen to static otherwise this is a totalhunk of junk
i have to think that previous reviews were somehow written bythe bandits that sold this to mei bought this vcr for hidef video editing export hd footage to dvhs tape and as dv backup storage store several minidv tape contents to one dvhs tapein both applications this deck fails miserably
it just doesnt talk to the computer via firewire noway
jvc tech support didnt help one single bit  all they said was quotits a driver issuequot but they dont release the driver for their devicein short if you just want a vcr that may take input from a camcorder through firewire  maybe its ok if you want to output video from your computer from adobe premiere ulead mediasturdio pro or videostudio microsoft windows movie maker  just forget it
doesnt work at all
i cant express my disappointment strongly enoughafter reading all the reviews i decided to pull the trigger and went ahead with purchasing this lensit was shipped two days later and i immediately performed several test to check sharpness iq and bqwhat can i say sigma and their quality control has done it againthe lens was loud and not as sharp as i thought it would be
soft unless you are shooting at around f and lowerthat is allsigma mm f ex dg aspherical macro large aperture wide angle lens for canon slr camerasi have tested this lens on  different canon bodies two d one xti
lens front focus a lot
periodi am currently returning this lens to amazon for an exchange
i will not return a lens to factory to have it recalibrated
i have heard people returning it to factory  or  times and lens still come back bad
it is sad and i am just furious over sigmas qa
how is it possible they miss such bad copy
do they not test lens anymore
why cant they create a department specifically dedicated to testing every single lens that gets shipped
read below regarding condom testing
is this difficult to implement
no
will sigma win more customers if they do
yes
heres the plan  setup a few workstations mount the camera on a fixed post in such a way that its not ever movable tether camera to computer shoot in jpg and view image either via ai  mtf score so theres a threshold to either reject or acceptwhat are these lens ceo thinking
this comment goes out to all lens manufacturers
i cant wait until theres a lens manufacturer that will implement the above test and take the industry by storm
in fact scribe the employee id onto the parts on the product line so that they figure out who is the culprit and dispense disciplinary action
i paid  day over night dhl to have this lens rushed to me because of all the excitement but boy was i disappointed
i can only hope the next copy will be up to factory specalso note that customers do zoom into the image
so testing must be done at  viewing
whether i zoom in or out the picture is just a low quality fuzz
i am a wedding photographer and i have many lens canon and tamron and i do know how to test lens
i think the mtf threshold idea is brilliant and the employee id on the parts is critical to getting high quality products
actually employee id to whoever assemble that part  lens
companies should form a division to accept returned lens take apart and find the culprit and trace employee id
this is long over due  how is it acceptable to have such poor quality controlid like to knowa where are the qa managersb do companies only care to mass produce and sample test once a whilec  how long does it take to build a lens compared to electronically test a lens
if every condom is tested electronically then why cant lens be tested
a quality condom is less than  dollar each
somebody got to be held responsible for these poor quality lens
if the above review is true that its sharp then the lens design is sound so the issue is qaupdate i have purchased and exchanged at least  copies of this lens through amazon
read comments belowmm is my favorite fixed focal length
wide enough to get candid shots and great for street photography
unfortunately this has been the softest lens not sharp out of any class of lens that i have used
its going to be an immediate return
i am very disappointed in this lens
sigmas new line of stuff ie  is excellent high quality stuff
i have quit a few sigma lens and this one is by far the worse
i know the mm and the aperture may be enticing to some but do yourself a favor and stay away from this lens
it was so soft that i thought my copy was busted
it also does a lot of hunting in low light
you may lose a shot or  waiting for this thing to focus on the subjectwhy is amazon warehouse deals charging  for a used  year old ipod
thats just crazy
it was definitely worth that much  years ago  but thats more than a new warrantied ipod touch with a color screen wifi apps more solid state storage that wont wear down like a hard drive and is considerably lighter than this boat anchor
oh and this is firewire only which is just useless in  this has to be some kind of pricing errori always used to love sony products but this walkman adapter is the worst product i ever had to use
my first one broke after a couple of months and thought it was the daily wear and tear so its perfectly understandable
so got another
ns one broke after a couple of months and finally the  rd one within a year selfdestructed inside my player
yes i know you probably thinking it was my player but i took it to the sound shop and they looked at it and found no problems
so hopefully this review reaches people and shows are bad sonys quality control has become
for myself i have resorted to the speaker phone of my phone until i can purchase a new unit with aux in from the money i save from not buying anymore adaptersi have a very old version but same model number of this adapter for years
it got used daily for years and i only had the connector fail from lots of use
i replaced it at least  times but the cassette worked greati got tired of replacing the headphone connector and figured i would order a new one and an extrathe new adapters came in a package with a copyright of  it the exact same model and vintage as mineonly on this new only the left channel works
i tried it on different players different tape decks and only the left channel works
on both adapters i ordered only the left channel worksso i am still the hunt for a cassette adapter that worksthe first time i used this not only did it not work but it jammed in my stereo in my car and i had to pry it out with a butter knife
it nearly ruined my stereo
maybe i got a fluke bad one because i have never seen sony products of less than great qualitythis little cassette is super loud in our two tape players it sounds like it grinding inside the tape playergarbagemade in china wont work in my  chevy pickup
i bought another one at autozone same thing wont work either
thats  places i bought this product from and even though they were different brands the common denominator is china
i checked my cassette player with a beach boys cassette and it worked fine
my truck  is a  did cassette players change since then
i doubt it
so thats two  that i lost trying to play my walkman and iphonei got a brain fart and forgot we have a radio shack
called the store and he said the ones i bought were cheap ones and his worked
cost me  but sure enough it worked
i tried this new cassette adapter i bought here on amazon in my wifes all in one stereo and sure enough it works in a door cover loading type cassette player
ps the  cassette adapter was made in china toowhen i wanted a cassette adapter to hook my mp player to my car stereo i decided to buy a name i thought i could trust  sony
i thought wrong
i received the adapter plugged it into my player then popped the cassette into my tape deck
from the sound it made i thought my cassette player was ruinedjust for the record my vehicle is a three yearold toyota with a factory installed system
i rarely use the tape deck but when i have used it it works perfectlyi looked at the other reviews online went back out to my car turned the dolby nr off and changed the side of the tape that the player was trying to read and still got the same wretched noice and the player constanly trying to flip back and forth from side a to side bat this point i was sure the problem was in my player
then i borrowed a generic apapter from a friend
no problems with the generic one that had already been used for hundreds of hours but the brand new sony cassette adapter has yet to play for one minuteas a matter of fact after looking at the sony adapter sitting in the cd cubby hole in my car for nearly  months i got fed up and threw it in the trash can at the car wash  which is exactly where it belongedfor as much as people rave about this and the sound it produces i was really disappointed
i knew there would be a decrease in sound quality but it was huge
it literally sounded like i was playing tapes again
so to me i didnt find the need to use it unless i had long road tripshowever it has stopped working after sporadic use over two months
i tried it in two different cars and it just keeps popping out with error messages
sighthis doesnt work in my  hyundai santa fe
the tape player rejects it and the stereo display shows broken tape
i am going to try some other brands of tape adapters hoping for a difference result
at least this can be a warning to other santa fe ownersi understand tape players are a dying breed but for the cost of this the least sony could do is make it quiet  road noise can only cover up so much
if you plan on listening to anything that isnt music like a podcast for instance youll hear this grinding squeaking creaking cassette loud and clear
then again if you only play death metal at maximum volume then maybe you wont noticedont bother with this unless you plan to mount outside your home
inside the home this thing isnt very good and its way too big
explore other options stay away from this antennai connected the antenna to my mitsubishi with an integrated hd tuner and could not receive stations with any consistency
i mounted the antenna in several locations indoor and out including on a mast on my roof and reception never improved
i purchased a cheaper conventional outdoor antenna and reception is perfect
i live approximately  miles north from the towers in dallas
very disappointing for the pricethe tv performed very poorly pulling in only  digital stations
using unamplified rabbit ears i got  digital stations
i really cannot understand why it performed so poorlyinstead i purchased a traditional uhf antenna radio shack   with transformer   and got  stations with the antenna in my attici think the real problem is not lack of signal strength it is a problem of multipath interference
the tv is not a very directional antenna
so i think it was getting a signal directly from the tv tower and a second signal that was bounced off of something
the second signal is delayed and conflicts with the first
the result is the the samsung sirt hdtv receiver does not know what to do with this signal
in other words good signal strength but bad signal qualitythe radioshack antenna is more directional
so it doesnt get this bounced seond signal
the result is a solid signal and good image on the tv seti am only  miles from the broadcast towers so perhaps i am especially prone to multipath problems
your experience might be differenthowever i cannot recommend this antenna
try a traditional uhf antenna to receive hdtvim trying to pick up all the major networks overtheair hd signals at my home about  miles north of denver co using a directv hd receiver h
ive tried an indooroutdoor radio shack antenna and this terk so far
with them i was able to pick up about half of the dozen or so hd channels from denver
im very disappointed
the terk didnt improve reception over just the coax cable lying on the ground near the tv
and i put the terk up near our secondstory high roof when i tested itthen i actually picked up all three major networks abc cbs and nbc with the small antenna that came with my dish network receiver thats used to receive signals from our rf remote that we use upstairs in our bedroom
i used that tiny antenna in conjunction with the small amplifier that comes with the terk and received more channels than i did with the terkanyways im taking the terk back to mcgukins hardware in boulder co  one of the best hardware stores in the world
and will look for an outdoor multidirectional antennaim quite near tv transmitters so a decent signal should not be too hard to find
though a couple of channels came in reasonably strongly on the tv reception is very poor over most of its range and the included amplifier make absolutely no discernable difference to anything
how poor is the performance
well i got a better picture on a wider range of channels by touching my own thumb to the coax connector than by leaving the tv connected
since my old rabbit ears get far better reception for less money than it will cost to return this dud to amazoncom ill stick with them for nowthe reception on a small tv in the kitchen with rabbit ears was rather poor so i bought this amplified antenna and mounted it near the ceiling behind plastic blinds pointing broadside toward the transmitters   miles away
the reception was terrible next to nonexistent
im still using rabbit ears
a winegard sensar iii gs in the attic of my ranch style house works great through a splitter to two other tvsdo not buy this antenna i try all three my hdtv and find out i get better pictures without this antenna
big heavy jokwhy in the world do any of the reviewers think these sound good
i thought that the brand name would mean quality but these are complete junk and sound like plastic junk
polk ought to be ashamed to have their name on this producti bought the polk rc i speakers for a multiroom sound system in my home
if you like classical music where crispness and full range fidelity are important this is not your speaker
highs are muddy and lows are virtually nonexistent
midrange is adequate
i have owned polk audio floor speakers and these are in no way comparable
i did a sidebyside test with some mk s home theater speakers and the polks sounded washed out and flat by comparison
for low volume background music these speakers are okay but audiophilesor those who know what a good quality speaker should sound likewill not be pleasedim giving these speakers a  star only because there are so many  star ratings that isnt deserved
otherwise id give these speakers a  stari purchased a set of these from amazon for a surround sound based on the many recommendations
because they come in pairs i stopped off at the local frys store to buy a single center speaker to complete the set
frys had all of the polk series setup in their sound room so i compared them
after listening the rci and then listening to the tci i have to say i regret buying the rci
the tci makes these speakers sound flat and the quality approaches that of a mid quality boom box while the tci sounds fantastic
the salesman told me that the rci are polks entry level ceiling speakerif you can afford the extra money and are installing into the ceiling buy the tci
if you are mounting in the wall stay with the rci as they are not as deepanother consideration too is that if you are putting these in the ceiling and have blown insulation you will want to handle that somehow
i wrote polk audio and there solution was the insulation doesnt matter but if im really worried about it i could put a stocking around the speaker
i was surprised with that response
it doesnt deal with the dead sound you get when the speaker has insulation all around it
if you clear the insulation away you defeat the purpose of having insulation in the attic
other speaker manufacturers offer enclosures designed to fit their speaker with the correct volume and sound baffles polk audio does not
i also noticed that if i didnt box the speakers that the sound carried into the attic out the house vents and into other rooms through the ductworkyou will definitely want to build an enclosure to house the speakers in the attic
i did that then buried the box in insulationyou also want to use a good twisted pair speaker wire instead of ordinary speaker wire
this eliminate the  hz hum that will be picked up from the  house wiring that is probably all over your attic
i used monster cable gauge inwall speaker cable ulapproved for inwall use and thxcertifiedcheck your wire run lengths and if they are longer than the spec you may want to get  or  gauge wiringthis is my second sony remote of this type
this one lasted only  months before the volume and channel keys stopped workingsony
never againtdks use of the word premium is misleading marketingi was aiming for a special collectionquality tape in a  size and was taken by the name premium
dont do as i did
instead  before you purchase  check tdks website to see that their premium tape is a standardquality tapeas of  i still dont see amazon offering any tdk super pro or ehg tapes any longer than  minsof course  years after my original review i might recommend joining the st century getting rid of the vcr and switching to a dvd recorder with integrated digitaltv dtv tuner for free overtheair staticfree programming and recordings
get one that can use dvdram for enhanced recordplayback functions
you might be convinced to give up the cable tv eliminating one of your monthly billsthe default listing sold by nd street photo and fulfilled by amazon surge protectors are not legitimate and not authorized by monster
i just lost nearly  from a surge in an electrical storm and after sending this to monster they said it is not an authorized product or seller of theirs and therefore the warranty is invalidedit per other comment requestlook in other buying options and find the one that is around  which is sold by amazon if you are expecting monster to honor their warranty
sold by insert seller name here and fulfilled by amazon voids the warranty and the extended protection that you are most likely purchasing this protector for unless the seller is specifically listed on monsters authorized seller list
go here and select the product family line you are considering purchasing for the authorized list works ok but anytime my ac kicks in this thing makes my tv flicker
very annoying
didnt happen before with a normal surge protector
this was a waste of money
how many electronics actually get destroyed by a lightning strike
i think im probably more likely to get struck in my living roomhooked up my cable and internet to the splitter turned on the tv
both went off traced it back to the splitter which drastically degraded the signal to the point of both not being able to operate
the degradation was apparent on the cable tv without the internet plugged in
i realized maybe i went too cheap with this splitter seems to be held together by glue in the back most splitters also have the degradation numbers on the back but this has no markings but rca on the frontonly one of the outputs worked on this way splitter
i verified this by using known good coaxial cables and working devicesi do not recommend this item
i replaced a very old splitter to improve the signal to my tv and cable modem
the signal was worse with this problem
there are better optionsi bought this along with a couple of other rca cables and a splitter
all of them degrade the signal strengthstay away from this vendor
if you do not give him a good review he will email nasty emails to you then have the review removed from amazon
he does not ship you the item you see in the picturesi guess if you order something that was crap back in the s you should expect it to still be crap
would have loved to use it to adapt a  foot coaxial tv antenna to fm antenna on the stereo but alas im left with wedging the antenna cable in there as before
the coaxial adapter clearly has a break inside somewhere never even got a peep of signal through itfor less than  months  one screw will not be tightened so that the antenna would not work
had to buy another oneworked out of the box but then channels got noisy when there was no dvd input
then the dvd signal through the unit got all snowy
all in all the unit did not reliably do anything it was intended to do
i am replacing it with the rca crfrca  crf auto switching rf modulator with gold  plated connectors coaxial and svideo input
i have an rca in another location that works great
i tried to save a couple bucks on this unit that was a big mistakehellothe installation instructions for this device were clear however there was no ac adapter included to operate the device
that modulater was a gift so a friend could play dvds on his television but with no power supply he had no use for itjust tried to install this and when i went to plug my equipment in there was a big spark and a loud pop from this unit
the unit blew when using for the first time
i can see black burn carbon on the inside of the transparent blue plastic and a bad smell
good thing my equipment is still working which is going through a second surge protector
i got this for the coax surge protection and went to plug in a second surge protection strip that my equipment is using
beware when first plugging something into this
i tested my outlet with a testing adapter to make sure the wiring was right and it iswhile i do like the ease of this product these are the small ones and they are not twist crimp they are crimping one time connectorsyou will not get  gauge into them
they look great and will work for a smaller vintage system with spring load which i have one so i kept them for it if i hook it up again since they were cheap
the only complaint is the cheap rubber redblack polarity covers which disintigrate over time and expose your system to shorting out
diamondbacks have a great outer nonconductive shell but the flex wire they have is brittle so you need to be carefull with that and if you move speakers around a bit then they are subject to breakage
both have their drawbacks um to keep you coming back for more product but if one ever takes the best part of the other and utilizes it you will then have a fantastic connector
cant believe no one has nailed this down yet like the banana plug insertthese are not the toolless twistcrimp connectors
these are crimp on and do not work properly which is why monster discontinued them in the first place
after trying to crimp just two of them they fell off the wire
and of course they cant be reused after you crimp them the first time
very disappointed
i should have known the price was too good to be true the twistcrimp version usually costs twice as muchif youre thinking this looks like a good buy for  gauge wire be aware that this is coppercoated wire not full braided copper
i would much rather direct you to monoprice where you can get pure copper  guage wire for roughly the same pricedo not buy this wireif you have done your planning around using  gauge wire per various articles and tech documents you will not be installing what you think you are
virtually all docs and nearly every normal human assume you will be using copper wire
this wire is aluminum with a thin copper coating
sure its not marked copper on the packaging but everyone assumes they are getting copper wire and the manufacturer should know that and mark the packaging aluminum
if  gauge aluminum will work in your application fine then this wire is okay but dont expect the performance of ordinary  gauge copper wireim giving it one star because i believe the manufacturer is trying to mislead us with copperlooking wire
i can imagine someone cutting this copper coated wire into several lengths going to the trouble of soldering connectors then realizing its not up to spec
theyll then try to return the cut up wire and hear but it doesnt say copper on the label and you already cut it
what garbageif cable is not specifically listed as solid copper you can be quite sure its coated aluminum and will therefore be hard to solder and will be more brittle and subject to breakage the conductivity will also be inferior
yes it will function and give good sound but youre dealing with an inferior product
you will need a gauge larger to get the same capacitysent mine back
your need real copper wiring to get the best sound from your equipment
copper covered aluminum does not do the jobrca ahsn  ft gauge speaker wire watch out it may not suit your needs
it is not copper wire so if you are installing it anywhere that will require bends it may end up breaking on you
the description does not say that it is aluminium wire in my case it was not even copper clad wire
also it was not even  ft long more about  ft
description of item is lacking or quality is going down on the producti prefer the solid gold jewelry and solid copper speaker wire
i wouldnt mind so much if i was running some speakers in my garage that i got from the goodwill but if i want quality i should know
there is no mention that this is aluminum wire
if it is just as good it should mention as much
how hard would it be to show a  loss running  feet of solid copper vs  feet of cca
most people dont even know and rca is happy to hide the facts
i dont mind paying more or less for something but i do mind when i am deceived with sugar err copper coatingterrible cheap wire
flimsy with bad sound quality
i should have just gone to radioshack and gotten their cheapest kind im sure there would have been no difference
as soon as i replaced this with a nicer wire it sounded like i had gotten a new home theater
dont get thisconnected up my brand new yamaha amp  onkyo speakers with this wire
the left speaker wouldnt work
finally i replaced the wire with the thinner wire that came packaged with the onkyo speakers nice of them to include speaker wire  and the speaker came on
its the darndest thing
anyway understandably im now wary of this wire
i still dont understand how this is possible
anyway cheaply made very bad quality
dont buy and look for something better  dont buydont buydont buy and dont buycheap cords dont stay together unless u tape them i got  that just fall out with out tape spend the extra  bucks trust me it saves money on tape lolhad my grado sris plugged into this thing and it plugged into a little behringer headphone ampafter the jam session i unplugged my grados from it not yanked mind you unplugged and some of its innards came out on the plug for the grados
tried to reassemble wasnt successful
into the trashi got this plug so i could play my digital piano with headphones on
at first the plug seemed ok  within a week though i began to notice that the headphones often cut out or one ear piece sounded differently than the other
after fiddling around with the plug it worked again
the plug felt loose just not right
yesterday i stopped by radio shack and bought a new plug adapter and man what a huge difference
the new plug fits tightly in the jack and the sound quality is even better
the good one made me realize just how bad this one isi could only get mono out of this adapter and i tested and retested
it goes straight into the trash can and ordering a monoprice productmonoprice gold plated metal mm inch stereo plug to mm stereo jack adaptorstereo headphone plug works perfectly
i must have my tv louder than most people and that prevents my darling bride from going to sleep
i just plug it into my audiovideo receiver and then turn the volume down and just listen to the moviepurchased update after a month the brass ring came off what it was pulled out of the adaptor and the ring reinstalled
last week it was removed while my was cleaning the room and the ring was lost
this ring centered the headphone cord bayonet plug and now i must reorder but it will not the same one
all i can say now is that you get what you pay for ittitle says rca
this is a  inch plug
if youre thinking redwhite yellow or three prong or standard then look elsewhere
this jack appears to fit full fledged sterios only
it is almost gurenteed not to work on your standard laptops hdtvs game counsels or monitors
i kept the item and chaulked it up to bad luck
then made another purchase at cables to go
if you came here looking for a rca male to  female then try searching google for these products at cables to go
i had links but amazoncom took them downrca male mono to mm femalemm male mono to rca maleive done buisness with cables to go before
they are very trustworthy  ship fast  securebought this so my son could use his current earbuds while practicing on his digital piano
doesnt work most of the timeworks sometimes
not very loud when it does work
junk
you get what you pay for i guessthis case is a great little case for netbooks
it is big enough with extra pockets to hold all the extras you may be carrying around with the netbook like a power cord mouse and possibly even an external cd drive
construction seems to be high quality
i would have given this thing perfect reviews exceptit does not come with a shoulder strap multiple other buyers mentioned this in their reviews as well
i contacted targus customer service and was basically told sorry tough luck here is one you can buy for the same price as what the whole case cost you
even though the description here on amazon on targus website and on the product packaging clearly states and shows it with a padded shoulder strap
since a strap to allow it to be carried hands free is kind of the whole point of getting this case that one ommision cost it  starssome other reviewers seemed to have luck getting a replacement strap from targus but they pretty much ignored me so dont hold your breathi have decided to update this review
to explain my situation better i needed a simple backpack that would carry my work laptop which is  inches
i commute via train and metro and there is nothing worse than people with huge backpacks on a metro
that said this pack is no more designed for  inch laptops than i am an astronaut
the pc sleevebag is a separate bag with in the bag which is supposedly the designed for  compartment
it will easily fit a  inch and the hole thing is over kill for it
i wanted a low profile backpack so i wasnt one of those people on the metro
i got that but only after i literally got so fed up with the cd player pouch flopping around that i got to work and just cut the thing off
which brings me to my next point
this pack was built for a cd player it even came with a cd sleeve
i mean really who has a cd player anymore
so back to the compact design
there are only two slots in the front part of the pack one was designed for the cd sleeve and the other is just as useless
so my frustration peaks every day when i try to unpack  simple items a charger my badge my tv dinner and my mouse
the hole ordeal starts with the fact that you have to cram all the items into one slot
then the bag unzipped in half leading to greater frustration because you look like a fool trying to tap your bag at the door
everything comes crashing out laptop included because the moron that decided to design this pack said i think it should unzip in half
then there is the quality
im a person who accepts and understands you get what you pay for
this is the case here
it is a cheap piece of crap
im fine with it lasting only  months
as it turns out i only have to commute this way for six months because im a contractor of sorts if you will
so i am not going to complain about the quality
i will however rap on the comfort
it is crap complete crap
im an average sized person
mei fit nicely in an airplane
this bag however feels like it was built for child
the straps think you have  inch necki have endured the bs for one month thinking only  to go because im such a frugal person that i couldnt bear buying another knowing the short term need
but i broke down and bought the belkin
everything i have bought of targus has been crap
including the poorly functioning bluetooth ten key padas a wise consumer i read reviews and hope of your profile fits mine you will steer clear of this onei too have had a bad experience with my npfs
the first one died just over a year after i bought the camera dscp
i bought a second one and it died about  months afterward 
i dont know if this is because of the camera or the battery
i have been thinking about getting my rd battery but lucky that i saw these reviews from amazoncom
i may just hold off getting a new battery if this problem seems to be too common
after all it aint cheap i have the quick charger  doesnt help at all
i have  of these batteries and they both exhibit the same problem of fullcharge and then  minutes later emptythe info at the sony website says that if i ship the camera batteries and charger they will evaluate the problem for free
i will take them up on this i thinkread the reviews
there are too many bait and switch shipments in the reviews for me to have confidence in purchasing this item
i expect to pay more for a genuine sony battery but i wont take a chance on getting a fakeshame on you amazonthe title of this item says it is sony npfm infolithium battery but what you are going to receive is a no name equivalent battery pack
the battery is not from sony and does not have the same power ratings as that of the original battery that came with my camcorder
no where on the battery or on the box i find the name sony
the battery pack that i received is snnpfmh and was shipped to me by eforcity
this very same no name battery pack is sold by this seller on amazon for  and i paid   sh
so anyone planning to buy this item beware you are not going to get a sony batteryi tried charging this battery it stopped charging at  mins and would not say the charge is full like the original did
i unplugged the power cord and plugged it back again after couple of mins
without using any battery power the battery started charging again from  minswhen contacted seller i got an email asking if i would like a refund or replacement but would not say if the replacement is going to be a original batterypros very heavy bottom to prevent tipping
pricing was about what i expected to paycons bose only wants their customers buying their products
this speaker stand is not universal
why would bose even try to use the word universal
that leads a consumer to think or perhaps its my ignorance that universal means compatible with all speakers
this experience will deter me from buying bose products in the future
im really angry and i better not have to pay to ship this back and if i do ill file a complaint with amazon for misleading marketingi bought  of this
it is well made
i would have given this product a  star if not because it is not a good fit for older bose speakers
i have to put the speakers upside down in order to make it work
it is change of design that does not add value to new customers yet creates huge inconvenience for old customers
again in all fairness the product has no defect or something like that but it is a design change on bose part that i do not understand and do not likei bought a few of these units a month ago and none of them worked from the start
some would continuously close and open the dvd tray when plugged in asking for a disc the rest would not even open the tray  all you could hear was constant clicking until they were unplugged
i got tired of going back and forth exchanging the unit
besides the guys at cc told me that most of the ad players come back to them sooner or laterit is such a waste to produce something that no one at the factory has time to power up and check
it would not take more than  seconds to do save shipping costs across the world and maybe it would even get them a few loyal customers in the longruni would be very reluctant to buy an apex dvd now no matter what advanced or other great hackable features it might offer on paper
this unit sounds too good to be true so when you buy it make sure the store is close by so you can easily return or exchange iti bought a similar quotvaluequot apex dvd players from amazon about six months ago
the thing had an annoying hum at times but worked at first
after two months it wouldnt play dvds longer than maybe  minutes
i tried calling their service line  no one answered the phone
i went to their website and wrote to their service email address  i received no response evermy guess is they figure rightly that no one is going to go to a lot of legal trouble over a device that costs less than 
there are other companies that make lowend dvd players and other equipment  patronize one of them instead of apexconsumer reports placed these at the bottom of the list of one of their recent center channel speaker comparisons and i could not agree more
lower costing speakers performed far better
in some calculated tests of my own i found these had far less range and presence than other major brand speakers
i have a yamaha nsc speaker that provides full lifelike sound and handles plenty of powerthis bose center channel speaker was a major disappointment and far from representative of their generally outstanding audio componentspeople have a strong opinion one way or another of bose speakers
ive owned s and really enjoyed them
ive also owned the vcs center channel speaker and in a nutshellits awfulit is the epitomy of the old phrase no highs no lows must be boseto get this speaker to blend with the s required an absurd amount of gain and equalization in the receivers speaker setup
once you achieve that blend you now have to be very careful about how much amplification you apply to your system
this is due to the fact that the speaker has   drivers that will not reproduce either the upper or lower register of the required frequency response necessary to reproduce dolby digital encryted dvds
you can forget about bluray dts hd or the like altogether as this speaker can not produce acceptable volume nor dynamics with any kind of authorityive defended bose speakers in the past but this particular model is in serious need of an update
it wasnt good when it was first introduced and its glaring weaknesses have become even more aparent with todays media
the only positive about the speaker is its low profile and ability to visually blend with your system
the problem is it sounds like garbagestrongly strongly recommend buying a center channel from a different manufactureri purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up
at that time i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par
so last year i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane
the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose  was far and away the better product
the sound is cleaner crisper sharperit made watching movies much more enjoyable
i couldnt believe what i had been missing out on all these years
the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent
depending on who you ask the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system
if thats true then i wouldnt recommend bose because all youre doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me thats a waste of money
i know because i made that mistakethis sounds absolutely aweful after listening to cheaper  dollar center speakers ive come to the conclusion that this product was designed for the deaf
there are no highs all mids not impressive at all
the look is better quality than the speakerive had a halfdozen of these over the past  years and the quality is definitely going downhill
this pair arrived with a terrible scratching noise anytime the cord is moved
clearly a bad connection in the rightangle connector at the endconsidering the price i paid and the return shipping costs its not worth the hassle to return themwasted moneynever againsony has phoned this one in this is the second pair i have owned
i am an adult male that does not abuse the head phones so i am very disappointed that both pairs went bad in less than  months
wiring is miserable and breaks somewhere inside
it is not repairablei bought them because of the volume control and travel case
they are garbagedid not like this product
ear buds are big no cushions and hard to keep in your ears
would not buy this againi had these headphones for a few years then they got crushed in half in my bag
they hurt your ears after about ten minutes
they are durable though
i would recommend the kind that clip behind your earsthe sound is fine but if you really need a volume control this one is much to smalli end up trying to move it with my fingernail but its just a pain
ive alreadyordered a larger onei cant keep them in my ears for more then  minutes
after that my ears are in real pain and i have to take the headphones out
my wife has the same problem
might be ok for people with very very big earsmine broke within two weeks the right headphone started to rotate a full  degrees when it should have been only  degrees
i thought crazy glue would help but they broke again soon the week after same thing happened to the other one
tried using crazy glue again for nothing three weeks later the right headphone broke completely a thin piece of plastic that holds it to the metal rotating piece just broke
needless to say these were trash and perhaps too big for the design
had they been smaller they would have survived
i yet have to send them to see if koss would honor their lifetime warranty
very dissatisfied i paid thrice what they sell here since i bought them downtown and was in a hurry to get headphones that day very disappointedwas not on cox cable compatable list and never got my money back for iti had no real problems with this unit until last night when suddenly it just stopped working
no surges in fact its on a line conditioner and a surge protector
its got power but the modem will not function
naturally the warranty is only  years and mine is  years old
argh
look elsewhereit does not work at all
i have tried it with different locations but it never actually worked
i just wasted my money on thisi will admit that this is a very nice package
the unit is a good weight and it looks wonderful but and thats a big but this unit is proprietary
you can not convert html txt or anything else into the rb format
the software does not allow it and there are according to customer support no plans to create such software
this means you can not use your own content on this unitif youre going to buy something do not look at this uniti kinda wish theyd put this stuff on the box supports mmm filetypes so i wouldnt have wasted my time buying it
now ill have to trek back to the store where i purchased it to return it and start looking all over againfirstly  wow the price is now  listed here  that is incredible
and totally ridiculous
i cant remember how much i paid for it in november last year it was about  or  or thereabouts i think  and its now march and it has stopped working and its now listed at 
i nearly fell off my chair when i saw that
how has it stopped working
well  thats not entirely accurate  it works but the speed has slowed down like the batteries have run down  but its not the batteries because i have put three sets of new batteries in and that didnt help
its not the speed settings either  i tried two different cassette tapes too in case one had stretched but its the same  the speed has slowed so that it sounds like someone talking in slow motion
so for  or  i still wouldnt buy it and definitely definitely not for 
it must be a typo
it cant be 
i must say that amazon was amazing about refunding me  i mean its one thing if it stops working after a year but its only been used for about  months and not very often  so i think they know this isnt right
im going to get a different model next timeif you like to take pictures of the ground with your nikon d including possibly the tips of the tripod if you are in wide angle this is the tripod for you
with a  zoom lens it is almost impossible to tighten the ball up to the point that it will hold
at the point you think it might hold you are sure youll break the tightening knob using a leatherman
i think i got it i think i got it  dont got it
probably fine for a point and shooti bought three of these sight unseen on speculation
while they are nice and small and relatively inexpensive they are also unbelievable cheaply made
one of the units had a leg snap off the very first time i tried to twistdeploy the leg seconds after pulling it from the package
the axel around which the leg pivots is only a tapered screw like a wood screw screwed from the opposite side and into the plastic of leg
thankfully the price was too inexpensive to really bother returning it
ya gets what ya pay fori mistakenly ordered this because i thought i could extend the length of the legs
this tripod is a loser any camera with a little weight to it makes it topheavy and it falls over
if youre going to buy a mini tripod make sure the legs extend to a full foot in length
i have one of those and thats what i had meant to buy for my second camera setup
i made a  mistakethis is a black string with a piece of elastic thats crimped into a circle tied to one end and attached to a little piece of round plastic with some mounting tape
it should have been  with  shipping
the tape came off after a day
and now its sitting on my windowsill and sliding towards the trash bin
even when i had it on the camera lens it would clink and clank and get in the way
im just gonna put the lens cap in my pocket
i suggest you do the same with you product lasted  weeks
very cheap build
strap broke way too easily
looking for a better product
i would not recommend that anyone purchase thisnot a good value since the gummy part that holds the keeper to the cap is only good for about three weeks
if you own a nikon you know this wont work since the lens caps for this camera can behave like they belong in a space program
if you do not get them right on the camera they can pop off and launch themselves into the stratosphere
i almost took out a friends eye with one of the lens caps
please nikon  put a little hole someplace on the lens so we can attach our leashesi bought this turntable to replace an old but excellent connoisseur turntable i was using to transfer lps to audio disc
the connoisseur required a new belt at  so i thought i would buy the sonyi immediately notice a major problem  significant rumble
annoying but i could deal with this by applying a low frequency cutoff filtermany transcriptions had noticeable distortion on loud passages but i put this down to a problem with the lps
then i retranscribed two lps i had previously recorded with the connoisseur
these recordings now had significant and highly annoying distortion in loud passages
it probably wouldnt be noticeable with pop music but with loud legato passages in classical music eg choruses or organ pieces it is terrible
this is not overload as i was careful not to have linein at too high a volumeconclusion this turntable has a cheap and nasty cartridge andor preamplifier
im junking the sony and going back to the connoisseuri bought this in december  it is now may  and i have no phonograph
i wanted a turntable to play my dylan vinyl collection on
it didnt have to be fancy it just had to play records with the minimal amount of distortion
ive always had good luck knock on wood with sony products in the past
i bought this item because it was or what i thought was the best deal for the least amount of moneyout of the box it was fine beit as limited as it is
i played albums on it a couple times a month if that
i took great care of it and always cleaned albums before putting them on etc etc
well under two years and now it wont work
you push the button and it spins and as soon as the tonearm starts to head towards the vinyl it stops like its binding on something
the belt is fine it all looks perfectly fine it just wont play
i can spin it by hand and sound comes out the speakers so i believe it to be some sort of switch is being tripped just before it hits the record and causes the platter to stopof course the first thing i do is check the date of purchaseits under two years but over one  their warranty
i contacted sony and the almost laughable options they gave me were this pay for their service dept
to fix it at god knows what cost or do their exchange program which is absolutely hillarious because not only will they be giving me a refurbished turntable in exchange but make me pay  for itthats how much i paid for it in the first place
yeah im gonna exchange my broken turntable for one thats not even brand new plus pay you what i paid for the original new onelolgooooood luck if you plan on using this turntable for longer than  years
the needle will outlast the unitwe tried  of these and talked with manufacturers support
support could not help to identify why this did not function
we were only trying to control one  device not multiples as it is supposed to support but it would not workjensen  dscira remote control extenderthis was purchased thru amazon from buycom
they were excellent to work with and to return both items and credited all costs quicklythe one i bought doesnt work well
i bought it to control a dishnetwork receiver in another room
the receiver is pointed at the dish receiver and is only about feet away
the transmitter is in the other room and is also about feet away with a wall between them
it will pick up some keypresses but is basically very unreliable and doesnt really work wellabsolutely terrible
the range on the receiver is only a couple of feet at most and has no width to the reception at all
i have to set it on the end of my bed and make sure i am sitting up and leaning close to it in order for it pick up the signal
i know its not my remote because i have much better range when i had the dvd player out in the open and i can see the ir receiver flashing on my tv  feet away indicating its picking up the remotes signalthis is a complete waste of money unless you intend to put the receiver on a end table right next your chairjust remember you will have to turn and point the remote directly at the receiver if you want it to workthe transmitter relies on perfect line of sight and only seems to work when within  foot of the transmitter
the manual claims it has a range of  feet
remote ir extender cable has nice velcro attachment but signal sends out the bottom requiring it to be attached to an outside glass door of any entertainment centerafter having a great experience with the leap frog extender from terk that truly did have a range of  feet  im very disappointed with jensen
i will be giving them a call tomorrow to give them a chance to at least fix their product or forget it
ill report more when i hear what they have to saythe ir receiver unit the one you point your remote at only has a  ft or so range so you have to place it right by the remote you are holding
i bought one of these at best buy exchaged it and the other one did the same thing
poor design
look elsewherethis was not what i wanted  i was looking for a signal extender for my satellite receiver so i could use the tv in another part of the house
this may be ok for extending the use of a remote control but didnt meet my needswhen the disc is spinning in the dvd player it makes a high pitch noise sound to the speakersi would not recommand this dvd playeri have an apex  and i loved it to this date
but i need a changer
the only apex dvd changer available is a disc one which is the only one changer listed on apexdigitalinccom
yes it plays everything rrw rrw pal  ntsc jpg mp and more
unlike some later apex players that i heard of it doesnt play jpg on dvd only on cd and i guess the same for mp on cd but not on dvd
the two mic karaoke input is a plus
the bad  its noisy
its like playing a vhs or even a mm film
in the worst case you can hear it during quieter moments on movie
if you go near it you just feel ashame of it
while my old apex still playing strong is silence for the same disc
surprisingly the play back of nonideal disc is worse than my old apex
the disc plays smoothly in the old apex without a hint of problem while it jerks all the time in the new apex
the remote is more stylish
but instead of narrow they go wide
yes pretty thin but they opted for  aaa battery
its slightly better than my old apex remote  difficult to use
in a way its more difficult because you now have more function
the range and operating angle of the old remote is not good at all but at least you know the target a little labelled square to aim at
the new one is even worse and they dont tell you where is the bulls eye
i have difficulty using the remote except sitting down on the couch in front of the player
if you eject the tray its very likely that you cannot use the remote to close the tray again because the large tray is blocking everything
i dont really understand
many many years ago the ir remote control signal used to reflect over walls and glass windows at least the sonys are
why after so many years the apex still cant make it right
any other remote control in my living room never miss anythingso i got a sony disc changer
thats the only choice because i need r and rw
its more likely that a person dont have a dvd player than that hisher player doesnt play r  if you have a dvd burner and you dont want to finalize the dvd or never heard of it go for rw
if i really need to watch pal disc i can convert it on my pc and burn
jpg and mp on cd doesnt mean much to me unless it can also play them on dvd
if i want karaoke i have to add a little box with a mixer probably you can build it yourself cheap
if you play karaoke you have to use the  channel sound build in the apex anywaywhat surprised me is that the sony is like a ballerina while the apex changer is like terminator rough
you can open or close the apex tray while the disc is still playing
the advantage is that you can change disc without disrupting play
but its slightly dangerous for tiny fingers because you can touch the spinning disc at high speed can be sharp
the main disadvantage is that you will get lost
for the sony when you open the tray the playing disc will turn to the front ready for taking out
thats the only good reference as you normally dont and wont remember whats the other disc
the apex tries to do everything fast tray close turn disc spin disc but one after the other a bit rough too
the overall response time is rather slow
everything is synchronized in the sony
when the tray begin to close the disc turns gracefully into position before the tray is fully closed
the overall response time is much faster
with the multidisc resume feature you can play each disc in turn where they stopped last time and see whats the disc are
with the apex it takes forever even for  disc only
you use only  button to look at the next disc
for the apex you need to remember to press disc  button disc  button or disc  button
if you want one of the apex changer about to turn up be sure to test drive one and compare to the others
the sony runs a quick setup first time
and also the manual is much better
if you still dont know whats spif pcm raw than the apex is not for you
you never get anything out from them
but somehow apex want to demonstrate their userfriendlyness by calling the dvd menu button dvd digest
but i have to mention that the sony is most sensitive to nonideal disc
for the disc that i mentioned the sony spin it up must have failed some test and refuse to play outright while the disc runs normally on my old apex jerky in the apex changeri forget to add that the apex is thick
if you have a thick home theatre box you may have problem putting the two together in a typical  tv stand
i only have a tiny fraction of an inch left and the apex is directly sitting on top of the theatre boxwhile looking for a replacement for my bang  olufsen beogram  i found this technics turntable
since i have a very nice older pioneer receiver i wanted a turntable that didnt have a preamp built in
so this turntable looked perfect for what i was looking for
once i had it all hooked up i was so excited to listen to my new turntable
i put the needle down the music began
i did not have the music at a very high level but as soon as the music started vibrations came through the platter and made a very very loud humming noise through the needle
while i have only owned a few turntables in my life this is the first time ive ever had this problem
it cant take any vibrations at all you will get a hum
this is a great turntable as long as you are not listening to music loud or if you have speakers that are very far away from the turntable
i owned this player for a total of  seconds before i knew that it was the wrong one for me
i am now going to try out the audiotechnica atpl i hope that one works betteri was hoping to improve reception on a few stations  so i decided to replace the twin lead dipole passive antenna that came with my new tuner with the terk tower
i have the am advantage loop and that works fairly well so i figured this powered antenna would be a lot betterwell bad reasoning
on fm it doesnt work nearly as well as a  piece of plain old wire on any of my radio recievers
in some cases stations that could be tuned reasonably well with nothing at all attached to the fm inputs and no internal antenna could no longer be received with the terk tower attachedthose that could be tuned with the antenna attached had grotesque distortion
this despite turning the gain adjustment dial in either direction
it was functioning as at low levels of gain the station dropped off completely and definitely changed as you moved it
so it wasnt just broken
i could get barely acceptable reception on a few stations with microfine adjustments of the dial
but even at best all stations had all sorts of fuzz and dropouts
you could turn it up enough to swamp the receiver acg circuit but the distortion never goes away as you turn it down the point of losing lock completelyon am it doesnt make it worse but it doesnt help either
on all the weak stations i have tried i simply cant tell the difference in the results
once again fiddling with the gain control changes it but at maximum boost its pretty much what i was getting with the the teeny little loop antenna that bolts to the back of the tuner
at lower gain settings you just cant hear the station at allfor all intents and purposes it just doesnt seem to work  i tried it on  different tunersradios in  different places in my house and in every case it made the fm reception much worse than the stock antennas and am reception no better than the stock or internal antennas
im probably going to break it open and try attaching different lengths of wire in place of the stock antenna and see if that helps
but i get the impression that the booster amplifer just isnt up to the task of passing  mhz and introduces too much distortion at fm freqencies
it almost has to be  because a plain old wire that length is much bettereven though it was pretty inexpensive i was very disappointed with this antenna
youll get far better reception with a bent coat hanger
and thats free with your dry cleaning
addendum  i finally broke my antenna open and now its clear why it doesnt work on am any better than a stock antenna
its because inside the tower for am is a small unamplified loop antenna
its not even connected to the circuitry
which begs the question of why turning the dial affects the am performance
i speculate that the am loop and the fm amplifier are interfering with each other  and that the am is getting into the fm amp causing modulation at the fm subcarrier frequency hence really fuzzy fm reception  and also dragging energy out of the am loop more or less depending on the fm amp setting
btw the fm antenna is a piece of bare copper wire running the length of the antenna
short answer is still the same  its junk dont waste your moneyi saw no increase in signal strength or ability to get stations that i couldnt pick up with just a peice of wire
was very disappointed
have gone back to my piece of wireat least that didnt have to be plugged in to a wall socketmy father has one of these and over the course of a recent move i helped him reinstall his bang  olufsen stereo system
he was getting poor fm reception so i connected his terk antenna but it didnt improve the signal
there was a lot of noise and distortion and the receiver couldnt seem to get a lock on any local stations
i didnt understand the problem and at first blamed the receiver
but i really couldnt believe a  piece of electronics could be that bad even if it was  year oldi moved the antenna same reception
i changed the gain same reception
i unplugged it from the wall same reception
finally i disconnected the antenna entirely from the receiver and the fm didnt get any worse
well that pretty much proves the thing is doing nothing aside from taking up living room space to mewell its my dads antenna and he got it a few years ago so were not getting a refund
i went and bought a simple wire dipola antenna from radio shack for  and at least it worksif you want a noticable improvement in your fm reception buy a good outdoor antenna from a real antenna company like channelmaster or winegard or save some money and buy a dipole indoor antenna for a few dollars
but dont get this terk unless you want static and hiss out of your radiowish i would have read the reviews first
as someone else stated this antenna is worse on fm than a cheap twin wire dipole
a local and powerful fm station that i can get just fine in my basement with a shower radio would not come in on my upstairs stereo with this antenna
waste of moneyive had this antenna actually an older version of this antenna and ive been fighting it for years
i agree with all the one star reviews
maybe ring toss is a great idea
the twire included with most amps is better
i have an rca indoor hd antenna that i hadnt realized does fm
i spit the signal and wow so much better than this or the wirerca ant multidirectional digital flat amplified home theater antenna whitethis one
now im working on amas other reviewers have discussed here this thing is absolutely worthless
junk pure and simplean antistatic spray that specifically says not to use it on screens
what exactly would you use it for theni would recommend the photoamerica alcohol  ammonia free screen cleaning kit
way better producti used this trackball for  years with various pcs and was happy to find it claimed to be compatible with macs
initially it worked but stopped
took it to genius bar and found out it had basically burned out my logic board
very expensive repair when not under warranty
for the record i have  mbp running os x lion
also worth noting that it no longer works on my sony vaio either
buh bye marble mouse
it was a great  yearsi bought this mouse thinking it would eliminate the finger pain i suffer in my left click finger
although the trackball allows you to avoid using your left click finger it causes pain and stiffness in the rest of the fingers because of the poor ergonomic design
i find my self tensing most of my fingers to hold them off the right click button to avoid accidentally right clicking which happens quite often
this is because of its ambidextrous design
this was a waste of money
it may be good for a casual user of mice but not for someone who uses a mouse  hours a day as their profession
ive gone back to using my evoluent mouse which isnt perfect either but causes me much less pain
do not buy this mouse if your rsi problem is in your fingers
i am now looking for a foot pedal mouse insteadlogitech optical marble mouse usbpsthis product is not compatible with mac computers logitechs claim to the contrary
it cannot be programmed to simulate the apple mouses scrolling feature
hence one star butusing it with a windowsbased pc it deserves  stars
i have been using the older ball plus twobutton mouse for  years and was very disappointed that i cannot use the newer fourbutton one with my new imac os  a new driver  called lcc  does not repair that defect nor will logitech reply to comments or complaints in this regardthis is a cheap trackball mouse and not as good as the microsoft trackball mouse that costs much more
the small ball moves too easily and it is hard to be accurate
since it is cheap i didnt bother returning it
i expected more from logitechi got one of these a few years ago and it always seemed like it chattered a bit when changing from stop to play ff etc
so it may have been funky from the start
but now the counter has started losing its place regularly
this is a real drag as i had just finished logging a bunch of tapes for digitizing
now i cant reliably find the stop and start points
generally not happy with sony nonpro products in the last several yearsthis is a decent looking unit for the price but tapetotape record function did not work at all
i will not be replacing it with another of the same fool me twice shame on mealso the operating instructions are incredibly vague  amateurishly composedthank goodness for amazon who offered free return shipping and a full refundi am very unhappy with this product
it was overpriced and poor quality design and instructions
it lack features for a product that costs this much
i rarely purchase sony products because this is usually the case but the only other comparable product had so many poor reviews
i wish i could return iti experienced an issue with my internet connection resetting every  hours ever since i purchased my linksys cable modem
i called my firewall manufacturer sent extremely detailed diagnostic logs and ruled out the firewall as the cause
i then had the cable company check the line and they changed several connectors and removed a splitter to give me a very high signal strength
still the connection reset every  hours
i called linksys technical support and they recommended that i unplug the cable modem for  seconds to clear out all of that bad packets and the that will fix the problem
wrong no change
i got a loaner motorola sb modem from my cable company and my connection did not go down one single time during a day period verified by my firewall and the cable company router
goodby linksys docsis  cable modem
ive switched to a much more reliable and more advanced docsis  motorola sbif you live in colorado dont buy this product
the latest version  will not work with comcast in colorado
version  will work but unfortunately you cant find out the version number until you look at the bottom of the modem
linksys should at least print the version number on the outside of the box
i had to return this modem and purchase a zoom  it works perfectly and its cheaperthey had free support until just very recently
my beef is with the extreme cost of support  a minute
 i dont know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music
you can get  months support for   months for  or  year for 
i can tell you i spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events
i have had my linksys router for  years
i also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldnt go through walls very well
i had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the addressyou will need tech support now and again when you change isps etc  until they change these charges i recommend going elsewherethis  mouse clicks twice when you press the button once and no i didnt set the software to do it
everything else is great but unless you want that dont buy itfirst off i did love this mouse when i first received it but it only lasted a couple months of light use
i was going to get the same one but it now costs 
so i replaced it with a smaller mouse of a different brand which i actually like a whole lot better
this mouse is large and caused bad carpal tunnel too but i didnt know that was the problem until i bought the smaller mouse
i had this same mouse before and it lasted over  years so i am disappointed that this one was so wimpyoh yes and i agree the light is too bright
it hurts the eyes when its darker too so i kept it covered with a clothbrand new but no tone generation
red light flashes upon pickup
 customer service number in manual no good
going back to amazon
too bad
i hate telemarketersthey should take this item off the market
it doesnt do anything but make a tone when you pick up your phone
the unit came dead on arrival
i called the support number for the manufacturer
i told him that it didnt make any tones as described in the manual
he was very unresponsive and said if telemarketers werent calling it must be working
end of conversation
well the calls kept coming in
i called again and spoke to someone else
it was determined that it indeed arrived doa
no offer was made to send it back only to go to the dealer with it
i opened it up and tested the battery
only  volts from the required  volts
off i go to put in another  dollars for a battery
ok now i get the tone
calls keep coming in the thing is a dust collectormaybe people will read this and save money and frustrationlet me see if ive got the scenario rightfor the cost of this item you get to subject every caller not just those pesky telemarketeers to a quotspecial tonequot at the beginning of every conversation
that annoying khz tone the first pitch in that familiar risingthreepitch tone will certainly make friends and family feel special spend an orderofmagnitude more than you need to generate this tone
earlyadopter pricing for this technology disappeared shortly after the last rotary phone went off line enjoy listening to the caller hang up on you
by my math you are still getting interrupted if you answer the phone
since this contraption doesnt work with voice mail because the line must go quotoffhookquot to send the tone you or your answering machine will still need to answer the phone for you to quotzapquot stiffarm your favorite charitable organizations that use predictive dialers to reach their members by phone
if your caller id identifies the caller as an organization you want to talk to you better pull the plug on this device before you pick up the receiverdont get me wrong
i think these borglike telemarketing outfits are amazingly annoying but this thing will not provide you the peace and tranquility youre hoping for
these telemarketing outfits acquire call lists and weed out the disconnected numbers as they go
they may or may not capture this data so you may very well continue to get calls from the same outfits
and rest assured the outfits that supply call lists arent compelled to capture the data
the original data will be sold to another telemarketer and the cycle of calling starts againbottom line dont answer the phone if you dont want to be interrupted
if you mistakingly answer a telemarketing call use that brief time lag between you saying hello and the call tranferring to an available agent to hang up the call
if you choose stay on the line and inform the telemarketer that you dont wish to be called to not call again and to have your number added to the donotcall list although none of this will likely happen per your request as these activities arent typical components of the compensation package of telemarketersso while this may seem like the perfect gift for the holidays consider a gift certificate from amazon instead
better yet buy a phone with a switch for the ringer if you cant supress the povlovian response to lunge for a ringing phonei own a minolta dimage hi
put card in my camera and clicked an image
erased it
there it gives me a crad error
no further tricks worked on it
my camera just wont recognize it
cant even format it
so dimage hi owners beware of this card
even though the minolta compatibilty chart shows this card on their list but i would still recommend everyone to be alert
however a mb lexar media x provided by minolta with the camera works  ok atleast do not buy from ebay or any other site that does not guarantee return shipping
i finally bought a sandisk for xx from costco and it works like a champmonster is a master at bamboozling gullible people into spending wads of money with no scientificaudible justification
audio isnt a religion and these are not holy water
they dont work any better than cheap connectors and they dont work any better than using the posts that come on the back of the receiver to attach your wiresjust gold
why not platinum or astatinewomen think that diamonds are the thing men think its highpriced wire with banana plugs
at least you get to look at the diamondsdayton bactgrb banana plug pair compression typesimply blow these away and they are  the price
plus you can eveen mount the wire from the side
the guy at bb tried to sell me on monsterwire about a year ago and after i chewed him a new one every time i go in there they know not to even ask me if i want to buy some monster garbage
its a shame that the normal joe who isnt even worried about spending  gets bamboozled into spending  times as much as they need to on cablingmy wife called me from best buy and told me the salesmen was trying to sell her a  cable to go with the ps she was buying my nephew i got him on the phone and he knew right away who i was and was like oh its you well ok ill sell her the ar one for im part of the group that has had no luck with these
they worked in the beginningthen something fried inside the subreturned them got new onessame thing happenednow they are unuseable
they start to go when you hear the light cracklingthen it moves into the bass distortion modenow they just hum loudly with intermitent loud crackling
im now shopping for new speaker and when i saw that they were still available i just wanted to see what other folks were saying about themwow im not alone
they look cool but they have a quality issue for surehit or miss i guess a gamble for sureim listening to these now they sound awesome
but give them  mins and they will be emiiting the loudest static that will drive you staticallyinsaneim trying to track down the source of the static seems moving them away from anything electronic helps
 oh well i enjoy them while they work but i fear next time the power goes off thats when the static seems to come back and come back it does with vengeanceupdate these are in a dump somewherethese speakers cause a performance issue in my pc
when they are even in the room performance drops down significantly and many applications will not even work
it fried one of my hard drives
altec says nothing is wrong with them even though they are much farther then  feet away from the hard drives
stay away from them at all costsafter waiting several weeks for the mb sd card to arrive i finally got it
gleefully i inserted it into my compaq ipaqs sd slot and  pffftttttttttt
nothing
nothing at all
i got an error dialog box saying the card was unrecognizable didnt even allow me to format it or anythingi have had no problems with my sandisk mb sd cardi was disappointed that viking would not honor the rebate as they said i did not send the upc code from the package
i felt that i sent all they needed with the amazon bill
i sent the cut out from the wrapping with a upc codei bought this because of a rebate offer
i paid full price printed out the rebate form and waited for my sd card
when i received the card i filled out the rebate form and discovered that they will not mail a rebate to a po box
since i live in a rural area a po box is my only way to receive mail
i wrote a letter of explanation and mailed everything in
no reply of any kind from viking
spend your money elsewherethe sounds are great between snaps crackles and pops
since creative audio hasnt ever replied to my request for a solution i went online and quotsearchedquot under quotsoundblasterquot quotlivequot and quotcracklequot  youll be surprised at the number of hits you have to choose from and explanations ranging from quotpci bus noisequot to quotbusy cpuquot  creative audio said they were working on it june 
they still must be
avoid this board especially with xp or   if you dont believe me do the search on googlecom yourself for the quotcracklequot problem
otherwise expect to get the old vinyl record sound both on pcs and macs and on cds dvds and gamesthis camera 
when it takes a picture it has about a  second delay between when you press the shutter and the picture is actually taken
this means that the camera is not at all useful to take pictures of our  year old son because  seconds later he has already moved on to something else and the picture is a blur
we have lost more pictures because of this cameratonight when trying to take our christmas picture i would press the shutter but no picture was taken
it was as if the camera could not figure out what it had to do
try again same result
repeat nothing
repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat still nothing
when i set the camera down disgusted that it wasnt taking any pictures then flash
 took a nice picture of the pavement
notice that i hadnt pressed the shutter for this picturei am in the market for another digital camera and am likely not going to get a sonythis bag is fairly well made
heres the problem  which has been detailed in numerous other reviews
it is a little too smallit fits the unit barely but forget any accessories such as the usb cable and no way will it hold the bean bag mount
the bean bag is the same size as this carrying bag so it wont fit in itprice a kodak camera bag or a samsonite camcorder bag  for about the same price you get a better bag with more padding and some compartments so you can carry your gps and its accessories and a few other things a digital camera or your wallet or cell phonegarmin deluxe carrying case is big disappointment
way too too small to accommodate anything other than the garmin streetpilot gps navigator
save  and buy a small size sears tool bag
cost  and holds the streetpilot dash mount mandatory option cellphone sunglasses and wallet
plus it reads sears and not garmin aka steal me please
bottom line is the garmin deluxe carrying bag is ok for the nuvi but not the streetpilot and dash mount
ironically as poor as the garmin carrying case is  the opposite is true of the garmin dash mount which cost about the same as the little bag
so forget the bag and spend your money on the garmin dash mount and a  sears small tool bag
the good new is that you will love the dash mount for the garmin streetpilot  stars  diamonds
buy it garmin dash mount through amazon and enjoythe case is too small for the street pilot   when i travel i need the street pilot and the cord to plug into the lighter
also need the sand bag
it wont fit
buy a bigger casethegarmin deluxe carrying case for streetpilot and gpsmap   systemsis barely worth it
everything rattles around inside of this case providing no real protection
any bag would work as well or may be thehard shell gps case for the garmin streetpilot      c i i gps systemswill provide more protectioni fail to understand why a company would market such an exceptionally good navigational assistant garmin  only to offer the poorest possible accessory in which to carry it
i would be ok with purchasing a good aftermarket case for  that filled the basic need of a place to tote your gps and gps accessories but forget this piece of junk
how they can sell a bag that cant even fit the stuff that comes with the unit is truly beyond me
i cant even squeeze my garmin auto power cablespeaker into this dinky thing and nevermind the fm receiver and antenna
in no way do i recommend purchasing this item
i already made a far better carrying case
i took a plastic zipperlock freezer bag threw in an old tshirt for padding and wrote the word garmin on it with a black magic marker
works great and everything fits insideyou can get a much better camera for the same or less money in many cases
my big complaint is the cmos picture quality
its really badthis kit might contain a discontinued k charger and batteries
mine did  this charger is listed to work with the dx and dx
this is incorrect info do not buy you will be returning it or selling it on ebayamazon  you had better correct your error and soon
the dx is coming out and you dont want to be stuck with many angry customersnot mentioned on the box is the fact that this thing only has a  ft cable useless for a desktop computer
it would be real nice if the manf would include this information
im returning it to the store and i wont be looking at another belkintotal garbage
no only this thing is huge bigger than most mp players and it doesnt have a belt clip or anything it sounds awful absolutely horrible
the hiss others complained about is very loud it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises
besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible low dynamics and distorts easily
this is a bad product that should be taken off the market
its not even worth the price here
heck even  would be a waste of money
avoidmy setup is etymotic erp earphones ohms treop mp player running pockettunes vfirst i merely plugged my earphones into the eq and did not connect it to the treo yet
i turned on the eq and immediately heard hiss and a bit of static
if i dropped all the sliders down to the bottom then the hiss and static where gone
if i moved all the sliders to the top then the hiss and static were amplified
i held the eq in the air and moved my arm around it picked up some slight feedback once in a while thus it is poorly insulatedi then connected the eq to my treo and played a few different songs in the genres of techno and rap
i began with all the sliders on the eq at the bottom position and the same for the pockettunes eq sliderswhen the song starts you can no longer notice the hissstatic at all with these slider settings but the moment you move any sliders up then you get hissstatic and sometimes distortion in the song
this means you cannot adjust anything
also in keeping all the sliders at the bottom position there is no volume amplification taking placeafter i disconnected the eq and set it aside i plugged my earphones directly into the treo and selected one of my pockettunes eq presets and appreciated just how wonderful the sound was before i ever got involved with the koss equpdate i just bought the boostaroo revolution amp amazing
see my other review about itcreates high level of hiss
nonlinear distortion noticeable when i want to provide strong signal to improve signalhiss ratiomaybe good if you want to listen ooompa ooompa music but no good for clasicaljust got this device today
i purchased it because my zune does not have eq functionsi used to work in recording studios so my ears are trained i am not only familiar with what all different types of distortions sound like but i also have a pretty good frequency spectrum recognition trained by hours of playing with warble sine wave test tones and various parametric equalizers
this is what i have to say about this unitfirst of the specification of this unit is hz  khz but there is no tolerance indicated db thd etc so this number is pretty much garbage  the center frequencies of the graphic eq are hz for bass khz for mid and khz for treble with all bands adjustable   db
there is no information on the q and bandwidth of the curves applied
the bass and treble bands are likely shelved but i have yet to play any sine wave test tones through this unit so i cannot verify thisthis unit emits a hiss noticeable at approximately khz  khz which is why i suspect the treble eq is shelved this is not all bad or unacceptable for a unit this cheaphowever i am not all that pleased with the choice of center frequency of the bass eq
most pop music sound much punchier with a boost of bass eq centered around hz or so
i am not all that concerned with frequency below hz or so since all earphones by design cannot do an adequate job with bone conduction hearing anyway  bass eq centered at hz is way too high and makes modern pop recording sound bloated without the more satisfying lower notes
it makes a recording sound like those cheap boom boxes  i suspect koss chose this bass band center frequency to cater this device to all cheap headphones on the market as increase of the lower tones will greatly distort headphones that cannot handle that kind of boostso if your expectation is very low and your device does not provide any eq at all like the new zune then this unit will likely satisfy you
however i do not think this device is of any use for devices that already have build in eq functions
there are only  very coarse bands the bass band center frequency is way off for any descent music listening and there is small amount of noise which is the least of the problemsseller shipped the koss eq band stereo equalizer promptlyi inserted this unit between a rode stereo videomic microphone and the line input of my zoom h portable sound recorder
to boost the mike signal by only bout  dba strong hiss  nearly as strong as the signal
 makes the koss completely unusable for this purposesome hiss with a high gain is normal but not with only  db of gainamazon authorized the return promptly and without hasslei purchased this product to use in conjunction with my ipod as i have always felt the itunes eq lacks control
the koss unit had a good range of boost and cut in the three provided bands however it would have been nice if the bass band were centered at a lower frequency
as it is the bass adjustment made the sound very boomy and did not enhance the low bass
this is a minor complaint when compared to the amount of noise this unit generates
the hiss on the output is tremendous it over powers any advantage the eq section provides
i was very disappointing as koss in an excellent name in headphones and has been for years
i returned the unit to amazoncomthis thing kinda stinks
its noisy there is a hiss
i wanted to like it but its really not that good
i recently just threw it awaywe bought this unit a little over a year ago and only used on very infrequent occaisions
i estimate that we used it to play about  or  dvds during this time
anyway last week we began getting  intermitment video pictures that were violet and green tinted rather than full color
this happened using a variety of dvds
then the picture would quotfreezequot and not respond to any remote or direct commands other than cutting the power
the trouble shooting instructions in the manual did not cover any remedy for this condition
we can only add this warning to the other bad reviews and caution buyers to buy alternative manufacturers of dvd playersis your cat a little too short
add another piece of cat to it with this coupler
the price is right and you can buy a lot more of these than any retailer in town
when you need to join two pieces of cat ethernet cable together this is a must
everyone who uses cat can probably use one
i havent tried them out yet but ill edit my review if they turn out to be duds
the alternative is to use up more cat and then have to buy another roll
ill take the coupler
edit  one out of two did not work
buy something elsei purchased this device because of my good luck with keyspan now tripp lite usb to serial dongles and i had just purchased a new windows  laptopthe device consistently crashes windows  with the blue screen of death whenever i stream characters to the device at a high rate at  baud
i dont know what other conditions might cause thisi threw the device in the trashbewarebest regardsbruce d lightnerla jolla californialightnerlightnernetthis thing is junk
most new laptops do not come with a serial port which is necessary to configure networking equipment
well i bought this to solve the problem but it only added to it
i get a blue screen in vista or xp about  minutes of configuring
i though this would be a nice solution but it is not
i am going to buy the ibm one i use to have at my old job
what a piece of junkwhat a pain
after scraping through tripplites site i can find drivers for xp but not  i installed the xp drivers and after  reboots plugandwhat
 the device is recognized but theres no serial port associated with it
this means that software which expects me to specify a serial port cant select this device making it useless
i really like the construction of this device it looks rugged and well built but without some sensible drivers its junki have been a loyal apple user for years but ive finally had enough of their gimmicks used to lure users into buying new computers
it seems every  years or less they come out with a new system that wont work on the computer you already bought
making the computer look like a cute little lamp that has a movable monitor is a good gimmick but what is missing are the basics
there is a major lack of software for this system
there is virtually one file sharing software that works with it called limewire which crashes all the time
kazaa and bearshare dont have mac versions of their software so you basically cant download songs etc
the processors are slowonly  mhzpcs are over twice as fast
for this price you could get a  ghz pc
the price
you could buy a windows machine with  megs of ram for less than the price of this gimmicky clunker
the reason to buy an apple computer now is goneease of use
the new system osx is a nightmare
its not the mac you have grown to love if you have used macs in the past
nobody else uses themthere is little compatibility with the majority of computer users
even microsoft office files dont translate properly on the mac
im talking about the same version number
upgrades to the available software lags way behind pc upgrades
example aol  was the version i used on my mac
all of my friends were using  you couldnt even upgrade on the mac for about   years because only a few people use macs and software companies dont want to support them anymorei cannot believe that anyone would ethically sell outdated charts
avoid unless you find the latest version available
storms and tides change the oceans and new wrecks and hazards may be presentavoid
version update   do not believe reviewers that tell you to keep old charts or old software versions
for your own safety insurance and liability reasons you need the latest charts
there may be an obstruction or security zones added
it is the responsibility and requirement by the coast guard that each boat owner have current charts
notice to mariners and other updates as well  i can tell you that in the coastal waters in florida sometimes the hurricanes cause bottom contour changes that could render you aground  be safethis lens takes forever to focus and i missed many wildlife shots in the field
the image quality is also not very sharp especially when i zoomed in
had to break down and spend k to get a sony mm lens and throw this one awayno amount of fiddling by the most electronically minded people i know could get this thing to work
the power kept shutting off within ten seconds of turning it on
guess ill return it and try paying more for one
i am very discouraged over all the radios vcrs ect i buy at stores because so many are defective in some way
after years of buying stuff from amazon this is the first time ive ever returned anythingthe vcr gives an average quality picture but broke within four months of light use after the  day warranty expired of course
the picture suddenly went bad on one tape and after this other tapes we tried were almost unwatchable
we cleaned it with a cleaning tape etc
but it never worked right after that
we only watched a couple tapes a week with it so its lifetime is about  tapes
you get what you pay for so i guess i shouldnt be suprised by the low qualityi bought this vcr and hooked my cable through it
the picture i got from that was so horrible even after making sure all my cables were good that i didnt even bother trying a tape in it before i returned it
i would not recommend this producti bought two of these
one has been ok but the second one would spit out any tape you fed it
returned it immediately and got another one that did exactly the same thing
by then it was too late to return to the store so its sitting on a shelf as a paperweight
so one of three worked
on another subject the remote is awful  so i use an old tower remote i got at goodwillthis camera is a waste of money
it may have been good when it came out but in  those that are left on the market arent worth it in the mp class
ive had two of them and they both malfunctionedwhile they were working i found they were slow clunky average image quality and battery eaters if you want a mp camera look at the olympus stylus d and the konica minolta dimage z
both of those cameras are far superior to this onei got this product for christmas this year  and have had nothing but trouble
because this is an older device most operating systems do not support it
it would connect to my computer but would not share any data i could not back up my date book or contacts
this is considered a legacy device by palm and is no longer supported you have to pay for customer service from them or plow through the message boards to try to find an answer
the problem with that though is the posts pertaining to this device are so old themselves they wont help youthe item itself i purchased refurbished and it had a new battery in it the battery life was about the only plus
now that i have been using it about a month and it has crashed twice taking all of my data with it the screen is going out
the m does have an sd card slot no larger than gb though is supported but if you cant get your data into your computer you cant back it up to the card so if the battery ever runs completely down on this you lose everything
too much risk for me im sending it backi cant believe palm is still a brand
dont waste your money
i bought this as a gag giftzack morris called  he wants his phone backthis lens does not have an internal motor which is fine
the clarity of the glass sucks when focused manually or with a camera body with its own motor
it has been my only clinker lens
the  version is twice the price but it does autofocus and the focus is much sharper
ive seen this in larger stores for  used
be patient and shopthe only reason i am giving this  start is becuase of amazons poor service otherwise i would give  stars for the product
i placed this order more than  days ago
amazon still has not shipped the item so i cancelled my order and placed it with jr
if amazon did not have the item in stock they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in shippingi picked up this lens today from the post office
where do i start  this lens has paint on it
this lens makes noise
this lens is tight
this lens is dirty
this lens has marks up and down the body frame
i feel as if i purchased this item from value village
seriously
its pointless to mount this lens because its so 
i am so shocked i looked at the review again
i did not see beat up lens in the descriptionlogitech has been excellent in coming out with innovative products
i feel their keyboards and mice combined with their cordless technology is simply second to nonewith their success theyve ventured into coming out with new products such as speakers headsets and unfortunately digital camerasas you can tell from the title of my review i am extremely disappointed with this camera
i actually bought two
and i really want to just chuck them out nowthe webcam quality is so grainy and dark it needs a lot of light to give just marginal picture quality
ive used  different webcams in the past but this by far is the worst
it doesnt even let you manually focus the lens and the picture really looks out of focusfor those hoping to get a decent webcam id recommend the old but fantastic ibm pc camera pro not many webcam these days can boast x ccd not cmosin camera mode the clicksmarts resolution drops automatically to half its webcam size
needless to say if in webcam mode the quality was already bad you can forget about photo and video clip modesi would say the only people who would be able to have some fun with this camera would be kids under the age of also if you are using this as a camera or video make sure you download them quickly into the pc
the slightest knock on the camera would momentarily break the contacts of the batteries causing the camera to lose all its internally stored picturesvideoseven though i bought this camera at a good price i still think its not worth my trouble at alli used this for two months and once i tried using it is  degree weather it stopped working
the pictures are grainy and you cant look at them
this is a good starter but it is better to pony up for more dough and buy a decent camera with a zoom on itthe camera used to work great
i could unplug it from the computer take it out and snap some pix and plug it back in
the computer would detect the camera and download the pix like its supposed to
howver when i tried to do that today it didnt detect the cam at allwhen i looked in the hardware profiles it showed the camera as an unknown usb device instead of what it really is
it was no longer listed under vid capt devices either
i uninstalledreinstalled the software so many times its not even funnyi applied usb patches from microsoft and via but those did no good
now im not sure if there was something wrong with the camera or with my computers usb ports
this camera was the only usb device i had so now i have no way of knowinghowever this machine doesnt take great pix or have good image quality in the first place so i can slam it if i want tohi friendsi purchased this camera from amazon about a month ago
i was planning to use it as webcam but the picture quality is terrible
initially i thought that it must be a problem of some settingsbut after struggling for more then  weeks its now lying in my junk boxrefrain from buying itsachini bought this for my wife
she wanted a little boom boom like daddy
voice coil burned up with a  watt bridged kenwood ampthese only worked for two days
i shouldve expected it since they were on sale for  a piece
dont waste your time with this productas many of the other reviews here have stated the thing falls apart very easily
mine worked until i had to move the tivo
the little hinged door broke right off
now the cable is attached to it with electrical tape
even that doesnt do the trick
ive been shopping for a replacement but tivo only recommends this one or a wireless one that forces me to dumb down my wireless security to wep
grrrrhow could a crappy product like this actually get producedi went through no less than three of these linksys toys trying to connect my second tivo dvr to my wired network  the first one the hinges were broken the second one just didnt work at all and the third one was intermittent
i kept trying them because a my first tivo box was and still is using one of these successfully and b its the one tivo recommendsi finally gave up and bought a netgear usb adapter  it is much more subtantial and worked perfectly plug n playwhen and im sure it will the original one breaks if i accidentally tug on the cable or something silly like that then i will also replace that one with a netgeari cannot recommend this product at allsuddenly i had a need for a wireless print server
after having excellent out of the box experiences with linksys products in the past they got my purchase
reading this keep in mind im a former network admin and have installed many real hp lexmark etc network print servers in the past
it took me a bit more than three hours to finally get this one operatingmost linksys products have good to excellent documentation and a painless configuration  even if you need to change options or have a nonquotlinksysquot network
this is not a typical linksys productthe documentation doesnt properly describe the setup process and the factory configuration
the instructions were written so that if something went wrong the instructions were useless
in order to find out what the factory configuration was you need a nonpostscript printer
chances are when you set this up something will go wrong which makes the documentation less than uselesswhat went wrong for me
first the configuration software did not see the print server either over the wireless connection or plugged into a network cable
it appears to have undocumented compatibility issues with windows xp
in an effort to bypass configuration i tried to determine what the factory configuration was
i could not because i only had a postscript printer
after taking it to another house with a nonpostscript printer i found the default ip address was  which you cant connect to and that it didnt obtain an ip address from my dhcp serverfortunately i also have a windows  computer
the software was able to see the print server from this computer and i managed to configure it to my liking or so i thought
when i installed the print driver software i found that the name i had given the print server didnt matter  it still used the factory name when i quotbrowsedquot for it
the configuration software saw it as my given name and the driver software saw it as the factory name
the disconnect between these pieces of software is just another example of how immature the drivers and firmware areanother example is having to browse to a subdirectory on the cd to install the driver software
the configuration software installed by autoran from the cd
the installation is not integratedonce running it appears to do the job if you like the name linksys gave itbottom lineo compatibility issues with winxp and configuration toolo factory configuration is very difficult to work witho immature installation process of the configuration tool and driverso driver and configuration tool dont quotseequot the same settingso nonpostscript printer highly recommentedo documentation is exceptionally poorit doesnt matter how well a device is designed if someone other than the designer tries to write the user manual
it seems to me that in order to save money linksys had someone in india write a manual thats supposed to be written in english
they could have saved even more money by not including a manual at all and telling you to figure it out on your own
after spending the better part of a year off and on trying to set this print server up i decided to let the dog play with it and buy something else
trust me unless youre a masochist dont waste your time with thisit was advertised as being a decent little print server for the money but i cant for the life of me get it working with a standard laserjet printer
software is riddled with errors lots of error codes and when you can get it to find the print server it cant ever find any attached printers
let me add that the instructions mandate that the printer and the print server need to be hard wired via lan to the router during install a point not advertised
kind of hard when you have a large heavy printer on one end of the house and a router on the opposite side of the house
product itself is crap with more than ten years of networking experience i cant figure it out but the company was great in standing by me and issuing a refund on the order
for that ill definitely order from them again just not this productthe latest firmware version available from linksys for befvp v is dated  dont waste your money and be sure to buy the more recent befvp v latest firmware available dated jan note that v of the router only supports  ipsec sessionsthis product does not support popular ltp or pptp connections but requires specialized ipsec client software to work which is not supplied
it should in theory connect easily to another linksys vpn but connecting to it while traveling is really not an option
the windows  or xp vpn clients cant connect to ittheir advertised windows connection is really only applicable to a fixed ip environment which is very misleadingtech support was not helpful even hanging up on me recommending only to purchase another software client to connect to it that costs more than the router
when i did as recommended they refused to guide me on how to configure this expensive software
i dont recommend this product at all avoid unless you are connecting  linksys vpn boxes to each other
look for a vpn router that either comes with its own client or works with the free windows client otherwise youre spending big money and endless hours of configurationive been using this router for almost  years
recently it just stopped working  i think it finally burned out probably due to all of the heat it generates while running
besides that i found that it was very slow compared with other routers
its vpn implementation works ok but its slow also  i dont know why since its hardware
i replaced it with a netgear fvs i now my vpn connections are about  times faster and my regular web browsing is a lot faster
do yourself a favor get the netgeari was only able to record  discs successfully before the unit began to refuse to finalize discs making them unplayable on any unit including itself claiming the disc held unrecognizable data
phillips customer service could not understand what i was talking about and sent me a firmware upgrade disc which only made matters worse as the disc menu began flashing randomly and incoherently and the unit was unresponsive to commancs
i returned the uniti bought this in march   its july  and it no longer works
i even upgraded the firmware
the only reason i bought this is because i trusted the phillips name and sony did not have a dvd recorder out yet
this will be my last phillips product
very disappointedi bought this in  and it worked for a little over a year though i could never get it to record
i would get repeated error messages in just trying to play dvds
i was about to give it to goodwill and decided to do a firmware update to see if i could salvage it
got error messages
i called phillips
for  they are going to send me a replacement and i am going to ship this one back to them at their expense
in my call i stressed that i had paid over  for this product and that it was a lemon according to amazon reviewsmy recorded dvdr and dvdrws will not play on any of my existing dvd players i contacted philips online and after one month have not got a replythe machine works well when the discs are played in it however if you have thoughts of making copies for your friends forget it
i dont think the limitation of this recorder justifies the price
ps since my last review my machine has completely died
i sent it to philips for repairs but it came back worse than before
please i implore you dont buy this unitfor all the accursed pains youve had to endure using tape you owe it to yourself to join the prison break
i wanted to collect episodes of first person which are only half an hour each
i put a bunch of them on tape then got this and thought id died and gone to heaven
each episode is a separate chapter you can even pick the picture that shows in the index when you go to queue up the recording you can press the record button repeatedly for each m of recording
the unit will turn itself off automatically after that
if you do end up with extra time on the end of the recording its easy to discard itmy only caveats about this are two  the unit itself is slightly cheesoid not what youd expect for a g  i bought some inexpensive dvdrw discs and when i tried to divide a chapter it threw up a disc error
straight recording on those discs has worked fine though and the quality is still greatexciting development i changed the settings to not autoinsert chapters and now when im done putting something on dvd that i got off of tivo i quickly scan through it and find the  or  spots where it returns from commercial and insert chapters so when im rerunning it or sending a copy to a friend you can just hit the next chapter button when a commercial comes up
love this thing
well no more
disc errors were coming up all the time so i sent it in and got it fixed then it worked again for a long time
now all the sudden back to no worky
the biggest nightmare everrecorded audio has frequency change
audio randomly sounds like a tape slowing down and speeding up
chipmunk effect
philips team leader in jamaica admits to problem and says engineers are working on
have ruined about  dvds
wait for conformation of fix before purchase
i will update this if flaw is correctedi blew it in  weeks but i guess thats what i get for buying a cheap sub lol spend the money and buy something elsei got this cheap speaker to replace a polk audio speaker that is out of production
after installing and listening to it it sounds like it comes preblown from the factory
this is the worst idea any speaker company has had
pay a few more bucks and get something that isnt a waste of cash
i wish i could rate this speaker at  starsi was somewhat disappointed in this product due to the fact that it doesnt work with combo devices
in my instance i have an old tvvcr combo
i noticed on my sheet of codes that it didnt offer any codes for combo devices
then i contacted the manufacturer and they said they dont support combo devices with this remote
which i would not mind if they stated on the product description what devices they actually do support and dont support
the attitude of their customer support is that even though their packaging didnt say what type of devices they supported it didnt say that they did support combos
which is just double talk for saying we screwed you and there is nothing you can do about it
sighrca wont ever be getting any more of my moneyit really isnt that good unless all you want is a controller that does basic stuff like turn the volume up and change the channels then i guess its kind of good
not even for that since if you want to change the channels you have to press the channel number you want and wait for it to change automatically in a few seconds as oppose to other controllers where you can press enter after you hit the channel number and it immediately changesanyways i got this and the menu button didnt work on my tv and i tried all the buttons and i couldnt find a button to control to change the width or height of the screen like to change it to full screen native screen widescreen all of that stuff
i couldnt even find a button to change to  channels like video  video   hdmi  to play my xbox  i had to change it from my tv buttons
so its really not great spend  more and just get the philips srp universal  in  remote control which i did after wasting my money on this and it works way much better it has all the functions i needed
this was just a waste of moneythis is waste money i have wasted lot money on reversal remote and they work for a while they give out
this remote i couldnt program it to my toshiba dvd recorder because the code was to new
stick with the unit remote then adding these remotesi bought this remote because i lost the original remote to my rca vcr soon after i bought it the remote was gone and not found ever
the original remote to the vcr was almost identical to this one in appearance
except for the fact that the vcr remote was a full sized remoteso of course i said the same brand look alike its all i need
wrong i followed instruction to the letter how to program it to work with the vcr as it appeared with model number and everythingthe remote did all the basic functions to any vcr
but the vcr was inoperable otherwise
this remote lacks a menu key
that means i couldnt program the vcr set time or even set language at the initial setup
the only vcr features this remote can give you is play rewind forward stop record but apart from that nothing else can be achieved with this useless itemof course hoping that it would work with the rca branded appliances at the time i also had a slightly older rca tv which this remote did not operate at all
i have seen other branded universal remotes that can operate any device manufactured by the same company as long as it was made by the same company
but this remote falls shortdo not buy
any convenience store universal remote control can do what this sucker can do and it costs less
at the end i had to spend thirty five bucks ordering straight from factory the original remote controls for both the tv and the vcr what a ripofflooks is the only useful thing about this remote its cute
use it as another ornament or toss it in the trashthere are some third party drivers for this on the internet for os x but the results are slow must slower than wireless
you can buy a usb to ethernet converter from apple that is fastmy netbooks ethernet port stopped working and it isnt really worth the hassle to send it in
but since i sometimes use the netbook to configure network devices and wanted a way to move large files at a reasonable speed so i needed a hardwired port
i bought one of these after seeing that the overall reviews were good
i should have read further as it was a big disappointment
first the thing is hugeive used a travel mouse in the past that is about the same size
second this device is usb  and finally theres no windows  driver available
i was after much effort able to install it using the vista driver available from belkin
my reward was whopping mbps transfers
i realize that the usb  standard has only been out a scant  years so i guess its unreasonable to expect something would use i then bought a linksys usbm which i received today
the ups driver was barely out of my driveway before i had it installed and testing shows the mbps transfers that im accustomed to with a hardwired network connection
and the linksys is just big enough to hold the connector so it wont take up any room in my bagrunning debian testing with linux kernel  initially connected the adapter and the computer was responding fine
configured it for a static ip under etcnetworkinterfaces and performed an ifup eth
kernel panicked almost immediately
rebooting didnt help and i finally had to pull the device from my server in order for it to boot
if youre using something windowsxp or older you might be able to use this otherwise its a waste of moneythe intel ethernet port on my pce deluxe motherboard died so thought this would give me simple ethernet
installed easily and got me connectivity quickly but i started getting regular about once per day blue screens of death bsod
couldnt decipher the dumps at first but then saw they mostly pointed to sys which is the driver loaded for this system
went to the belkin web site and loaded the latest driver but the blue screens kept happening
finally gave up and switched to an old pcibased ethernet card i was still able to buy
since this device doesnt even claim to work with vista and doesnt work with my fullyupdated xp system im guessing you shouldnt trust their driver developersdont let the ads or products specs fool you
this sound card does not live up to what it promises
usb bandwith does not allow the extigy to live up to the creative standard of its other product lines
while you gain ease of installation and a remote you lose all software eax hd it claims to support it but in fact does not and other features
this product hogs cpu usage because it requires the computer to do most of the processing due to usb limitations
when your computer is doing many things at once audio quality suffers
it claims to support spdif in but in fact only supports it as a standalone
any digital signal passed to the extigy is converted to analog before being transferred to the computer resulting in a significant loss of quality and the impossibility of actual digital recording
i am completely disatisfied with every aspect of this product and am subsequently returning itthe sound was somewhat boomy but if you like a little extra base it was ok  only lasted three months though the frist couple of days they worked fine the sub played descretely through my lfe philips soundcard
after the third day they started sounding distorted when certain sounds were playedeg
the earthlink sign on bell windows bong when a message comes up the subwoofer wasnt playing the low side of the sounds the satalites were and they wernt very good
the bass reflex doesnt play descretely anymore from my philips lfe speaker test it just plays through the front speakershow is that the rear channels played through my two front speakers as well as my left rear
it is not my soundcard because it worked with my other speakers
the wire hook ups with this promedia  are flimsy i never did like contact leads the subwoofer is not well built and the wires flimsy
the places they plug into on the sub are looseyes i did check the wires and they were all connected right its just the contacts on the sub were flimsyunless you want to get rid of some extra cash i would recommend going with a cheaper and better built system
review updatemay  yet a third set of these worthless overrated over priced speakers has gone out six months after my initial review
i will not put up with this
klipsh should be ashamed of themselves
they have just permanantly lost another customer
i will never buy a klipsh product again
anyone saying klipsh speakers are the best on the planet is a  and is in denialive owned these for approximately  years
ive ran the gamut
the first problem youll notice is there is no power switch
these are on all the time sucking your power and have a bright green led that will never go off now unless you plug it in and out each and every single time on a surge strip buried under my desk
no thank you
around  months into use a very annoying high pitched low screeching sound was heard constantly during playback and even if i unplugged the minijack cable
the only solution was to bang it and then it would stop
or unplug it altogether
overall it happens sometimes waking me up in the middle of the night
the sound is muddy and dark
i was basically like a boiling frog
i had no idea how bad the sound quality on these was until i put them side by side my brand new logitech zs
those blow these out of the water
i could not believe the crystal clarity of the zs i was hearing sounds ive never even heard before in my music come forth from these beasts
the bass was punchier the highs cleaner i actually felt like the symbal was being crashed right next to me the snare sizzledi plugged the audio jack back into the klipschs and it felt like day and night
everything just sounds hollowed out and muddier
like i was suddenly slightly deafdo yourself a favor get the zsyou wont be sorrymusic i listen to heavy rock metal electronica trance
but anything sounds great on the logitechs
i mean anythingset up the speakers but no sound from the right speaker
i then called klipsch and they had me connect my earphones to the right speaker and sound came through both earphonesthe tech support individual indicated the amplifier is blown
he stated the speakers probably got banged around in shippingive had these speakers for a few years
they sound absolutely great excellent highs plenty of bass and tons of volume
unfortunately a few months back i noticed that one of my speakers had started cutting out
i crawled under the desk today to check the connections and when i tugged on one of the speaker wires it came right out
i went to push the little springloaded lever on the connector and with very very little pressure it bent in half and then fell apart
please note that there was never any strain on the connector
this thing has been sitting under my desk completely untouched for a couple of years and has only ever been unhooked once since i bought the speakersi would expect a little more durability out of components put into a set of computer speakers that i paid over a hundredandahalf for
from what i have found online it seems there are a huge number of other folks out there having issues with connectors on these speakersthis klipsch promedia  speaker system seemed to be just what i was looking for  a competent modestly priced system for a room i dont use excessively which my main audio system doesnt coveri assembled the system without much effort a good thing since the accompanying instructions were obviously an afterthought
i played a cd for several minutes a demanding art blakey and then tested things with the audio stream from my local pbs station
at that point i was impressed and most pleased
i went off to do something else not involving audiothe trouble started several hours later
i returned to my computer and noticed the led light on the control speaker was out
several attempts to play audio failed
i checked all the connections then unplugged everything and reassembled it
nothingi then went through the instructions including the cursory troubleshooting section hoping to pinpoint something id missed
no luck
then i recalled seeing a fuse port on the rear of the subwoofer nothing about a fuse appeared in the instructions
i unscrewed this and noticed the fuse looked bad
well those things happen
the fellow at radio shack tested with his meter and confirmed that the fuse was dead
he hunted up a pack of replacement fuses
i returned home and installed one of these then tried againafter turning the subwoofer switch to on i heard a poof
this time i didnt even get to hear three minutes of the art and his jazz messengers
at this point i decided id spent more time and effort than this  system was worth
as my old grandpa used to say you get what you pay foroh man how i loved my old klipsch s
i recently got that dylan mono box set and put it through my old s from six years ago and could not have fallen in love any quicker
i went through the whole set of  or so discs in just utter serenity
that was octobernovember of flash forward to february  and my old s officially die
the sub wont work because the din plugin on it with the little metal teeth on the subwoofer look to have been melted it was so warped through all the years of useso what the heck i thought why not just go to bb and get another set of these promedias
i do all kinds of research online about speakers all while having to sit through those terrible builtin computer speakers that sound like a flat tire
ugh
i just lost it trying to find anything better and figured id get past the clarity issues of my old splus the fact that the right speaker never worked at all i sent them to klipsch to fix this issue and what did they do
they kept them for a month didnt change a thing returned them with the same broken right speaker and charged me 
and the fact that they were breaking down for up to  years before they finally really died and just settle for the same old thing
really there is nothing like the awesomeness of my old sso i get the things deal with the snoody bb clerk jerk who gives me the evil eye for not working at bb and having freedom get them in my car get home
i figure nothing could work better than what had worked before rightwrong as it turns out
the subwoofer weighs about a quarter what it used to and the speakers with tweeters n all just grate
i could barely even hear the speakers any more even turning them up full power they were so weak
i also notice that the volume knob is now plastic as is a lot of this set now
they also saved money by not giving you those wires that are detachable from the back of the speakers but instead just run the wires from within them
i think to myself dang they changed all the quality metal components and wires and stuff to cheap plastic to save money and rip me off
i then plugged the s into my computer complete and ready to play and the sound that came out was like that of a dead animal
i remember a happy christmas day in  when i opened these babies upthe original s with the red and blue box that looked so awesome and them weighing so much i was really afraid id drop the woofer on my foot and have to go to the hospital
i remember plugging my original system into my computer and being floored by the utter power of the set you couldnt even turn it to a quarter of the way without annoying people in fact annoying yourself
my old s were so darn powerful that i never felt the need to turn them up beyond the  point either speakers or woofer because they were so loud
there are few computer speakers that contain this kind of substance this kind of quality
most computer speakers are thin things that weigh less than a paperweight and only have a couple watts
this old promedia  had  watts and you could tell
it was probably a hundred too much but i just saved that stored up power until the day i really needed itthe new version of these things is such a jokefakeripoff im so darn mad that they took the quality away but kept the expensive price
these new promedia s with the new crappyboring box the din connector with the yellow tag and without the onoff switch on the woofer should be valued at about twenty to thirty bucks at best in my opinionnow listen im not mad that klipsch felt the need to raise their profit margin which i suppose could be because of the recent recession which probably hit them like everyone else
im mad because i loved my old klipschs i fell in love with so much music on those things loved the sound quality to death
i want my old sound back i want to relive what it was like to hear bringing it all back home on mono for the first time on those awesome speakers again
i want to hear dylans acoustic stuff again like me and him were the only ones in the room
you jerks ill never buy anything klipsch again
i returned the new version of the s in confusion and fear because i had lost my receipt and thought i might actually have to swallow my mistake
luckily for me although people who work at the bb checkout are jerks the return department is usually chill and actually did what they said they would do
how is it i can trust bb more than klipsch
im happy for whoever was satisfied with the new sets i suppose sound and music can be subjective
its just that for me once i got used to the quality of those old  promedia s and how they sounded it became awfully hard for me listen to something else for that priceoh well i guess from now on its m audio av s for mei rated this item with one star due to my liking of a well balanced speakers
this speaker is all boomy and it muddled my jazz music
i cant hear the shaker the sizzling cymbals as clear as before
the wireless also is iffy because it sometimes works and sometimes not
i have to move away my wireless landline to get a clearer sound
i tested this with jazz pop rock acoustics classical london philharmonic and some movies
this only sounds good on movies because of the boomy sounds but sometimes it drowns the voice of the actors
i thought of burning this in for straight  days and nahh i dont have timethere is almost zero soundstage
my creative  speakers  dollar speaker that i bought  years ago produces soundstage better than thisthis would have gotten  stars if the speakers didnt produce a hissing and crackling sound whenever i try to plug it in
i guess i got a bad productagain it is up to you
what i recommend is get  speakers that you think you will like and return those that doesnt meet your liking
what i did after a thorough research of under  dollar  is i bought antec soundscience rockus and this klipscantec soundscience blows me away
this needs to be burnedin for  hours but when it opens up it will bring tears to your eyes
dif you like a boomy speakers then get the klipschfirst a satellite speaker burned out so i paid  for a new one
now the builtin amp burned out
these have been a hassle an embarrassment as a gift and a waste of moneyi find the laudatory reviews here completely incomprehensible
even with the volume on the bass unit at a minimum this system sounds tubby and muddy not only in the lower registers but well up into the midrange
it can sound very nice on material like solo voice nylon string guitar or solo clarinet but as soon as the material contains more voicesinstruments more bass sharper attacks andor more complex dynamics the sound gets horribly smearedthe amps burn out quickly on these
its not even a klipsch amp design they outsourced it to some other company that didnt provide adequate dissipation on one key sport on the main board
its an achilles heel for what would be a great speaker set
klipsch absolutely doesnt care
they will not offer any support of any kindavoid at all costsi was looking to replace a set of yr old  speakers that still sounded great but one speaker would stop working on occasion
the speaker was not blown just a wire would have to be wiggled and played with to get it going againmusic movies and games all sounded great with my old speakers yet i was hoping for even better sound and had always considered klipsch a higher end line
i found the klipsch on sale for  at a local store so i purchased them after reading many reviews both positive and negativefirst thing i noticed out of the box was that these things were extremely light especially the subwoofer
i know with electronics and advancements that lightweight is not necessarily a bad thing but for speakers with magnets etc the promedia just felt off
my old subwoofer is about onequarter the size yet weighs probably  times as much as the klipsch
even the satellites weighed a lot more than the  promedia onesthe construction on the klipsch looked okay but feels very cheap
they are wood but poor quality wood
the screens on the satellites also felt lowend
there is no onoff switch on either the satellites or the subwoofer not a deal breaker to me since i leave mine on all the time but worth noting
lastly the knobs on the satellite felt weak and had way too much play
i use the volume mixer with my computer and with these i think you would have to unless you want to break it right off the speakerbeginning to feel a bit apprehensive i hooked up the new klipsch and kept my old set right next to them
hooking up is fairly simple  connect satellites to sub with red and black wires and connect the funky amp connection similar to a ps mouse connectorthe klipsch satellites sounded pretty good but the subwoofer had very little tight bass response
i played a variety of music through them to get as full of a range as possible
throughout every song the satellites performed well but the sub ruined it
i was not expecting audiophilequality bass response but this thing rolled and flabbed along
not tight and not clean
if you want loud booming hanging bass you may be okay with it
if you are looking for decent somewhat tight and clean response then this will disappointflipping back and forth with the same songs through both the promedia and my ancient speakers the klipsch satellites were a bit better but the subwoofer could not make a scratch
i paid about  for mine way back so i had hoped the promedia would have been at least on par
after all i bought the klipsch to be an upgradehaving read that new speakers sometimes take a little bit to be optimal i continued using both for a little over a week
both were never turned off and kept on during this period
the promedia never got any better
the satellites were decent sounding but the sub was just ruining itthe promedia  set has been sold for about  years
maybe five years ago these things were near the top but not now
they may look the same and have the same name but the materials the construction and the quality appears to be quite different
i have my doubts that the current promedia would last a year so i returned themif you are looking for a mid to highend speaker set then this is not it
i am giving this product  star because while it sounds decent everything else about it leans heavily towards basic lowend
if they were between  and  dollars i would rate them higher
however seeing as they are expensive and supposed to be midhigh end they fall far short
in my opinion klipsch should be embarrassed to have their name on this speaker seti have had these under my desk for several months and the very first time i had to disconnect the speaker wires from the pullpins two tiny springs came flying out
this system is a product liability case waiting to happen
im a former electronic technician and had the right tools including magnetic wand tweezers assorted screw drivers and safety goggles  plus i didnt want to go through the hassle of return shipping and waiting several weeks
after several attempts i was able to put one spring back but then the second one fell into the assembly
i then had to take the back off the system its glued in addition to screws
i had to cut the black sponge of the snap on assembly to retrieve the screw that had gotten stuck
i was then able to place the second screw and reassemble the back plate
even once reassembled i inspected the speaker wire clips and found them to be poorly designed and very poor at attaching the speaker wires
i found only one other review with a spring loss related to the wire clips
very surprising to me given how cheap and poorly designed they seem on my pair of speakers
i cant help but wonder if the company has fixed this on newer releases
a shame if not since otherwise im quite happy
however tonight i came close to just throwing them into the recycle chute and swearing off this brand forever
although they are stars in all categories except construction quality its the construction quality that is a complete fail or pass for the rest of the system
if you havent yet had this problem id suggest using caution when attaching or detaching the speaker wires from the unithad this klipsch for about amonth and noticed the sound lacking in the last week the bass has almost completey gone
the bass speaker rear is very hot to touch though the room temp stays a constant  degree farenhieght
sorry i gave a friend my  regent  i had since   update returned to amazon for replacement now have sub in corner of room beside pc tabletemp  to  degree on top of file cabinet with a small fan for cooling as the amp has no exterenal fins and will get hotperfect setup be extremly careful to not let the din plug on back of sub touch anything a very weak link
thought the sound was great until replacing sound card with creative extreme music card
reminds me of listening to high end stereo systems in the s s may be even better
the bass strong and clean but not overpowering crystal clear highs and exellent midrange from sats
can hear instruments vocals and little nuances i never knew existed in music that ive listened to for years
now own two sets and will be buying another for my cabin
easy fix for power switch buy  christmass tree power switch to plug klipsch into and velcro the extra rocker switch anywhere handy also ebay dealer has improved strong pod din plug fix cheapone dead connection on subwoofer  creating  speaker only systemcable from sound card to controller didnt fit unless forced and if moved a hair you lose sound or get loud reverbalso speakers did not look like the picture on website but some  ugly futuristic attempti bought  sets of klipsch promedia  speakers and wound up returning all  after buying an initial set of them that blew me away with its effortless clear sound reproduction across the audio range and at lowtohigh volumes
the  later sets all exhibited  cycle hum whenever the speaker volume control was turned up above about 
the volume control must be set higher than this to achieve an adequate max
sound level
the hum only occurred while the audio input was attached to computer mac pro
by swapping components with my first set of these speakers which still works great the source of the hum was localized to the bassamplifier unit in each case
powering the speakers and computer from the same grounded ups outlet and inserting a ground loop isolator in the audio input chain did nothing to improve the situation
the initial set of speakers simply has exhibited no issues like this under identical conditions
since  of  systems were completely unacceptable under normal usage conditions i have to give this product low marks overall and for construction quality and sound quality
i wonder if this is why these speakers are now difficult to find newi love the way this system sounds but the quality of important parts stinks
the not so important parts are great such ad the way the system looks and everything is heavy feels sturdythe problem is on the inside electrical componants
i have had  of these systems purchased at est uy
the first system was purchased along with a replacement warranty best investment ever for this product
st one i had lasted  months before the multi pin or din what ever it is cord failed where it plugs into subwooferbefore anyone sayd oh he or his dog must of steppedbumped into it dont bother as it was placed behind my desk plenty of room but no access to do so
i returned it and bes bu promptly replaced it no 
s asked
the nd unit lasted less than  months
this time while playing a video game with the headphones plugged in i heard a horrible screaching sound from the  smaller speakers just before they both went pop
keep in mind i was listening to the system with headphones plugged in so the external speakers were not in use
there was no reason why it should have happened
when i went back to bet by they told me that the warranty i bought from them only covers one relacement
basically i was out of luck but not so fast
i was pissed off that a system that cost so much only lasted a total of  months between  units
my solution was as follows buy a new one then the next day go back and return the broken one and keep the new one
plan sounded pretty good since thier sales records would warrant a return to vendor so it wouldnt cost bb
a dime and i would have a rd shot at getting a good unit
sounds great except this one lasted a whopping  weeks untill smoke started coming out of the subwoofers port
im just glad that i was there when it happened so my house didnt burn down
what more is there to sy but do yourselfyourhousekidswife a favor and dont buy the klipsch as it could lead to dire consequencesavoid at all cost unless your trying to spend alot of money on something that doesnt workleave that up to the usgovernmentunlike some other reviewers my din plug is fine
but after  years everything else is cooked
first the wire clips running off the subwoofer broke
then the subwoofer blew out completely
i replaced the sub but now one of the satellites has  loud static
dont know if i should even bother replacing itupdatei spoke too soon  later in the same day as i wrote the original review the din broke
dont tempt the fates
and dont buy klipsch krapi purchased the dip with the intent of networking  computers so that each could simultaneously access the internet
after spending the better part of a day and talking with dlinks tech support  times i never did get it working properly
i returned it and bought a netgear rp
i figured the netgear couldnt be any worse and was prepared to spend hours trying to make this one work
i removed my linksys plain vanilla hub and connected the netgear rp in its place
guess what
it worked perfectly immediately
no settings to change no software to load i did nothing and it worked perfectly
all  computers could talk to each other and access the web simultaneously buy the netgear rp it works right out of the box no hassles or setupi ordered this memory from amazon after carefully reading the product descriptionit specifically stated that it was not downward compatiblei received  s packetsit is now two months later and i installed it in an emac apple machine running at mhz processor speed and requiring pc sdram memoryit did not worki decided to read the instructions on one of the sealed packets and to my surprise it statedcompatible withmhz bus speed systems with processor speeds of ghz or greaterif processor speed is less than ghz use sthe guy who wrote the beware review was rightunfortunately i did not read it until nownow i am stuck with themi didnt know much about tv tuners when i bought this but i had to learn since i bought thisthis product is for older systems and should be taken off the market cause its not up to the standard we expect today
i should have realized thais cause all the good reviews were from  years ago
tech has changed alot since then
dont be fooled by the price on this its not a good buy if you cant use itpros works with xp but poor video qualityconscould not get this to work with winthe fit was very tight in my pc
had to struggle with it
i even thought i broke something at one pointbut i didntno remote
the specs say it comes with a remote but i did not get oneno supplier service
no help desk
very little info onlinei use win so this is now useless to me
and i cant give it away cause it didnt come with a remote
the first mistake i made was to rush to by this
i should have taken the time to review more productsif all you want to do is use your computer as a tv then my recommendation is to get a usb tv tuner instead make sure its win compatible
if you need video capture functionality then buy a higher end product with online support
apri saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame but im afraid its all true
my brand new simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy within  minutes of popping it in my canon s
i dont care what the explanation is frankly card error is a scary thing to see
magically replacing my trusty if allegedly slower sandisk cards rectifies all problems
i swear i did nothing wrong its idiot proof
this card is just wackysure enough i tried to get away cheap and got bit in the youknowwhere for it
three months after buying it the card is unusable
the lifetime guarantee
you need the original packaging and receipt
i suppose i can only really blame myself for not saving it all but hey it was a well reviewed  card right
so now its a holiday with everyplace closed and i have no flash card
you get what you pay forits very simple everything i have ever owned by simpletech has died on me including this drive  usb sticks  sd cards and  cf card
not one of their products lasted me more than  years and caused me a lot of headachefirst of all you must select an adequate tool for opening the plastic package ie jackhammer cutting torch bolt cutter etc
after extracting it i found a very small operationinstallation manual which appears to be roughly translated from hungarian
i shut down all applications including nortons antivirus and then put the installation cd in the tray and closed the door
upon following the installation directions with great care  times and working around the warning messages my windows xp system displayed i finally got to the point where the last window told me to remove all disks from drives and click on the finish button
i did with expectations of finding a new drive icon displayed in the my computer screen as the manual said should happen
no such luck
but i did then plug the thing in you are warned not to plug it in untill the driver is installed and a pretty little green light came on and the computer made a couple of clunking noises like it does when the camera is hooked up to the usb port but alas no icon and no reading of the memory card
i am told that a crazy person will carefully and repeatedly perform a series of identical steps and then be surprised by identical outcomes
that is what this device caused me to doi shall now proceed to the next level of frustration which i expect to result when i try to get office depot to take this item backone nice thing about it which may justify awarding it that single star is that the uninstall program included on the cd works perfectlythis card reader isnt any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera and was a lot less reliable
we bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with itive had this unit for just a couple of months and now it seriously skips on almost every dvd i play
moving the same dvds to one of my other dvd players produces a perfect experience
like others who have had similar problems i cant take advantage of the day return policy
im just throwing it away and will look for something betteri have to agree with all the negative reviewers on this productand i wish i had read them before buying
i was lured by the price discounted further by an amazon special a year agobut the dvd player skipped and then froze halfway through the first movie and it has rejected other discs all togetherfurthermore the unit does not hook directly to a tv youll need a conversion set from radio shack which completely undermines the enticing value
sure you can get the unit for  plus shipping after a mailin rebate but youll need to spend another  to  for the conversion setall together this product was a complete waste
dont botheri purchased this dvd player as a gift for my daughter
it was very nice looking and compact
after a couple of months she started having problems with it dvds would not load or play at times and then it finally quit working in less than a year
either the one i bought was faulty or it is not a good product not sure which is the casewhen it worked it was ok  decent picturesound and small profile
but most of the time it wouldnt play disks or it would freeze in the middle of them all kinds of playback problems
i eventually stopped using it altogether and its collecting dust in my closet
i would feel too bad trying to pass it off to someone else so i should probably just throw it awayi took a risk with the mixed reviews and the player that arrived today failed to play several disks and would error out shortly after the two times i got it to start playing at all
im returning the unit for a refundokay lets face it
there are probably only about eight people left in the united states who still record tv shows on videotape
im one of them
and my needs are incredibly simple
i just want a videotape that will do three things record images and sounds to the same degree of fidelity as the tv
to work with different videotape players with respect to time counters
to work with different videotape players with respect to the markers that indicate when a new recording beginsafter using old videotapes i decided to buy a slew of new ones and like an idiot i thought sony
how bad could they be
well after trying  of them i can say they can be and are very bad
yes they capture the images and sound reasonably but they fail at  and  above
when played you cant track where you are with a time counter
and they dont register new recording index markspreviously i had used maxell and never had problems
guess ill throw these away and go back to maxellid sincerely suggest you pass on thesethis product was not what i need it i put my handycam in to amazon site to find a head cleaner for it and this product came up when i receive it i need it wasnt for my handycam i contacted amazon they email me a return address lable gave me and address to a drop off box thats minutes away from my office and home when there to find out it was a empty lot
very disappointed in the way i was done with is product it sits on my desk unopen
very very disappointedthis rioriot was a bad choicefirst off the proprietary software puts you at the mercy ofsonic blue for future software updates and support
if thiswas a generic usb disk device any future os that supportsgeneric usb devices could support it
i should have learnedthat lesson from my orphaned riosecond the realjukebox software will attempt to convince youto upgrade to realone
realone wont create mps with greaterthan  kbitsec unless you pay per month to be a realonememberthird the sound quality is terrible
i run windowsxp home and atleast every other file that is transferred to the rioriothas artifacts glitches pops etc which are not apparentwhen playing the mp file on the computer
the beta driverwhich is supposed to fix this problem doesnt
im aboutready to buy the archos insteadalso the first rioriot i received was dead on arrival
thisownership experience is about enough to get me to avoid rioproducts altogetherive rated this before but i really think anyone should know how very very bad the hardware is on this machine
dont do it
go for a zeni have had mine for about a year and a half now
it is reliably unreliable
there are bad sectors on the drive apparently of hitachi manufacture which are uncorrectable and often result in unrecoverable data
the drive seems to panic unpredictably during data transfers clicks thrashes locks up my computer for minutes at a time or until i reboot it even when it is fully powered up and has been connected to the power cable for hours
this is the least reliable hard drive ive ever seeni bought it because it was supposed to be easier to see this drive in linux than the creative or apple mp players
i also liked the idea that you can download the opensource rockbox software to improve the functionality of the player
i wish now that i had just paid the premium for a better designed product
the factors on which i based my purchasing decision are moot if the product itself doesnt work for squat
im staying away from archos from now on and hoping i dont get burned the next time i pick an mp playeri purchased two monster cable mps power centers for our electronics last year
recently the service neutral power line was broken in a storm
the resulting power surge  volts to be precise fried several of our electronic items connected to these power strips
we had other sensitive electronics including a laptop and a pair of samsung tablets plugged into cheaper competing brand surge protectors
nothing else was damagedi wasnt too worried about this because of monsters  protection guarantee
that was a mistake
after calling and speaking with a friendly customer service agent rodrigo chavez i was instructed to email a copy of the invoice where i purchased the power centers
that took a while due to various electronics being fried but i did do so about a week later
mr arturo castro responded quickly with thisthank you for the receipt unfortunately the store factory depot is not listed as an authorized dealer we wont be able to proceed with your warranty claimyou case is canceledwe are sorry for the inconveniencenow no where in the ad for this on amazoncom did they mention that only certain dealers could be used for this warranty to be valid
these were purchased new
the last human being to touch them was someone who worked for monster
luckily for me i live in a country where lies told by corporations are excused by lawyers who politely twist anything to the profit of their corporate mastersbut they do feel really bad about it as they take my money and run
their hearts are heavy with regret because they are sorry for the inconveniencei was very dissappointed in this product from monste
the unit shorted out as soon as i plug it into the outlet
would not buy anotherto give some perspective on monsters campaign a test done in a respected audiophile magazine had a couple of highend audio guys listen to nice speakers through a pair of monster cables and a connection made out of a coathanger
was the difference noticeable
no
they couldnt distinguish
monster charges out the butt for those and theyre sold because the margins best buy makes off of them are insane compared to other electronicsmonster is laughed at around the audiophilevideophile world because if the terribly quality for the high price they offer
the same goes for their power cleaning technology
even if it were good i wouldnt buy this anyway just because of how they treat their customers
monster is one of those companies that cheats you because the environment is right for it
everyones getting nicer home systems and monster saw a whole bunch of tourists entering a shop with no nice sleazy guys sitting there to help youbooupdate   when i wrote this it was 
now its  more
this only strengthens my view that a quality ups is a better solution than a home theater producti liked d bowmans review but he needs to change the word watts to volts ie
most neighborhoods fluctuate   to  volts would be accurate but not watts
watts is how much power you are using like a  watt lightbulb volts is what is comming into your house and varries a little bit over a day based not only on your neighbors usage but yours as well
in the usa most homes get two  volt average circuits which combined make  volts for high power devices
a neighborhood uses thousands of watts
you should not need to be concerned about this to use your stereo or tv
most every consumer product including your hdtv stereo etc is designed to handle this normal variation in voltagenow onto the avs
a psychiatrist did a study by holding a seminar where  of the audience was allowed in free and the other  had to pay  for the advice which was just plain common sense
both groups were then asked to evaluate the seminar after they attended itthose who got it free felt it was ok while those who lost  had much more complimentary reviews like it will be a life changing experience
this is common human nature to believe you did not get ripped off and a key to marketing high profit stereo equipment
ive heard people say that after buying monster cables for  their stereo sounded much more musical
i asked them to define musical and they couldntthe avs  is not a life changing experience but it does lighten your wallet several hundred dollars and you naturally will say its the best power strip you can buy which is probably true
but do you need its abilitywhile the  has some nice bells and whistles and it does stagger the power on sequence of your equipment to prevent startup current surges another feature i like it is overkill for  of all modern equipment
if you own a s  stereo with tube amplifiers then you will probably derive a real benefit from the s ability to regulate voltage
you might even be able to hear iton the other hand if your equipment was made in the past  years take a look at the nameplate data usually stamped where the power cord goes into the device and it will likely say input voltage  or maybe  volts ac  hz if it is meant for international markets like many products these days
if your house outlet is in the  vac range which most are then your equipment will perform exactly as intended without the avs
a  voltmeter can tell you what your voltage ishdtv wont be any better with the avs than without it
your stereo wont be any louder with than without it
youll have a hard time to hear anything more musical like the salesman said you wouldmonster products tend in general to be well made overbuilt cables with great strain reliefs built in and oversized conductors
their equipment is aimed at the true audiophile who has money to burn on a  cable instead of the cheap one that came in the box with his new dvd player
their packaging is advertising how important the product is
they are high profit margin items for stereo stores to sell with a system that has a limited profit margin on the main item
former used car salesman turned stereo experts will tell you how much more musical your system investment will be if you spend another  in cables or  in power strips
of course you cant setup  identical systems in the store to see this for yourself ie
a direct ab comparison like we do in the laboratorymonster products are very nicely made and i do own several of them however i did not pay for mine they were given to my lab and i was paid to evaluate them against other alternatives and comparing a  monster fiber optic cable against a  noname fiber optic cable showed zero difference in connecting an optical digital output to an amplifier
being digital it either works or it does not workthe avs does what it says
most devices sold today however simply dont need itif your equipment can tolerate a wide range of input volatages and you are not having power problems where you live then this is not the solution for you
your hdtv will look better if you spend the money for an avs on a bigger screenif you are having problems with your power get them fixed
i had power problems and contacted my utility provider who fixed their transformer on the pole to get rid of them permanently for free
using a  digital voltmeter i could show the utility that the voltage dropped every day at pm when people cooked dinner below  volts lineneutral at the meter
this was outside of their specification and they were required by law to fix itfor the price of the avs you can buy a comparable computer grade upsapc suarmu v va usb and serial rm u smart ups systemwith similar voltage regulation and it will prevent your stereotv from shutting off and back on  seconds later when the power goes out momentarily during a storm
the avs  cant do that
upss also have surge supression and some simple metering if you want those features
this one is rackmount and will go nicely in a stereo rack and is less expensive than the avs while doing more
the apc ups can make power when there is none the avs can notthe avs is a niche item for people with older equipment that suffers from improper voltage
for most modern systems it is overkill and not needed
it has lots of impressive looking meters but lacks performance for its pricepointin a word no a urlif you can prove otherwise there is a rewardbetteri did the gordon test and the wire failed
failed to warrant  or justify crazy prices
but does cute countok i got to put my  cents in on this product and im truly baffled its still aroundi used to work in a high end audio store in denver co way back in s
monster came in and set up a complete a to b comparison station in our high end audio room
we used yamaha bose infinity and several more i dont even rememberyamaha separates were doing very well for us and our bose s and infinity monitors were good to compare bose was always over equalized so it was much harder
we sat there one day going from  gauge speaker wire to monster and i swear all of us said we heard nothingbut as usual when you tell the customer its there or they believe it then it will be thereour ears were trained after many many long hours of demonstrations and honestly we thought it was a scam back then
boy were we wrong as far as sales go but there is something called the placebo response and thats all i can attribute this product to
if i heard i would believe
none of us heard any significant sound differencebut if it makes you happy why not rightbought to improve picture on ps
cable died after a month and produced a black and white picture
lame
it was cheap thanks to amazon so not a big lossi bought this for my nintendo wii and the connections were so tight when i went to remove the cable it pulled the composite color coded inserts right out of my new tv
why so tight
other cables did not do this to the tv
get something elseas many others have pointed out the connectors on these cables are way too tight
they are so tight in fact that they will actually break your tvs component inputs
this is not a joke not an exaggeration not some crazy conspiracy but is actual fact
i can not believe monster let their turbine connector design out of rd and into the real world when it is so blatantly impossibly overly compressive
i had to use needle nose pliers to spread the connectors wide enough to fit
and finally when i did get the darn things on the tv the component video quality provided by these cables wasnt even better than the original svideo picture
this whole situation was a nightmare from beginning to end
just please dont waste your money or your time or risk damaging your tv
forget these overrated monster cables and find a different manufacturerbuyer beware with this seller to be fair the speaker wire is a good quality but mine arrived as  feet of cable on a  foot spool
i measured this myself and came up  feet short
so if you are expecting or needing  feet you wont get it with this product
the price at  bucks is good if you end up getting a full  feetmy subwoofer had a left and right audio inputs so i bought this cable for a very reasonable price
no point in shelling out any more than  for a cableever
doesnt matter how good the build quality is
as long as it has gold connectors youre good to go
my cables are never going to need superb build quality because theyre never moving
well i moved my subwoofer back a little and it barely hit the wall
one of the connectors broke inside my sub and now it wont work
beware
cheap build qualitymy coolpix  suddenly went dead after  months
this is the first tech product i owned that has ever died on me
i will never buy another nikon product
the picture quality is soso tends to have redeyethis organizer is basically a big pocket with two mesh document holders
the big pocket does not hold my cars manual
could you fit maps in it
probably but who uses maps in these days of gps
the pen slots are annoying and difficult to get pens inout of
the mesh pockets for registration and insurance information at least is useful because it wont cause the ink to stick to a plastic cover
no slots for cards aaa for example
not worth the moneyi got it just as an add on to my order to get free shipping
its terrible
the velcro barely holds the second flap up and every time i make a turn the cds just fly out of it all over the place
do not buyi have a different model kodak camera however they all use the same easyshare software
running windows xp i could not get the software to work properly
after several hours on the phone with kodak tech support they couldnt get it working either
they said they are aware of the problem
it is now several weeks later and they still dont have a fix
they dont really seem to care eitherit might not be a bad idea to consider other brands instead of kodak
since if the software wont work properly then what good is the camerai bought this some time ago and have pretty much regretted it
the olympus d is fine if youre a ebayer who takes occasional pictures of junk you sell but i wouldnt recommend it for pictures of real life and certainly not as a tool to document an expensive vacation
youre kids will hate you for not getting their precious moments on stagereaction time is slow
it has a redeye reduction flash
the delay between that and the real photo is so long half my pictures were of everyone walking awaythe battery also kills me
its fine for about five photos and then blinks out in a few seconds if you dont take a photo fast enough
ok everyone smile
ready
oh sorry the camera turned itself off
stay right where youre at arghdont buy it
this was a good camera  loved it in fact  until i bumped it against a table as i turned to take a picture and the battery compartment lid broke open
it wasnt a big bump either a rather slight bump in fact but must have hit the camera just right
the tiny plastic ridges that keep it closed snapped off making it impossible to close rendering the camera totally useless
if you cant close the battery compartment you cant use the camera
i wrote olympus twice over a year ago but they never responded
too bad up until then i raved about olympus
i since bought a canon a and found it takes way better pics has a ton more features and has been very durablehad it in my hands for a few days im happy it isnt mineits poorly implemented the software is pathetic and the screen looks cheap
not to mention the fact that it is an underdog in a market with thousands of professionallooking titles available for the palm or the pocket pcif you are gonna spend money on a pda youd better consider a palm sonys are cool if you can afford them or the new pocket pcsi recently purchased this item to replace a dying mouse
i am used to using a button mouse for tasks so i thought this would be a suitable replacement
i installed the provided software which is required to customize the programmable buttons and that is where i ran into my problem
without the software the mouse functions normally
however as another reviewer mentioned the provided software caused a delay between clicking the mouse button and the mouse button being recognized as having been clicked
this causes major issues and these two examples demonstrate it  if you wish to highlightselect text you will miss the whole beginning of the selection unless you click wait and then drag to select the rest of the text
 if you wish to drag an icon your computer will not recognize the click until you have already begun dragging instead causing a selection box nearby to be createdso i decided to call kensington technical support and this is where the story really reaches its climax
i am greeted by an outsourced technical rep and i describe how i recently purchased this mouse but that i have a functionality problem
i then provided him with the model and serial number of my mouse
he asks when i purchased it and i told him it was within the last week
he proceeded to tell me that i should just return it
i asked him to repeat that since i was astounded by the prompt direction to return it
he again said i should return it to the vendor
i asked him if he would like to hear the specifics of my problem since all i had said up to that point was that i had an issue with the functionality of the mouse
he told me that he did not want to hear the specifics and that the device must be defective if i just purchased it and it is not working as i expect it to workhence its on its way back and i will never buy again from this company that seems to value its products at a level that does not even warrant listening to technical problems
i guess when you stop providing driver and software updates for a product almost  years ago you shouldnt keep making new ones to sell
i strongly recommend anyone looking for a mouse with programmable buttons stay away from this one
its fine if you just need a basic mouse but the software will cripple it
spend a few extra dollars and buy something that will work better and is supported by the company that makes iti just want to know where i can purchase a memory stick that will work with this camera
ive had it with phoney sonyi brushed off the negative reviews and gave this a shot
though on its way to me i read a staggering amount of bad reviews and experiences across the web
i got worried
it came looked good and i was excited to get it installed
my friend an audio tech did the install
turned it on i thought oh that sounds great
i was not looking for a ghettoblasting sub
this seemed to be perfect
we were both impressed that it didnt need to be pushed to sound good
but after a mere  minutes it just died
perplexed we went over everything with our eyes multimeters and documents
we could not figure out what the heck happened
wiring head unit amp fuses we triple checked it all
i guess the saying you get what you pay for applies here
after my researchfirst hand experience and not to mention the fact infinity does not even try to help you
they know they are peddling junk
im not having this replaced its simply going back and i will never consider infinity for any audio purchases in the future
please steer clear
there are other more reliable options around
i dont know how they are still allowed to sell these with such a high failure rate
these subs are the xbox  of subwoofersthis thing literally died exactly  year from purchase on the day the warranty expiredseems like its a very common issuei loved the sub while it lasted but this is absolutely ridiculousconsider yourself warnedi have to completely alter my initial review
the product is great when it works
mine lasted four months then started working intermittently then started making a hissing noise then it just died
four months of service
that is shabbyok
this thing sounds great but as many others have stated  months after my purchase   month out of warranty it fried
i ignored all the other reviews and thought  they had something wired wrong
etc
not so
im  years old have been installing car stereo systems since  i am an electrical engineer
my system is not state of the art but it consists of all quality components and it is wired solid
the head unit wasnt even turned up
i was talking on the phone and the stereo was turned all the way down i turned my car off  hour later i get in my car turn it on and i hear a loud thud i turn the music up and guess what no bass
the servo light is blinking a slow continuous pattern and no soundi call infinity  harman tech support and explain the situation i added that a search of on the internet indicated i was not alone
the women says email me the receipt and explanation of the problem and i will give it to my manager
we will get back to you within  days
well its been  days and no wordlisten people trust the reviewsnow i read a bunch of reviews about the pioneer ts swx  shallow series preloaded enclosure  and an inexpensive boss audio rm mosfet monoblock power amplifier  all reviews were stellarthey should arrive next week i will update this review with that info in a few monthsin the mean timedont buy this infinity sub you will be sorry
first off still no word from harman customer servicesecond ive been using the pioneer ts swx  shallow series preloaded enclosure  and the boss audio rm mosfet monoblock power amplifier   as a replacement so far great
im glad the infinity bass link blew
this set up was just as easy to install and it sounds way better
the pioneer hits hard and its tightso if you are like me and searching reviews to help figure out what to buy dont buy the bass link but rather purchase the pioneer ts swx  shallow series preloaded enclosure  and an inexpensive boss audio rm mosfet monoblock power amplifier  rock onnote this review is intended to inform readers about my personal research into the reliability of this subwoofer before i would make the purchase
i read all the reviews on amazon and on five different websites that were all selling this product and i found similiar negative reviews on all the websites
sure there were positive reviews but all the negative reviews were too important to simply ignore
i was first considering the infinity basslink watt dual inch powered subwoofer system black but all the bad reviews about early failures and very poor customer support turned me off so instead i bought the much higher rated more reliable and higher poweredpioneer tsswx  flat subwoofer with enclosure  wattsalong the two amazon recommended frequently bought together itemsboss audio rm mosfet monoblock power amplifier with remote subwoofer level controland theboss kit complete  gauge amplifier installation kit
i chose to have it professionally installed in my  honda accord by the best buy geek squad car audio installation team for just 
when i arrived for the appointment they inspected the three items that i had but said that one crucial item was missing for which they charged me an extra 
the missing item was thepac sni adjustable channel line out converterfor which amazon charges only 
so if you purchase this system be sure to include these three extra items
the installation took a little over two hours and the sound is terrific and you cant see any wires
i would highly recommend that you consider a professional installation as the installation is very complicated
the installer told me to give the subwoofer a week or so to breakin and operate it initially at no more than medium volume
after the breakin period he said it was ok to operate at a higher full volume
i am very pleased with this combination and i would highly recommend it to anyone wanting excellent sounding bass that actually vibrates the car at just medium volumes
i cant wait to hear it a full volumethe good ive had an fs  switch that i bought  years ago and it worked wellthe bad the switch went bad and i have been trying to contact netgear because it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty
call netgear on the phone and you wait  minutes
it then sounds like they transfer your call but what happens is you get disconnected
tried this twice from two different phones and the same problem
so i try to email them about the issue
you cannot email them without creating an account
so i create an account get an email from them with the account password but the password does not work i cannot login
i try the chat button on the web site and it does not work
so effectively there is no way to contact these people if you have any issues
if a company cannot provide so simple a function as allowing your customers to contact you then they are not worth doing business with
i will no longer be buying anything from netgearworked just fine for just under  years then found it burned up not kidding this am
smoke smell
opened the case and one of the power supply inductors is melted and the pcb around it black
i had noticed it was quite warm some weeks ago but just thought that was normal
should have replaced it thenit was mounted horizontally on a shelf with a pair of speakers on top so all the vents were perfectly free and open
no dust or anything else i can think of that would cause overheatingi checked the ac adapter and it was putting out v with v ripple very normal for a v dc supply so that wasnt the cause
dont buy it if you want something that lasts or is quality made
if you already have one replace it or keep it away from anything flammabletried this as a cheaper solution for the netgear jgs
did not operate well at all
unit locked up multiple times
would not purchase again
seller was perfect
product arrived as promised
not sellers fault product is horriblei have used this for less than a year and i think i threw my money away
batteries last  minutes tops right now
it has locked on me countless times so while driving i have to manage to remove the batteries place them again and wait for the library to show up this can take as long as  minutes
file transfer is slow no surprise its usb and lately i have been transferring  songs only to have it display  and there is nothing wrong with these songs
i am very dissatisfied with this product hopefully this review will help someone in not buying this overpriced worthless mp player from herethe only reason im giving this product one star is it doesnt work 
i even exchanged it for a second one it still didnt workit is a very cool product but its no good if it dosent workthe problem is windows xp will not allow you to install thejukebox itself
but it will let you install the software
but that doesnt do you any good
i called the manufacturer butthey couldnt tell me anythingi own one of these cameras and it has very low hours on it
the transport mechanism has failed and will not properly load and play tapes
not only that the tapes now appear to be damaged for playback on another machine
i have owned many canon products and have been satisfied with them but this unit at  should be avoidedi love the features and optics of this camera
i love everything about it except that it really doesnt work and their service is terrible
many people posted about the humming sound  i didnt have that problem
but the electrical system was intermittent from the time i got the camera
ive sent it to them three times and each time they repair it or claim to
now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesnt work
so ill have to buy a new camera and hope that you dont make the same mistake i did  go with a different cameragiving my unbiased opinion i am an adult and i know my way around technology
i owned other canon products before from powershot cameras to this zrmc
ive had this since early  and ive used it for many things graduations etc i just recently had problemsfirst good if youre not going for pro quality technically superior lines this and pixels thatthe video is pretty good in my honest opinion
i just used it on a trip to boston and used it for whale watching and i was quite satisfied
the video was clear crisp and colorful
it was cloudy and darker when we were out at sea and the video was still good even after the whale spit out on us yum
the aqaurium was even darker still good
i avg anywhere from hr to hrs on tapes
i read many reviews on the buzzing noise and ive yet to hear it
perhaps i wasnt in a super quiet room but even though my videos had some quiet time in them i really didnt notice
the sound it does record is pretty clear
i bought a dvdr recorder and transfered them immediately over to dvd and they transfer beautifully
it has many features like an adjustment lever by the eye piece to better meet with your eye which is a plus since i have an extended battery and it sticks out a bit more but no struggles with the eyepiece extendedcomfy
you can use the supplied av cables or the not included scable but the supplied av transfers just fine
its been good with power consumption on my extended battery digital concepts lithium bpcl mahand i keep the stock one as back up but ive never had to switch to it yet
the software is pretty straightforward and i do use either the software from my powershot camera or the camcorder to load pics so they are compatible with each other in this case zoombrowser exthe not so bad nowadays with the pixelresolutions quality of the cameras the x is not up to snuff anymore
its better than nothing in a pinch when set to fine quality
i really wouldnt use standard unless you using it for  quick loading pic via internet ie
ebay picsnow the bad
i really am surprised at canons response to this
i began having tape issues which also seems to be a fairly common complain
now i really dont know if this would be a common issue with age and usage with all minidv tape camcorders or just particularly canons but it began asking me to eject tapes more often but i noted it was related to when rewinding
of all my taped it crimpled  and ate  older tapes during fast rewind
in other words press stop then rewind then it seems to be more riskier
however if the tape is playing and i hold my finger on rewind it doesnt have any problems eatcrimping
i contacted canon and they said it may need service
i keep my stuff meticulousthe cost of whatever the probably bs repair is quite high considering it may range from a simple yet    service to a much more costly and not worth the  problem
they did offer me to be a member of the canon loyalty progam which they send you an access code to their loyalty website and basically give you credit and a discount towards other items for your product
think of it as trading in a car for a new one and yes you still do get somewhat of the shaft but if you want to avoid the headaches of selling and getting something for the item then just bite the bullet
i still think if canon had a decent amount of concern regarding this tape issue they would be a little more proactive about it
it just seemed like he was saying an indirect but courteous its old so tough luck
i do note most of my problems have been with the fuji tapes
i just switched to panasonic tapes so its still early but no problems so far using my rewind method
tdk seem to work well with it too but it seems hard to find now
too bad i liked the tdk tapes
anyone else come across another compatible bard lemme know
reading some stuff on this some say it is the type of coating or tape used that may make it more or less compatible but thats internet reading so take it with a grain of saltaccesories aside from the extended lith battery i mentioned i also have crystal optics  lens filter kit uv pl and flourescent filter which i recommend lens filters for any cam for  reasons  and priority god forbid if you dirty or scratch the lens its the filter lens thats much cheaper to replace vs replacing the actual cam lens itself
 it does enhance taping if used correctlyit can minimize glare tone down the brightness if youre taping on a super bright environment or give a more natural look to recording if taping under flourescent lightingi guess im still keeping mine for now
thanks for reading  i hope this helps alot updateok update using the panasonic tapes i think its safe to say the darn thing bit the dust
it gives me the eject warning more than not even though it didnt eat any panasonic tapes yet so at least the pan tapes are better than the fuji in my opinion
its finiky with my playrewind method now tootime to go flash or harddrive cammy now
goodbye minidv rank down to  stars  now what will i do with my well taken care of zri kept it in great shape cosmetically so its a shame to use it as a door stop or throw it at halloween eggershmmmmafter spending several weekends installing amp reinstalling this product on my xp pro box to use with its sister product belkin fd ap i gave up
included cd was flakey  so got new driver from belkin website
installed amp worked  until i rebooted then xp froze up
had to disable an xp service ssdp discovery
after reboot usb device is recognized but offline and cannot bring online
i have extensive experience with networking  years
tech support was of no help
could be an xp problem but note belkin driver is quotunsignedquot
avoid this product for xp until belkin releases a better xp driver
going forward i will be looking for a wireless ethernet bridge possibly linksys wetinstructions are useless  theyre just a description  i spent over  hours with belkin customer service and was completely unable to make the thing functionmy am radio has more sensitivity then this unit
at  feet away from the wap it noticed that there was one but the signal strength was 
at  feet from the wap i was able to get a working signal strength of 
compared to my smc wireless pc card this usb device is useless
so back it goesi bought it for the price it was on sale
i have dsl so the b speed is plenty
worked initially when there was not much security
but the moment you enabled wap etc it worked when the pc was on but lost its settings after a reboot
you have to enter wep keys every time 
tech support  after loooooog waits flounders around abliet very politely
after  calls they escsalated the levels to level  who was supposed to call back with a solution but does not
basically they will drag  delay etc till you give up  tey do not have to honor the lifetime warranty they advertise
also i had xp related problems as did a few others
i have been working on pcs for  yrs and this is a bust
avoid if you want security
if you live in the farm and do not care about neighbors i think it will work provided you do not load the adapter with encryption etci think the product i recieved is a refurbished product
not a brand new product
it is opened from inside and nicely package with plastic from outside
there are some scratches on the modem
i am not happy or satisfy with it
however i have no time to return the product and i will bare with thisi chose this rating because the value of this video light isnt worth the price
at  watts the light is pretty bright but for a over  you might as well buy an adjustable led video light that is much brighter
this light is not much better than the  sony hvl nh w video light
this  watt light gets hot as youd expect since its a old fashioned light bulb burns your hand if your not careful and it sucks up a ton of battery life pretty quickly
it was only after a few months of finding higher quality and brighter led lights for a lower price from overseas that i realized that my mistake in purchasing this product
sony should be ashamed of themselves for selling a product like this for a super high price
yes of course sony charges even higher price for it on their website for over 
for less than this you can get an even brighter led light that uses the same battery as your sony camcorders as this does the lights dont run too hot and the brightness can be adjusted this will even increase your battery life
the battery even lasts longer on the brightest setting than it would on this  watt lighti dont recommend this to anyoneive only had the light for a day and i quickly snapped on the battery and it looks like a great light
but my review is for the bundle dont do it
a the recommended npf is gigantic
as big as the light
it works and probably lasts a long time but its really heavy and seems like overkillb the recommended battery charger does not fit the npf battery
such a hassleyoull either have to return the battery or the charger so i recommend just getting everything individually
the npf seems like it would be fine with this lightapex dvd players are made for the most budget conscious of consumers but my philosophy on buying electronics stands firm if youre going to get one spend a little extra and get a good one
the apex ad is a tough recommendation even at the low pricethe strength of this dvd player is simple it plays dvds
for people who will only watch a dvd occasionally that is not a problem
it offers good picture quality and decent sound quality
surprisingly it plays vcds and mps rather well which means that those burned cds that wont work on your stereo will most likely work here
basically you can expect a minimal level of performance from this particular dvd playerbut the problems with this model are plentiful
the biggest flaw is the design
this dvd player is light and feels cheap
note the absence of a digital display on the player
also repeated pushing of the buttons can result in them falling out so be careful of how hard you press the buttons
worse yet the player is loud and clunky
this clicks hums and rattles all through the movie
it is like a cdrom trying to read the diskhaving said that it is functional is not so true in the long term
as you would expect from a lowerend appliance the apex dvd player will stop working properly after a while
often the picture will freeze while the player tries to read the disk and there are certain dvds that it cannot read at all
this is a big annoyance and a good reason to steer clear of this playerbuying a dvd player is never an easy decision but choosing one strictly for the price is not a good idea
most likely youll spend more having to buy a new one to replace the apex brand when it breaks down
spend a few extra bucks and get a good one instead and avoid the headacheslets start with the defects that may not or may likely exist in other units
first the eject button on the front of the unit only worked half the time
the eject button is poorly designed and hard to push
when it did work the disc holder was very slow to open up
secondly the dvd disks in the unit often vibrated and had to be reseated several times to stop this annoying vibrating sound
now for the design problems
the remote has a power button which does not truely power off the unit
in a dark room the red light always illuminates from the unit which is fine unless you sleep in the room
pushing the power button on the unit does shut it off however it again is a poorly designed push button
dont waste your money on this unit when you can buy a quality unit that actually works flawlessly for  more
what a waste of time this unit was it was obvious that the costs cut in manufacturing result in a unit that is flawed even in its best working state
this is my first negative review
ive bought many electronics and have never seen such poor quality from a manufacturer
this unit also sells at the apex  same unit different numberthe mp and cd playback of this player are great but its main function dvd playback is worthless
i have tried two of these players did an exchange and both have a flaw in which during dvd playback the video constantly fluctuates from bright to dark with increased saturation while dark
i know this is the fault of the player because the menu and quotscreensaverquot modes do not present any fluctuation
also i made sure i was playing region  coded dvds to be certain of compatibilityperhaps the store where i purchased the player received a bum shipment and im not saying you shouldnt try it out yourself
just make sure all the features work before you throw away the receiptthe panasonic players work great when they work good picture most play dvdr discs well too the problem is the cheap spindle motors the one that spins the discthe ho error is the spindle motor not working panasonic has gone from a direct drive motor which has nothing to wear out in their early players to a cheap brush motor in the newer ones
dvds spin too fast for a brush motor the vibration from spinning the unbalanced discs gets dust from the magnets on the brushes and bearings causing premature failure panasonic should have known this
you can buy a new motor for about  if you are brave enough to try to replace it not a very easy task even if you do replace the motor it is still the same cheap brush motor subject to the same problems
be sure to buy a dvd player with a direct drive motor these arent the only players with spindle motor problems
i read somewhere that panasonic has gone back to direct drive motors ive called and emailed them to see if that is true but havent heard back from them yetif you still have a unit that has experienced the h death message call panasonic executive customer relations at  politely but firmly ask them what they are doing about this widespread problem and tell them you would like them to fix your unit at no chargethought another reviewer here was a little sensitive when heshe said the image vibrated around the edges but still stabilized the image when is was engaged
how weird rightwell ill go a step further in my displeasure and say the image in the center was not clearer and there was distracting shimmeringrapid shaking of the field of vision when is was engaged
very odd
returned set immediately
shame as id love a lower x wide field of view and nearfocus is
that works
xis is the keeper for me for birding and general use due to its sizeweight and awesome is abilityim afraid im hooked on the way this works but beware  construction is cheap
i tried two others recently the upscale  microsoft forgot the model  its the one with complaints about the clacky space bar
true
drove me nuts sent it back
the adesso was just too darn stiff
so as far as quietness and usability this is the one i work on best
however that said i took my second one  bought less than five months ago  along to use with my laptop when housesitting and was reasonably careful
did not drop it did not put anything heavy on it
when i got home the s key was nonfunctional
i bought a new one to replace it figuring i could use the box and warranty info to send the busted one back and get a  spare
forget it
the warranty info directs you to the site but after you spend five minutes getting to the right support page you will find that when you try to enter the product name microsoft does not recognize it
it is not a supported product period
in other words if this thing breaks after  days limit of amazons return policy youre stuck
its junk
throw it away
saving up for an applecompared to the other quiet keys and nearly all keyboards the space key which is obviously used very frequently is incredibly clacky
ive found this to be true on multiple ms natural  keyboards in our it dept
its a design flaw and makes the keyboard wholly unusable
i dont want to type on a typewriter all day and thats what it sounds likethis keyboard is defective im not sure if its just the one i got or the model
the keyboard doesnt sit flush on my desk
the keyboard both with the legs extended and flat does not make contact with my desk on the upper right side
this causes the keyboard to move accidently unless im purposefully not pressing forward on the keyboard with my wrists
also the keyboard tends to wobble while tpying enough to the point where its a noticeable annoyancei bought it on a whim from a goldbox offer for  and im going to have to return it im quite disappointedi had one of these and sold it because of the key arrangements that are mentioned in other reviews
if you like swearing a lot then this keyboard is for you
if you are a touch typist then my advice is to stay away from this one and get a pro version
the best advice is to test drive a new ergonomic keyboard at a computer store before buying itthe original i purchase many years ago  i had this keyboard for years
it worked properly for years
it has finally died so i will be replacing it
mine lasted for several years
i think thats a fair lifespanthis one space bar tightsolid on left side barely workedmade slapping sound on right side
what
what im trying to say is that when you press the spacebar with your left thumb the space bar behaved normally and feltsounded consistent with any other key
when you pressed it with your right thumb it was harder to press made an annoying slapping sound and behaved inconsistently
i removed the space bar to try to improve its operation but no diceif it was a cheaply priced keyboard id have given it a better reviewi expect like so many manufactured products today these are being produced at a factory that has less quality in its manufacturing process lower quality materials and less quality control for completed products
i loved my previous microsoft ergo
the slapping sound this one made annoyned me too much so its back in the boxmy experience parallels a previous review
i also used the older microsoft natural keyboard now the natural pro and it relieved my persistent pain
when i accidentally killed my keyboard i ordered the elite model without thinking
within a few days i was desperate enough to go back to a conventional keyboard
the arrangement of the homepage uppage dnenddeleteinsert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays but otherwise it is insane
i never realized how much i use those keys until i was swearing at this keyboard
the arrows keys are nearly impossible to use especially for gaming
unless you truly need the keyboard to fit in a tray please stay away from this annoying frustrating and unusable keyboardi am a programmer and i touch type my code
i navigate through pages of text using only the keyboard
switching to a split keyboard design was not difficult since i touch type anyway
i love the split keyboard part of the designthe old microsoft natural pro keyboard has a great design and works well for me
ive used other split ergonomic keyboards as wellhowever on the natural keyboard elite microsoft has taken the standard arrow key and navigation key clusters and ruined them
the arrow keys are much more difficult to use than the standard welldesigned inverted t layout
while your fingers rested comfortably on the bottom row of arrow keys in the old layout in the new your fingers dont really fit at allyou can only put two fingers on at once and you need to move them in awkward ways to switch to the up and down keys from the left and right keys
ergonomic it is not
aerodynamic maybeafter a short time using this keyboard i certainly feel like throwing it somewhere to find out
also the insert key has been removed entirely from the block above the arrow keys after they pointlessly randomized its layout
insert isnt a superpopular key but i actually use it frequently and my fingers expect the entire block to be in the traditional layoutwhy break the standard
why move the keys around into a less useful layout
if youre like me and you end up typing on lots of different keyboards and you use the arrow keys a lot to navigate it turns out to be quite painful to switch back and forth between the different layouts
and some of the keys i use frequently just arent therebad move microsoft
please dont change things just because you cancanon has not updated the driver so that this camera can be used with windows  a dirty trick against users of this fine camera so that they are forced to buy a new cameraunit is pretty much junk
i guess you get what you pay for
unit often fails to detect large people within  feet of sensor
many failures of receiver at  feet on other side of wood and stucco wall with windows
if you want reliable detection of intruders this is not the unit
save your time and money and find something betterhad to fiddle with it forever finally it randomly started working but it only beeps like half the time you go in front of it i would avoid buying thisi read the description and thought this would be perfect for our needs
after setting it up it didnt sound off for any movement
after several tries it worked twice but then stopped again
i was only a few feet away
i tried at further distances and it still only worked in  of the tests
tried different locations with clear line of vision and also without but it still failed to work properly
i kept trying for a few days and no good
it is pretty rare i receive an item that is this bad but it happened with this thing
this product is not even worth  free
i would rather pay  on something that worksin the past three years ive purchased two of these devices and placed each in the backend of the mailbox to send an alert when the mailman arrives
both quit working in months or less  this with sending a signal only twice a day six days a week
i also find that the volt transmitter battery last just a few months
in my opinion i do not find this device to be very productive or worth the money
try something else or do without since the manufacturer has not created a very reliable and dependable deviceit says  feet
it might work  feet away if you are not going through any walls
do not waist your money on this itemi bought this a few years ago
at times it worked but mostly it gave  false alarms constantly
i bought the reporter more than a year ago and it alarms  of the time and i have not had any false alarms
dont waste your money on this thingcheck it outchamberlain wireless alert system rwari hate it is an understatement
why cant i give it negative stars
the receiver beeped while in the house
we took it outside to mount it and it doesnt work anymore it doesnt pick up vehicles moving towards it or from the side not at  feet not at  feet not at  it is a waste of money
had i known it was as seen on tv i would never have bought itcould not ever get it to set right
the patrol sensor kept blinking and the monitor kept going off
kinda hard to sleep when the alarm is always going off
i guess ya do get what ya pay forfound that the receiver has to be literally adjacent to the sensor to work rendering it useless for any kind of range detectionbought one when i was in the middle of a move
it went off continuously but i waited too long to return it
bought a replacement and it did not work
i do have one that works so for me its been one working unit out of threethe chime unitmotion sensor did not alert properly the light would come on but it would not alert the receiver unless the chime unit was handledthere is no phone number for the product or seller bigflysports
so there is no way to get a replacement or return without going through a rigmarole with amazon
it took up the better part of an afternoon and still i have to go to the post office to mail it backthe unit i got did not match the picture the one sent was tan with driveway patrol on the chime unit you do need a drill and screw driver to install
i wish it wasnt such a gamble to reorder unless you call and complain you basically loose your money if the product is defectivenever worked right out of the box and it would only work up to about  with numerous false alarms
my driveway is  long so it wasnt worth tapingmessing with the sensor since it wouldnt reach the distance i needed
i quit messing with it after the first day and will buy something more robust to replace iti initially installed this at my driveway hoping that it would detect someone entering an area around the garage door and cars parked in front
the range is so short and narrow it will nit detect most of the time at all
i tried to reposition with no success
t salvage the cost i have put near my back door to alert me if someone was standing at the back door
it sorta does that
i am really back to square onei finally recieved my order it took much longer than i was told
i have used several of these units
they have far too many false alarms caused by the sun going behind the clouds and then coming back out
the units definiely need to be installed out of the direct sunlight
i have made a cone over one of the units that is mounted in the sun and it seems to reduce the amount of false alarms
the  volt battery in the transmitter does not seem to last very longi guess it served its purpose at the beginning but just wished it lasted longer
 months and then it started giving false alarms or no alerts at all
you get what you pay for is the bottom linei had to order this item twice since fedex lost the first one from another seller
amazon came to the rescue and gave me a credit which fedex refused to do
the alarm turned out to be a pos with so many false alarms to render it useless
it is not worth sending back so i will toss it
ps
the thing uses  c cells and a  volt batteries which are very expensive
do not waste your money and timepurchased for my business to alert me when i was in the back room and someone opened the door  worked great for the first couple of monthsnow the alarm will not turn off
nothing is effecting the unit motionbatteries lighttempetureor sound but the alarm still will not shut off
is indoors so weather conditions do not apply
placed on floor under a cabinet so bright light does not apply
moved to dark location off the floor where there can be no movementno luck
changed batteriesdid not fix the problem
hid sensor in a drawerturned on receiver placed it in a  drawer in a different roomand the alarm has not stopped and is still going after  minutestotal waste of moneycheaply made has a bit of a delay and is not very accurate in picking up motion
i should have returned it to the seller
besides you can purchase it at a better price at your local home improvement store like a home depot ace hardware or lowesthis alarm had problems from the start
i tried different positionsangles and it would work reliably for a few days and just stop
the outside part always worked because i saw the red light come on everytime i drove or walked past it but the inside part stopped responding i know this because i kept the receiver in my upstairs window because it only seemed to work when it had a direct line of sight and the receiver would light up when it worked
i had this for roughly a month when the receiver completely died
a side note this is very cheaply made
the plastic battery cover on the back of the outdoor part snapped off easily when i changed the batteries i had to use duct tape to keep them in
it is a small investment so take the risk if you want
i would not buy this against off the seller unique imports handled the whole thing fantastic
kyle refunded  was honest about some returns of item
said he would refund  not require me to send back  wait
that being said the outside part showed up with shield knocked off
when i tried to put on  test unit would not work if i was  feet or  feet in front of the sensor
quality was rotton  would not last well outdoorsit should have no stars because it didnt work i would not recomend this to anyone let alone a friend the bunker hill one is alot better onethe thing goes off every minute to two if its sunny for no reason
tried taping over part of the eye like instructions said moving it etc
still does not work right
then in the evening it doesnt go off even when somebody walks right in front of it
junki was very pleased for about  daysabout  am the sender went into alert every  seconds
wrote to bigfly sports via amazon
i wondered why i did not hear back
checking at amazon they did not give this site an accurate email address so my query bounced back
i didnt realize this til the  day return period had passedout  for nothingavoid this product and stay away from big fly sportsif you look at my reviews theyre generally goodflattering
this thing
garbage
i have had it beep or bingbong thrice numerous times in the past ten minutes  because of a mild wind
branches move
its mounted in a driveway ie
where it should be
it goes off  timesdayhowever  when my dodge ram quadcab comes up the driveway nothing
it sometimes works on our toyota rav   we shut it off
its a joke
total waste of money
garbage
  i want something  however  that works
going in the trashjthis is a worthless item
yes it will alarm when you take it out of the box and pass your hand in front of the sensor
but useless as a driveway alert
false alarms no alarm when it should very short distance only and constant battery drainit worked for a couple of weeks and then went bust
i suspected it was too good to be true and it meets all the other one star reviews
i suspect it could be a bot review to give it that many five star reviews
very disappointingbought this to give me a heads up when someone drove or walked into my driveway
it does work however the sensor seems a bit too sensitive
it is either picking up on the small trees blowing in the wind in my neighbors yards or it is picking up on the cars that drive by because the bell goes off every  minutes during the day until about  pm
after that it works whenever someone walks through the driveway or drives upnot sure if there is a way to adjust the sensor ill continue to try and move it around until whatever is causing it to go off so often is no longer in the sight of the sensor but until then ill have to stick with the  star review because frankly i cant turn it on until after  and expect it to work rightupdate cant get it the sensor to work properly
so it is useless
dont waste your money on this product
it goes off even in a room where nothing is moving
this needs to be pulled off of amazonthis bulky pricy palmcompatible model from sony features a builtin thumb keyboard as well as a builtin camera
neither feature is impressive
the keyboard is hard to get used to  it feels unresponsive and stiff compared to the excellent rim blackberrys keyboard and the camera would probably give you  hours of fun before it hits you that youll probably never use it again esp
since this is not a wireless unit where you can email pictures to friends
the weight is tremendous although it does come with decent multimedia functions such as mp
but then again for this price you could get a very good pocket pc with better video and audio functions as well as much much more memory
i just dont think this clie is worth the priceafter owning  palms and one pocket pc  i kept dropping them i bought but deeply regret buying a clie
if you are a heavy user of quottasksquot as i am clies performance is so bad the pda is unusable
when one makes any change in the task change date to quottomorrowquot there is about a  second delay
for all the palms this was instantaneous
change quotpriorityquot same thing
etc
this renders the clie unusablei will not complain about the fact the machine just flat stopped working after a month of use because i sent it in and they fixed it for free and quickly
i pointed out the above problem but they did nothingthis really disappointed me as i had previously thought well of sonyhowever i never received the first radar detection other than driving by someones house who had an alarm system
the patrol cars that i normally meet keep their radar turned on
on my old  year old cobra i always got a detection when i was anywhere in their vicinity
i got nothing on the whistler
the one thing that i liked was the built in compass
it was pretty accurate
i have ordered another cobra and returned the whistleri own this pocket pc for less than two years it already gives up on me
system freezes unusable every time it powers up update the rom and it still wont work
it only works when i reset it
i did regret from buying it ever since i got it
it has little memory storage and eats battery like crazy
no second charger where you can take it with you when travel and no user replaceable battery
in my case i didnt need this replaceable battery thing because it stops working before the battery life stops
only good quality about it is its light weight
i didnt want to criticized but i had enough
people said it has good display and it looks nice
when it compared next to my coworkers hp ipaq this looks like a peace of junk then again i only paid  for it at that timei was pleased with its performance until i realized that toshiba doesnt offer the upgrade to pocket pc   seems like just a ploy for me to sell it and buy the  which is the same machine
needless to say im not happy with toshibas support of this productdespite early fixes from toshiba this pda still has frequent problems with hard resets you lose everything loose batteries you lose everything and no support cannot be upgraded
i am junking mine and moving to any vendor that shows they support their products unlike toshibai read the reviews thought id take a shot
builtin wifi was the seller for megot the unit and despite some of the reviewers luck in using the wireless i found it to be flawless
worked beautifully good range and good strength compared to my notebook computerbattery was the problem though
it started out like the good reviews  lasted a while  hours only used  of it wo wireless and with the wireless going i could surf remotely control my servers or do email and messaging for over  hours and still have battery time left overthen suddenly it would go from full charge to  and give me warnings about imminent data loss
i contacted toshiba tech support who made me jump through some hoops i had already jumped through on my own and they offered to replace the battery
but theyre backordered   weeks minimum wait
the battery issue is a known issue and isnt a guaranteed fix
there is no guaranteed fix for this known issue  so rather than wait to see if the battery fixed the problem im returning the unit before its too lateunit was great but as long as toshiba is pushing things out the door that they know are defective its going to be tough for them to competei ordered the e in august  and i have never been satisfied with it
first i simply cannot get the wireless function to work with my wireless network
i have even tried to get support from toshiba but they just referred me to a rd party sponsored website
there was absolutely no help in setting this up to network
next this puppy loses all memory and documents if you run out of battery power and you can do that very easily especially by mistake
i recently loaded it up with memory for a trip with documents which i needed
the darn thing turned on in my luggage and when i arrived at my meeting i had no documents no power and no way to get them back without syncing to my computer at home
i am fairly sophisticated with electronics and computers but this thing is beyond me
by something else
anythingbuy something else
whenever the batteries lose their charge this unit loses all of its datavisit  and see for yourself
they have a recall notice right on their home page
toshiba states that you can work around the problem by ensuring that your batteries never drain completely not a very helpful tipi read about this recall before ordering the unit and i assumed that it only affected units that had already shipped
bad assumptionupdate we contacted toshiba to have the unit repaired under warranty and they refused to repair it
they said that since our units serial number was not part of the recall they would not repair it
i know what youre thinking  thats so unbelievable that it cant be true but its truewe had to write numerous letters to toshiba executives and wait over  days to finally get the matter resolved
it is now midapril and we still cannot use the unit we purchased in decemberi bought this as a nice small dvd player for a decent price
it worked fine up until about a month ago when it started having small pauses on some movies new discs no scratches and then this week it starts rolling the screen on my tv tried multiple ones
i also had one of their   disc changers that the remote died on for no apparent reason circuit city said it was out of warranty but they gave me one of the single disc changer remotes with limited functionality for freedont buy apex its junki bought this about  months ago
i now have it in mothballs since i started getting the dread no disk message periodicallywhen it works it often sounds like a mack truck but not always
wasnt able to figure out the source of the terrible vibration noiseoverall quality is poor and i would avoid this beastthis hub is not   this is an antiquated hub and will work very slowly if youre doing any data transfer at all
i had transfers completely stop after one minutealso it doesnt come with a power cable although there is a port for power
very cheap linksysavoid and get the belkin port which is powered and without external power not come with the package this unit does not work too well
sorry i bought two for my laptop i do not want to carry another external power adopterfirst its my fault
i did not clearly read the infothis is an outdated usb  hubi never imagined that linksys would still be selling such an outdated and basically useless item
had it been usb  compliante it would be  and a great item
but sadly its not and is so slow even the computer flashed a message suggesting i use a better productwasted my money for this slow hubbe aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc
to this device think againi bought this product thinking it was a good deal and i was short on cash
this thing sucks
it is big loud and a piece of st it is awful
when i play movies it makes a really loud and annoying noise
it takes way to long to load and it gets  starother than the fact that it died after one year it was a pretty good machine
but the price and features dont matter much if it is just a big smoking heap of garbagethe sound from my netbook is very low so bought the headphones to get better reception to hear online videos tv shows etc
can barely hear a thing with them on
totally uselessi havent even used these for a combined total of two hours and the right side is already dead
i get either complete silence or pure static
i didnt lay my head down while using them or anything
even if these had worked as expected they arent very confortable to wear they mash up against the sides of my ears instead of truly fitting over themonly buy these if you dont mind driving down to the post office to return them and your significant other is attracted to cauliflower earsupdateif one of your sides have failed try blasting the volume for a moment
i normally keep my tv volue at about  but jamming it all the way to  forces the bad side of these headphones to start working
after it works then turn volume down to your normal listening level
it still goes bad from time to time but using this method has brought it back to working condition every time so fari was curious as to the low cost
if you like bass i mean head submerged in  of pudding bass then these are for you
if you need these to mix learn parts other than bass or listen to symphony you will be very sadi did research on headphones within my price range and i found the sennheiser products were among the best based on numerous reviews on numerous sites
unfortunately although the price of this particular headphone set was nice  that was all that was nice about these
the sound quality was fair for the price
i had utilized my computers sound settings to try to lessen the crackles and pops that i originally experienced with the headphones not extreme  but bothersome and told myself  hey you get what you pay for
what was really horrible was the quality of the product
only a few months after purchase the right side completely lost sound
come on  only a few months after purchase
i took the headphones apart and found the casing had come off the wires which also showed me that the wires themselves had detached
there was string that was wrapped around the wires which fed into the headphones
you couldnt tell this by looking at them intact  only if you took it apart
in addition these are not comfortable at all
i was seeking the padding for the ears and top of head for comfort  which it has the padding  not the comfort
and the fact that i do not have that large of a head any inexpensive type headphones will fall right off my head if i lean forward really floored me in regards to these particular headphones
these literally squished my head and ears
i could only tolerate them for a short time and would have to take them off
they hurt
bottom line is this particular set of headphones is extremely poor quality merchandise
do not buyi am a hugh fan of sennheiser products i own  other products and love them both for sound quality and durability
avoid these i gave these to my father who lives in a nursing home and has a roommate
with my last visit recently i noticed he wasnt wearinghis new headphones and then i found out why
the cord where it split was not allowing a constant feed of sound and was like listening to snap crackle and pop just needed some milk plus the ear cups just came apart and my father is not the type to do sit upsand push ups while listening to zz top
just sits in his lift chair and watches tv for most of the day
these are cheap and i suggest avoiding them
ive mailed them back to amazon for credit
my father is now trying the koss ur home headphones and so fari know their working since he never picks up the phone except the remote but i know hes happy
ill keep you posted with thesefor what they are these are good headphones at a good price because they are being discontinued soon
but i cant stand them
i find them uncomfortable and disorienting because they close out all outside sounds and form an airtight seal around my ears
in addition they crush my head and after a short time i have to take them off and throw them across the room
but if you like over the ear headphones these are certainly a good deal and sound finei tried using them with a mic playing left  dead  on my computer and it was very disorienting as you cant hear your own voice
so that was a bust as welli have a pair of sennheiser active noise canceling supraaural headphones and i find them more comfortable lighter and generally more pleasant to use but those arent for everyone either
some people cant wear those noise canceling cans they can give you vertigo in rare instances
i picked the hd  for my teenage son and he couldnt stand them for the same reasons i cant which is why i ended up with them
but i wont use them either
in the end i use some cheap over the ear clip on things i found at tj max one lucky day
they are light you can hear the wife asking you a question and you can put a quality usb headset over them to talk in ld if necessaryas another reviewer stated one of the wires came out of the earcup and no longer functionsthis was after  months of nominal intermittent usage   year warranty who sends a  set of headphones out for repair
im going to avoid the brand just for this reason im sure higher end stuff is fine but i had a set of sony earbuds that i beat on for years before this happened 
not sure where to nextthese are very tightfitting and would fit a small head well
these were tried on and put right back in the package without even hearing how they sounded
the padding is also unusually stiff and uncomfortable
i returned them to amazon and purchased a pair of jvc hax earphones
the jvcs are phenomenal and cost lesshighly recommendedthe pain of ownershipi am so disappointed with these headphones because i bought them after reading the ridiculously positive reviews here on amazontheyre like a medieval torture device on my head they hurt so bad
im not a big guy lbs and i dont have a freakishly large headi keep bending the headphones outward to the point of almost breaking them in the hopes of loosening the grip of this headphone vice but it only works for a few seconds
i found that cupping my earlobe inside the headphone helps me wear them for an extra minute before my ears get sore and my head achesphotos show inconsistencies in manufacturingive used other cheap headphones with no problems i think its the thick hard plastic they used in the head band that prevents it from easily bending to the shape of a persons head
unlike the stock photo in this amazon post when my headphones are lying on the table without someones head being crushed between them they lay there at rest with the ear pieces touching each other  there is no space between them like in the photo
i uploaded a picture of my headphones you must click on see all customer images below the photo
mine was taken on the granite counter top and you will notice these headphones were manufactured differently from the other photos
guess its a crapshoot as to which version you will get the regularmansize or yearoldgirl sizethe soundas for p allen comparing them to expensive headphones i think its fair
everyone here is posting how incredibly awesome the sound is and i too think theyre just happy to have bass blasting in their ears even when most music wasnt meant to sound this way
the sound is better than average in this price range but the pain is too much for me to bearreason for stari give this product star because sennheiser did not list a minimum headsize requirement and their manufacturing process is not consistent
if you have a big brain like i do definitely skip this product or be prepared to return it if you get the circleshaped one like i didthinking they are a great value i bought  of these to give as christmas gifts to people at work and a colleague did the same thing
in all respects these were just average a bit heavy and warm but well worth the money at first
however all  had the cord break at the right earpiece within  months
as they are used by different people some of which are very careful with their stuff this is not because they are handled roughly
they were however used for several hours  days a weekwhen amazoncom sent me these headphones i discovered that they are not headphones but actually a machine for making white noise
they do play some sound but they also take whatever hiss there was on the audio track and they amplify it drastically
not only that but the hiss amplification is strangely correlated with the pitch of the sound
imagine a movie character talking  with natural variations in voice pitch the hiss would increase or decrease thus creating a whole new hiss track to the movie
do not purchase these flawed headphoneshissing devicesound is pretty good and if you have a small head you can ignore the cheap plastic construction
if you are an adult with a normal head size forget itanother headphone into the garbage
this happens to me quite often
im pretty sure its a failure due to the connection at the ear peace
why not make a sturdy headpiece connectionps
if the headphones fail at the jack that connect to your mp player it can be repaired by cutting the wire and replacing the jack with something betteri bought this head phones by looking at  plus positive reviews and ignoring negative reviews
but i am very disappointed with my decision
these are very tight on my ears
i cant wear them even for  minutes with out paining my earsi bought these pair of headphones because of the  reviews that largely say positive things about the sound quality
i agree with those reviews  the sound is balanced slightly weighted towards the bass and low frequencies
however i returned these headphones within a couple weeks of using them because i developed blisters below both my ears  where the headphone rests on the headi dont have a large head by any standards
however these headphones are incredibly tightfitting
the cushioning is just not enough to offset the crushing effect that these headphones have on your ears and head
the cushioning foams are not deep enough and your ear lobes will hit the hard part of the headphone inside
this hard surface usually also has cushions in other brands such as koss however there is none in sennheiser hd sif you wear headphones for a couple hours in a day perhaps they might be okay
however if you are getting the sennheiser hd s for extended wearing  hours at a stretch be prepared to face some pressure pain or blisters like me
i sincerely hope that the sennheiser folks are seeing these reviews  delivering sound quality is just not enough if you make them so tight that they hurt like hell after a whileamazon was very gracious about the return and refunded me promptlythese are the most uncomfortable headphones i have ever used
i wanted a not too expensive pair for monitoring with my turntablepreamp setup with my computer
i consider myself an audiophile but did not want expensive headphones for this purpose
with all the great reviews i didnt even save the packaging
i will write a letter to sennheiser
i get a headache wearing these
totally uncomfortable
would get  stars if i could rate them that lowno matter how i adjusted these headphones they are tight which wouldnt be so bad if the they went around the ear but they hit me on the earif you have a small head and ears i guess these might be alright
can stand to wear them long enough to find outhopefully amazon has fixed this problem by now but from the most recent review i doubt it
i ordered these headphones and actually received the hmd the same headphone but with a microphone
i might have been able to just deal with it even though i didnt want the microphone or extra weight but theyre sending the unterminated model with bare wires that requires you to put your own plug on
its probably great for djs who want a headset and mic and want to make sure the plug matches their equipment but for listeners trying to order the hd its no good
im especially irritated because i bought an amazon prime membership and now im going to have to pay for shipping anyway to get these someplace else because amazon apparently hasnt corrected the problem
i returned my headphones and was refunded by amazon already so this shouldnt be news to them
caveat emptorfirst off i dont have a bigsmall head
i like to think of myself as fairly average in the head size department
im not an audiophile but i listen to music  hours a day at work
i used to have a bose set that i loved and broke after about  years
the problems with these are they are too damm heavy
it really does feel like wearing a helmet
im sure with minor modifications these could be dot approved for motorcycle riders
wearing these for hours at work is really not an option they are too damm tight
i opened up up completely
but they still press hard against my head
and now because they are opened up all the way  looks like i have rabbit ears because of the fit they create crazy pressure
the sound i guess it pretty good but the pressure it creates feels like you are listening to music while scuba divingafter buying s of items based on amazon reviewers the is literally the worst inspite of  star reviews
i hate these headphone hate em even more than oatmealthe sound quality was fine but they are built for people with very small heads
its just a poor design
the first pair started to fall apart and i used duct tape to keep them together as long as i could
why i bought a second pair i can not say i guess i liked the sound quality
the second pair quickly fell apart alsoafter the second pair fell apart on me i finally woke up and bought a pair of hd s
by this point in time ive been using them longer than both pairs of the s combined yet they are just like new showing absolutely no signs of wear and the sound is better to boot
none of the problems i had with the si love my hd si have a mediumlarge head and these squeeze my head way too much
my wifes head is very small and they do the same to her
they are also very bulky massive headphones
the material they are made of is very noise so if im moving my mouth at all chewing talking moving at all the padding is really noisy against my skin so much so that i can hear it in the microphone if recording voice overs
i met a sound guy who said he owned a pair and got angry every time he saw those headphones
i feel the same way
unbearablei ordered a pair of these headphones after reading numerous reviews about how comfortable and great sounding they were
unfortunately one channel was dead no matter what source i plugged them into
i also was shocked at how stiff and uncomfortable the ear cushions were
my sony mdr s actually feel better i doubt i would have kept the sennheisers even if they worked
zzounds did send me a freepostage return label but it was close to a month that they sat on my i bought this headphone for use with my desktop and laptopcomputers
i thought for a  headphone the least ican expect is a clear sound
but to my surprise the soundquality is horrible this is definitely not a  headphone
in fact i wouldnt spend more than  for this kindof quality
stay away from this head phone unless you likewasting your moneysomeone and i believe it to be sony music really crippled this little guy
netmd could have been real cool but its nothing but a hassle
its no wonder md didnt catch on even with the introduction of netmd
first openmg is simply horrible
you have to check out the music files that you copy to it and you only get  check outs
to delete a file off the md you have to check in the track
you cant just drag amp drop mp files individually either you have to set up a whole quotplaylistquot
not to mention openmg is buggy and crashes  through the transfer
i downloaded sonicstage  openmgs replacement and its still as crippled and bloated with the same check incheck out rules and stupid playlists
i dont know why i cant just drag amp drop mps to the md
if the terrible software werent bad enough all mps wavs etc
are converted to lp atrac files so your hard drive space gets wasted
that also means if you copy mps to the md in sp mode what youre getting is just lp converted to pcm then the n itself reconverts the pcm to atrac
netmd is hardly worthwhile compared to realtime recording via spdif
about the only thing netmd is good for is editing track titles from the pcthe good here and there is good is a well made bit of hardware with excellent sound long battery life compact size etc
i didnt even mind sonys digital rights management designed to ensure you dont go into production of md discs full of other peoples musicthe bad is that while the device is fairly well optimized for ripping cds and at that the drm isnt a hinderance to anyone making copies for all their friend as opposed to all of the east coast
but its huge hinderance for field recording a perfectly legal pursuit
i can download your music from cd at up to x over usb or via optical toslink in realtime but i cant upload my recording digitally to a pc
period
only output is analogthe ugly is that you are intentionally deceived
none of the md players support anything but atrac or atrac ondisc
the drm software has to convert mp or wma files to atracatrac for download dropping in quality vs pure mp
the current version of their drm doesnt support vbr mps period and seems to choke on most  id tags
so even in transcoding its not mp compliant vbr is a requirement of the mp spec and supported on virtually any player youll find
your hour playing time is only by way of lp which is kbs atrac
maybe not as cheesy and full of artifacts as wma but questionable for musici hate being told what i can and cant do with products i buy
if i want to buy expensive electronics for use as a doorstop then thats my choice
but sony in their zeal to be all things to no people has created this travesty of a product
despite what the package lingo says you cannot play mp or wav files
they get converted to sonys proprietary and much clunkier format
furthermore the openmg software provided by sony for this purpuse stinks
it is the only piece of software that has every caused a blue screen of death on my windows xp laptop and its a vaio
if sony cant get their software to play nice on their own products how do you expect it to work with anything else
the interface is clunky to say the least the conversion is slow the instructions pitiful and the feedback from both the unit and the software is so awful that you have to wonder if a first grade student who spoke no english wrote the interface
its almost impossible for me to say anything positive about this product because it was so bad
it took me over an hour to install the software and another  hours removing it and cleaning up after it
it leaves stuff littered all over your hard drive
not to mention that now that ive uninstalled it my quicktime wont work anymore
dont buy any sony portable products unless its a tape player or a cd player and ill bet you that with their cd players theyre going to start putting in stuff to protect their precious record catalog
imagine not being able to play cdrs
impossible you say
just watch
ill bet you its coming and ill bet you sony starts itprosive had two garmin s and one garmin  for years
my family uses them all the time when were out riding our bikes
i especially like them at amusement parks because we sometimes split up and over reasonable distances can use them to communicate and find each other
i believe garmin holds the patent for transmitting locational information in the way that they do for these types of radios
very handyconson the other hand i think there are two main design problems
the minor one is that the battery compartment spring connectors wiggle loose over time and with no capacitor to ride through a millisecond of loss of power the units simply crash or die
the more major problem is that the only way to update these rinos maps software updates etc
is through an old obsolete db serial cable
no modern computer even comes with serial connectors anymore
seriously garmin youve already gotten a huge return on investment in your design that is well over a decade old now  cant you even see your way clear to refresh the computer interface so that your customers can download maps which you also sell on a modern computer
note the more modernexpensive rino models do have better interfaces but the low end models are stuck in the past with an unusable connector
if you have to have a rino get a different model
i love the concept but i cant recommend any product that can no longer communicate
it would be like asking someone to recommend an old analog ntsc tv set
just say nothese radios are really horrible
we use them hunting in northern michigan and the range in the longrange channels is pathetic and worthless
they are frustrating and not worth the bother
plus they chew through batteries very quick  less than  hours of use is what we experiencedthat retractable cord is just phenomenal
unfortunately its connected to this garbage kensington mouse
after a few hours of use the optical hardware started flickering and eventually it just shut off
i can still make it light up once in a while but never long enough to use it to navigate kensingtons website and tell them to get their act together
if yours isnt broken yet then congrats for now
at least in a pinch i can still use the cord retractor on mine to make a batmanesque escape
right idea wrong mousecompanythese were the worst quality ive seen from plantronics
the cord and volume switch are thin and flimsy and the sound quality of the mic is fair at bestdont waste your  get a better headset
youll be happier in the long runsave your money
ive been through  plantronics headsets over the past year
they are quotveryquot easy to breaktwo wires lead to the headset one of which transmits sound from the microphone to the computer the other transmits sound from the computer to your earphones
unfortunately these are stuck together and are only allowed to travel separately for the last three inches or so
this means that your mic in jack and your headphone out jack must be adjacent or these wont work for you
if like many people your computer and the microphone in is under the desk and your speakers with the headphone outs are on top of the desk then you will have to return this itemive owned this player for at least four years
and although i havent used it for awhile perhaps six months i didnt leave it plugged in and i dont use batteries
so when i plugged in in today i fully expected it to run
it hadnt been dropped drenched or otherwise abused it had just been left hanging on the rail of my treadmill
and the thing wont work
itll indicate a track for a disc but then shut down
no sound no anything
i was going to listen to some jazz while on the treadmill but now i have to get a new cd player
bummeri have a celestron firstscope and a canon rebel slr
when using this adapter i cannot focus the telescope
i guess it is because of the length of the adapter
by the way due to the fact that you will be using the native magnification of the telescope it is much better to buy a barlow tadapterthere is more to this product and you need to investigate it before buying
purchased this and a canon d adapter to shoot using a telescope
i could not get this product to work properly and called a good resource for advice
after an hour of technical discussion we determined it would not function with my systemso it sits in the purchased but does not work pilepoor performance does not help much for astrophotography really not  advised to buy the price is too high for the benefit that can be obtained with usebought it to listen to mp files i have
cant because of the bad sony software that comes with it
ok ok actually i could if i burn a cd first of what i want then transfer that to minidisc  to load a blank minidisc with about   hours of music took about a hour total
this involved using the sony clunky software to get a playlist convert said list to the minidisc file format transfer files to minidisc
the conversion from mp to the sony format took about  minutes and the transfer to the minidisc at least  minutes
this was on a pretty zippy p gig machine
irked me a little at the time involved but could live with it then i found out you can only do this  times after that you have to reconvert the song again
this is sony trying to stop song piracyfrankly i dont give a whoop about sony losing a dime from piracy and think they have ruined what is a great hardware product with absolutely terrible software
as seems the case with most sony items i have they like to add about  steps more than are needed
sooo i have returned this player to buy a rio mp player instead
so far that the rio is great and had it up and running in  minutes when the sony took almost  hourscan not recommend this item for mp for straight cd to minidisc it is okbut why not get a regular mp player instead and have more flexible productdo not buy a magnavox universal remote for your dvd playerbuy a more reliable brand
seriously you will be sorry you bought thisin fact eventually youll feel like smashing this piece of  into piecestry ordering the actual remote made for your dvd player from its manufacturerthey might work fine for a tv or vcr
but for a dvd playerthe menu function is a shoddy inoperable unreliable waste of moneyif you enjoy sitting there pressing the menu function over  over forseveral minutes trying to set up your program only to realize that theremote wont select some dvd setups then hey buy iti purchased an openbox sony dvd player at best buy marked downbecause there was no remote
so i bought this magnavox universal remoteit works fine for basic functions stop play pause etcbut for choosing setup functions or episodes on a dvd it is horrendousthe magnavox remote for most dvds to choose a setup widescreen or tv aspect sizeor to choose an episode of a tv show dvd you must bypass the main menuscreen by pressing all the buttons to start playing the program
then after it starts playingyou have to press the menu button again until you get back to the main menu screenthen choose your setup chapter or episode then press the play button until it plays againthe magnavox universal remote is especially frustrating for  dvds where you have to choose widescreen or regular aspect at the beginningof the disc
most dvds have the widescreen on one side so those are not a problembut there are some that require you to choose the aspect size on the dvd screenyou have to just play the default choice that it lands on usually the small   size
this remote simply cannot choose the second option no matter howmany times you play with it the aspect menu comes on so fast when you put thedisc in it doesnt give the remote a chance to activate so on the few dvds thatrequire this choice you may have to watch a movie in the small cropped tv size
tv show dvds if you try to choose an episode other than the first one on the discwhen you first put the dvd in it wont let you pick an episode
and you know howlong it takes to start watching a tv episode on dvd  you have to go through  or  menuscreens before starting the show episode index episode description page play episodeor recap page etc
with magnavox remote you have to do all of that twice
supposeyou put the dvd in but you want to watch the third episode on the disc
sorry
cant do ityou have to start playing the first episode then when it begins you have to press themenu button a few times again back to the episode list page then choose another episodethen go through the index description play episode etc
all over again then play ita year after i bought this remote the pharmacy had a rebate on a new magnavox remotewith the flip handle design it was free after the rebate so i bought it
i have the same problemwith the newer remote it cant grab certain menu functions to set up or play dvdsim not exaggerating
magnavox universal remotes suck on dvd playerscontrary to its claims this remote does not retain settings when you change batteries
not even for  seconds
that means that youll will need to reprogram the whole thing every time when you change batteries
this is a ridiculous flaw
i would absolutely not have bought it if i had known this
the remote is simple and works but a flaw like that makes it crippled
i dont know how long the batteries are going to last but if i end up reprogramming the remote once every year or more frequent id probably be very upset about it
because you will need the instructions every time when you program it you better be careful keep the instructions handy all the time
what a hassle and a burden in ones life this creates
you would have to be taking care of that thing as if it were one of the most important matters in your life
but come on its only a tv remote not a car
at this moment i am not even entirely sure where my new cars instructions are hopefully in the car
i know this remote will end up being a piece of junk as i will lose the instructions sooner or later
just the idea that i will be trying to find the instructions every once awhile and trying to figure out how i did it the last time to program the remote makes me sick
dont buy it unless your life quality is worth no more than a few bucksthe remote worked great until after  months
i can still use the remote with the built in codes
but after  months the learning feature stop workingdo not buy a magnavox universal remote for your dvd playerbuy a more reliable brand

i have the same problemwith the newer remote it cant grab certain menu functions to set up or play dvdsim not exaggerating
magnavox universal remotes suck on dvd playersi found the learning function extremely difficult
sometimes the learning  worked ok then teaching it other commands later it was very fussy as to the distance from the other remote and the heightangle facing each other
finally threw it awayafter trying to set some functions  times and still would not learnboth this model and thebelkin fhtvl travel surge protector with hidden swivel plugsuffer from the same dangerous design defect  if plugged into a v line they will fail by burning and short circuiting the line causing the place where it is plugged in to blow its breakers and lose power for whoever else is on the circuit
amazons info for either model says nothing about the voltage ratings
the reviews of the travel model fhtvl show numerous reports of blown circuits dont let the  part of the model number fool you this is for north american  voltage only not for the rest of the worlds  voltage
 the first time i traveled internationally i  lugged it in and it popped and smoke came out of it
it is for usa only
do not try to use this internationally
 this surge protector blew the circuit breaker in my hotel room in spain and i spent a day without electricity or air conditioning
i found out that it is not designed for european v circuits but nothing in the literature says that
for such a dangerous failure mode there ought at the very least to be large legible warnings on the units to say  volts only and dangerous at higher voltages
the only place on the unit or packaging where v is mentioned is a paragraph in the tiniest font of any of the writing on the unit  in much larger font is a warning not to use in aquariums
but the more important issue is that an item meant to protect electronic equipment from rare surges should not burn and blowout circuit breakers under any circumstance
that is an unacceptable mode of failure
when they fail it should be to an open circuit not a short circuit
underwriters laboratory should require belkin to redesign this line or revoke its underwriting of all the belkin units exhibiting this dangerous mode of failurereceived  days before expected delivery
surge protecters are just right for my purpose
one on each of telephone and modem connections
right size for my purposesoops
ordered  and installed upon receipt
one was installed on cordless base stationanswering machine
had a electrical spike yesterday  and base station fried
surge protectors indicator lights show everything still working

manufacturer panasonic says it is outdated model
costing me about  or sodont trust belkin at all nowlousy product
i used it to protect my refrigerator outlet
it didnt last more than  minute and the product smell  burnt and stopped working
i dont recommend this product to any body
poor quality
fire hazzardafter reading some of the negative comments here and on eopinions i almost didnt buy this player
i should have listened to the critics this cheap thing quit working after one week of light usei took very good care of it i only used it to play mp cds through my car stereo
it worked quite well at first i was happy with it but then it started skipping and pausing on my mp cds
so i tried a brand new audio cd and it did the same skip play skip pause skip play stop
so i upgraded the firmware and it only made it worse afterwards it wouldnt play anything
it just sits there spinning the cd never playing a notethis is the second lousy cdmp combo player ive bought jeez does anybody make a decent one of thesei had marantz universal commanderi use it many years and i want to buy something more modern looking such as touch screen and i buy itfirst it is very big as sizebtill the touch screen buttons are very difficult see and touchespecially in the dark almost impossible to to find the proper buttonand its heavy toofor the money i pay its a waste of your moneythe units ability to learn from other devices is great and it was able to learn from and emulate all of my devices without any problemsunfortunately the unit suffers from an inherent design defect which causes it to randomly freeze up requiring you to remove the batteries from the unit reseting the clock and reinstall them
this happened to me about once every other day when i was using it
unfortunately sonys email technical support wasnt very helpful in resolving the problemsjust to make sure it wasnt a bad unit i exchanged my unit at amazoncom but the second one did the same thingand im not the only person who had this problem
seefor more detailsfinally the units display while neat in several respects lacks any kind of tactile feel and makes it very difficult to press the correct button without looking carefully at the unit
it also retains fingerprints like crazy requiring you to clean the display to keep it from looking yuckyall in all i recommend the home theater master mx which you can buy at amazoncomi am really not too impressed
i had these for about six months before they developed a short in the wire leading up to the headphones
so they did not really last all that long
and they are frankly a bit uncomfortable so wearing them for longer than an hour is painfulthe phillips sport headphones are much better
i have two pairs of these and have worn one pair for over a year
no problems and very comfortablei have foolishly bought about  of these at various times
each and every one of them died on me and my wife within a few months of use
one went out within a monthquality control is nonexistent
we didnt use it rough just the normal gym use which is what it is advertised fornever again
sony when you decide to make things cheaply remember it is the same name on an expensive camera as well as a  headphones
you lose a bit of your shine each timei am looking at sennheiser panasonic etc nowearlier this fall i was shopping around at the mall for a new pair of headphones for my ipod
i came across the sony mdrgg s and decided to give them a whirl
now i wish i didnt
while the sound quality wasnt bad ive heard better from other sony earheadphones that i have owned in the past the comfort was a huge epic fail on sonys part
i know the design was to make the headphones was to be more snug for active users with the extra ear pieces but apparently the people who designed that feature never had to wear them for more than five minutes
i have gone back to phillips earphones that slides over my ears which i find a lot more freedom and comfort than this rancid headset from sony
the sound quality is better to in my personal opinioni would rate these headphones a zero but they actually transmit sound so i guess i cantfirst i had to crank my sansa clip to the maximum so i could hear music at a reasonable level compared to my current overtheear ear clipsmore importantly after  hours in the gym i could not wait to rip them off my ears  i was so much in painevery head movement twisted these headphones inducing another wave of pain
i must have looked like a zombie trying not to move my head to limit the paini cannot understand how anyone could wear these
i guess my ears must be deformedi guess i learned my lesson to stay away from this headphone design in the futurethis so called booster blocks the signal not boosting
i had it hooked up for a month and my signal was terrible faded in and out etc
decided to move antenna one day and that didnt help much either so just for the heck of it i removed the booster and signal strength went from  to  depending on what channel i was on
i tried this booster where the cable went into the house and within  feet of antenna made no difference
total waste of money i had waited to long to return it so it is setting on shelve ill sell it for  price ha dont think i will get any takers
buy a good antenna and be done with itinstalled it exactly as directions indicate but there was absolutely no change in the picture quality
i may try hooking it up at the point the cable enters the house and if there is an improvement ill revise this review but so far its been a waste of moneyi have comcast cable in my home
the cable comes in from the outside and then is split two ways
the first split feeds my main floor where i have two cable outlets
the second split feeds my second floor where i have one cable outlet so  cable outlets altogether
the reception on my second floor and one outlet on first floor have always been subpar so i purchased the motorola  signal booster to help
after a few weeks of testing and multiple ways of installing it it has provided zero improvement in my signalsome reviewers claim that you must install this at the entry point of your home
im not sure where they get that information from but i tried this way first and no improvement
i then tried the booster at each cable outlet and it showed no improvement
i tried many differnet combinations and many different channel tests and the signal was the same regardless
i even tried moving tvs around to test if it was the tv and no it was not
i moved vcrs as welli have ensured that all my cable connections are snug all the wiring is good
now understand that my picture on the poorer reception outlets is not terrible it is just lower than what it should be
the cable booster should improve the picture but it doesnti have a cable modem and cable tv
this item did not improve either
it soon burned out
make sure you get the exact booster for your systemthis thing wont improve your signali get the same number of channels with or without this amplifierand the signal strength stays the sameas you can see from the picture you must run the same type of tv cablefor power supply which makes thing really bulkyuseless and worthless thingto be very clear i bought this for the single purpose of amplifying my hdtv signal from my passive hdtv antenna
i bought it based on the reviews ive readhere is some advice if you are using any kind of splitter try bypassing it to see if your splitter is bad
i got  of all my stations in atlanta simply by bypassing my  in  out leviton integrated network splitter
if i connected it straight to the receiver i got  on my channel meters
when i hooked the booster in i got max 
i tried it in front of the splitter after the splitter and even without a splitter reduced signal by half and is just did not work at all for me
pretty disappointing and im out  shippingmaybe mine was defective i returned it didnt want to waste time trying to get it checked out
my signal was pretty good analog cable but went thru a splitter and was slightly degraded on some stations
with this booster it was a lot more degraded
i swapped it with a simple maletomale barrel connector for testing and the picture was much much worse with this boosterill keep this short
the only way that i could tell that the signal booster was working at all was by a drop in my internet speed and the little green light was on
other than that the picture quality stayed the samei have yet to see much difference in the signal boost that this unit purports to give
i bought this on the positive  reviews of others and a hope that i could improve a poor comcast signal  wrong on both accountsconnected all the wires and plugged it in
it did not work at all
now i have to return itdoes cold weather effect it
the ups guy just dropped it off
i waited for it to warm up
did the freeze damage ittried this unit on both my satellite and vhfufh roof antenna connections in all possible locations from house entrance point to right before the tv
it invariably would transform a  signal into a  signal
i thought the unit might be defective so replaced it for a new one
same problem
this unit is less than useless for over the air ota signals
the documentation that came with the unit is deceptive in claiming that it will work for ota applicationsfortunately amazon has been very good about returnsmy signal strength went from  to   not worth the electricity it uses
and what is up with the rg cables
anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use rg
it is being sent back for a refundi bought this product to boost our internet connection
description said that it will improve cable modem signal
however when i connected this device our internet connection completely stoppedi tried it a couple of times
without the device i can get to the internet albeit at an unsatisfactory speed
with the device no connection at allso i returned the product to amazonsomeone said this tv has a great picturewrongthis has one of the worst pixelated screens i have ever seenthe sound is extremely weak toodo not buy this one
id like to give this tv a zero ratingif i could
i needed a tv of any sort in a pinch and bought this one much to my regret
i am going to try to take it back add about  and get something worth watchingone good thing about this tvit worked right out of the boxif like i you are looking for a truly portable radio to use in the gym take a pass on this one
specifically the controls are nonintuitive tiny and difficult to use
when used indoors it is vulnerable to rf interference static like most asian electronics it has too many features
who really wants to listen to tv and weather bands
am and fm alone are enough
the unit is reatively heavy bulky and uncomfortabledont waste your money
youll end up not using iti had the prior sony model and it was just ok but i liked the armbandthis one has worse reception than the old
but worse yet it is made such that if you snag the radio on something the volume control knob easily breaks off
dont waste your money
i am now looking for a regular small radio that i can out in a pouch while exercisingso i dont sound like im slamming linksys
my usb device by them is awesome and my router works like a champ but the wet is a dud
it doesnt set up easy i never made it work and linksys technical support clearly have no idea how to make it workfour hours a restocking fee and tons of heart ache later im looking elsewhere for my wireless bridgei was unable to get the device to work
i am returning it for a competing modelim technically savvy but i couldnt get it to work with my network
i also brought it in to best buy to see if they could get it to work and they couldnt
from reading reviews there is clearly a problem with some of these units just not workingif your looking for a device to bridge with as i once did in this device head on over to belkins fd wireless ethernet adapter and read my review
belkins equipment is so much more reliable it does what you ask it to and doesnt flinch like inferior dlink and linksys productsthis linksys device is straight garbagebought this for my son for christmas
on day two the antenna system broke
now it wont pick up a single channel  and he lives in a city of  million people
a huge disappointmentthis pocket radio has never worked properly
off  on controls are inconsistent
if turns on will go off immediately or after a few seconds to less than a minute
checked all connections and could not locate an issue
it arrived with a short and cannot be returned as i waited too long
ive purchased a hundred products from amazon and this is the first one that is a complete  fubar
hope you order one that worksmine did not and will just be placed in a discard pilethe power button on the radio diedi never pushed hard on the button or exposed it to moisture
i think that the button is poor quality and after a certain number of uses it just stops workingmy radio will not turn on now and it is past the  day warrantyread the reviews of the other people that gave it a onestar rating
many of them have the same problemi commute hrs each way and since i can only listen to the tunes on my ipod so many times i was hoping to find a radio with the best reception possible so i would not lose the signal along the wayive owned several sony sfrmv and after getting frustrated i found the sangean on amazon
after reading the reviews i figured i would give it a shot
unfortunately there was no comparison  the sony beats the sangean hands downyeah sure the sangean looks cooler and it looks like it has some interesting features but after you use it for a while you realize those features are more of a hassle than anythingoh and did i mention that i accidentally dropped the sangean today and it no longer works
yes its my fault but dropping is to be expected with such a device and i dropped the sony a hundred times with no impact to its function other than a cracked batter coverif you are looking for reception my recommendation is to go for the sony which you can find for  in most retailers rather than  sangeani originally gave the sangean dt a good review
however after just  days of careful normal use the left earbud only plays intermittently
i should have heeded the advice of the bad review writers
i will now have to go to the gargantuan hourswasting task of getting a refund less  for return postagepurchased this radio in april
sound quality was not good
i own two radio shack optimus brand radios that ive owned  years and are close to wearing out
sound quality far better radios are smaller in size and they still work
not as good as their prior direct digital push button tuners these you must do the really dumb scan thru presets but still okthis current radio lost it audio several times since i purchased it
ear phones would still function but speaker would not
i would pull batteries for a couple of days and audio would recover
however no longer recoversthis is the nd small radio that ive purchased from amazon that has failed
the other one is a kaito brand
failed in  months
this radio at least had push button tuning but is far larger
sound quality on it was also poorthere is so much junk out there
i suppose the assumption is that if a few work out ok others fail but the customer does not wish to waste the time to return or send in for warranty the manufacturer can declare victory and go home with a success rate that allows them to have  percent of customers satisfiedim still hoping that one day someone will build and sell a radio such as the old optimusradio shack direct push button tuner like you car radio push a button and you get a different station
until then i suppose if i wish to listen to radio when out for a walk do not want to use ear phones speaker required then i will remain stuck with the junk that is now availablesonyyou have a neat little push button radio that has been very reliable for me
however requires ear phones
perhaps you all should figure how to incorporate a speaker in a slightly larger size
you would have a winnerat least for menow to find if this current thing has any warranty service
likely will cost more in postage and time then it is worth to get it repaired or replacednow  weeks later radio is returned and now is working weeks
 it only took me  days to receive from amazon and  day to send it to sangean
radio now works but sound quality remains poor when above minimum volume level
my  year old radio shack optimuss sound much better
speaker sounds as though cracked but likely just a cheap amp as earphones are also very poor at any reasonable volumeive had two types of sangean radios of this size and i use them to fall asleep at night
i thought this model would be a big improvement over the larger black one but changing stations is hitting one button and then another button and then if you wait a few seconds you have to do that all over againwith the slightly larger black unit you just push one button to go through every programmed channel in every band much more convenient
this unit has good sound quality and would be the best unit they ever produced if only they had made the channel surfing a one button deal that was always available instead of button button button buttonexcept for the pain in the tuckus channel changing this is an excellent unit but for me that one annoyance dooms it
buy a sangean just not this particular modelalso the older black and very small silver models had a headset jack that broke easily and they have replaced that with a good jack and sangean offered to trade in the old models with defective headset jacks for newer units of the same style
that was certainly a positive demonstration of good customer service
anyone can buy a defective part for their production line not every company will be so ethical as to replace the unit well after the warranty because they found out they had sourced a defective partmy first issue with the sangean dtv is that the reception is no better than the  sony i purchased back in   my second is that after only a few months of use my dtv no longer works
my  sony still does
too bad my old sony doesnt have digital tuningread the review carefully before shelling out any money for this radio based on the name sangean because the reception on this radio is subsangean
i have the sangean prd and in a sidebyside comparison the reception on the prd radio is excellent both am  fm whereas the same reception on the dt with the cheap little plugin wire antenna they provide is really awful
other than that the ease of use is good and the sound quality is what you would expect from a little radio like this
but at the end of the day if it doesnt pull in the stations little else mattersill be returning this for sure
i bought this from datavision instead of amazon and now have to pay a  restocking fee  return shipping because i dont like this item what a mistakei have been using the rca vrhf heavily for about two months
on the plus side it is a good player
that is about the only good thing i can say about itthe main problem with this vcr is the remote
the bottom two corners of the remote are kind of square and sharp
the bottom third of the remote should have been left void of buttons but rca chose to put the buttons that you need to use to play a movie down there
so if you are not good with your hands you will drop this remote quite a bit
the remote has most of the its weight in the top half
the buttons are small
if you have larger hands you will hate this remotethe most logical number to be displayed in the vcr lcd display is the number of minutes you have played
but no rca decided to display the time of day instead
so whenever you want to fast forward over a television add  you cant see how many minutes you are fast forwarding over
the way around this is to reach you thumb from very lower right of the remote up to the top left of the remote and press the info
button twice to get the vcr time recorded to display on the tv screen
note that there is only one fast forward speed and that it is impossible to stop right at the end of an add break so some rewinding is necessary
after you get the tape to the desired position you have to press the info
button yet again to get the display off of the tv screento record programs you have to first set the speed
standard play  to  and extra long play  to  are the choices
whatever happened to long play  to 
you have to enter the  digit start time and then say the number  for pm very very slowly or the machine cant reed your input
if you did not set the recording speed correctly before you entered a tv program to record you have to delete your entry and start over by pressing the clear buttonafter you get your events to record entered it is imperative that you review all events to ensure that they are entered successfully
now you have to turn the vcr off or it wont do any automatic taping
note that this vcr will start recording over whatever tape is in the machine if it is set to record and somebody turns it off to save energythe look of the vcr is tall and square and it is silver coloredmechanically it is a quite unit and it records well quality wise if you clean it once every  hours or so
as a recorder it is a very frustrating unit to use
if you want to tape something important i recommend that you set the tape speed and set a kitchen timer so you can start recording manually using the button on the front of the unitif this unit had a newly designed remote had the time elapsed displayed in the lcd readout had the long play option and was colored black it would be a great unit
as it is its a second class player onlythis is an out of date gps that has been discontinued by garmini had a lot of problems downloading the driver into my notebook and desktop both running windows xp
i had to try several times i am computer savvy
the memory card that came with unit was defective i had to get a new one from garmin and you can easily damage it
you have to use their th century card reader to plug to your pc to download the software to the unit
you cannot hook the unit directly to your pc unless you have an old serial portmalethe memory card mb can only hold so much map data
while the lcd has an excellent resolution thats why i am giving a one star rating it will take you some time before you can learn all the features of the units and the map sourceto sum things up stay away from this gps invest a few more hundreds and get a newer versionthe gps v is not suitable for automotive use primarily because it is way way too slow
additionally i would not recommend buying any product from garmin because their support is notoriously badi bought the gps v to use in the washington dc area a few years ago but it quickly became apparent that it was nearly useless due to the slow speed and the errors in the maps
at the rate that you have to make freeway ramps and lane changes when traveling in a congested metropolitan area you are already past the next turn before the gps v has figured out that you have made the prior turn and has updated the screen to show you the next turn
you invariably end up off the route and waiting for it to catch up
when it prompts you for a reroute and you confirm it spends several minutes trying to calculate the reroute and if you assumed that you could keep traveling while it does this you will already be miles beyond the turn off point for the reroute be the time that it is displayed
the thing is a joke
there have been many times that i have noticed while stopped at a traffic light where i am supposed to make a lefthand turn and waiting for the light to change the message on the display is saying that i am supposed to turn several hundred feet further down the road
i suppose this is probably due to errors in the location assigned to the roads and intersections in the stored maps but that only underscores the fact that the unit is only as good as the accuracy of the maps which are very poor
all in all it works as long as you dont drive above  mph you stay away from major metropolitan areas and you never assume that it knows your location relative to the stored map with accuracy any better than a half a city blockthe pc application mapsource is another source of frustration
knowing from past experience that you can run out of fuel in the middle of kansas if you dont plan ahead i wanted to plan the fuel stops for a trip across on my motorcycle which has a safe range of about  miles
you would think that something this obvious would be easy to do with a tool that is intended primarily for finding road routes
you would think that there would be a way to get it to show you just the gas stations on the map when you have it zoomed in to a suitable scale
not so
you can select show services in the preferences but it still wont show services unless you are zoomed in really really close and unbelievably you still cant see the fuel stations because the fuel station icons are covered over with the blue grocery cart icon used for stores of every sort and size
because there are so many stores of various sorts anytime that service icons are displayed the area where there is likely to be fuel stations is literally covered over with a bunch of little blue grocery carts
it simply boggles my mind that this is how mapsource works now several years after it was first released
if i hadnt seen it myself i wouldnt have believed it
but one thing that it does well is show you all the dinky little airstrips
but why
it seems unlikely to me that pilots of any sort would use mapsource at all and certainly not with the cityselect maps so why do they show all those little airports
there is no way to get rid of that either
even if you turn off services display the airports still are shown
so you can easily find airstrips but you cant find fuel stations
dumb dumb dumb
you pay good money for this thing in the expectation that it is going to be a commercial grade product that will allow you to select routes and plan fuel stops but instead you get airstrips
it is very annoying and this exemplifies the general attitude of garmin which is that they will get around to making it work for the intended purpose if and when it suits their whimthis experience has left me with a strong dislike for garmin
i paid to update the map once but i couldnt tell any difference
ive been told that the latest version of the cityselect map is much improved so i decided to pay them their ransom for the map upgrade
it would not install giving up at the end and not giving any useful information beyond the fact that the install failed
i removed all the earlier versions and tried a few more times but without any success
i called their technical support number which shuts down at  pm my time and at  pm west coast time and after waiting on hold for nearly  minutes got connected to someome who led me through the same steps that i had already tried and after a couple of hours gave up and said that he was going to send me the full install version of the dvd which he thought should work better than the update dvd
it arrived and i tried it but it behaved exactly the same giving every indication that it was copying all the required files from the dvd to the hard drive but then when it should be finished it reported that the install was unsuccessful
i managed to get through to their technical support but then about ten minutes into the call and promptly at  pm denver time he hung up on me with no warning
just abrupt silence
i called again the next day and the technical support person informed me that they were aware of a problem with the installation wizard when installing on windows xp service pack   the solution is to uninstall sp then run the installation wizard and then reinstall sp after cityselect v has been successfully installed
with no other solution offered i took this route
the uninstall of sp took more than an hour and after the sucessful install of cityselect v i spent the remainder of the day and well into the evening hours trying to get windows xp back to its prior state even with a  mbps cable modem connection
telling people to uninstall sp is a horrible solution to this problem yet that is their standard solution
sp was introduced roughly a year ago so how can it be that after a year garmin is unable to write an install script that is compatible with sp
this boggles my mind and once again exemplifies garmins cavalier attitude for customer needsabove all what i have found to be the most bothersome is that mapsource is still not integrated with the handheld gps v  i have attempted several times to define a route in mapsource and then download it into the gps v and use it
this works adquately well as long as the route is fully contained in the map set that you load into the gps v  but because the memory is limited when you want to plan a single route that will guide you around more than one major city such as kansas city st louis and louisville the obvious stratgy is to pick only the maps needed for the tricky parts of those cities
when you define the route in mapsource there is no effort to check it against the maps that you intend to download which is okay because you should be able to download routes that are not fully contained within the maps that you download
they know better than to restrict that because that would mean that it is not possible to define and download a longer crosscountry route at all using mapsource
but given that the gps v doesnt handle at all intelligently with this situation what they probably should do is check the routes against the maps when you start the download and then refuse to download the routes if they are not contained with the maps
when you attempt to navigate the defined route using the gps v a warning message pops up that tells you that the route doesnt agree with the available maps and asking if you would like to recalculate the route
your intuition is to say yes but if you do the entire route will be recalculated including the portion that is within the maps that are in the gps v
that is just plain stupid
when i first discovered this serious malfunction about three years back i called their technical support person a couple of times and asked if there were any written notes about this that might help me to figure out a good strategy for how to deal with this situation when i encounter it
i never got a useful response and i really think that this just falls under the heading of it doesnt work that way
garmin never invested a single minute to figure out what the gps v ought to do in this sort of entirely reasonable scenario and certainly never took the time to explain to the customers how to best deal with it
based on my experience if you decline the prompt to recalculate the route the routes are identified to you using a meaningless number which is presumably a numerical code for the given segment of road which the gps v uses to look up the street name when the map is present
this behavior would be understandable when you are out of the region covered by the maps that you have downloaded but it seems to continue in this mode even when you have entered the region covered by the maps in the gps v  it seems although im not  certain because they never bothered to explain this that if do not accept the prompt to recalculate the route it will not again attempt to look up the route segments in the stored maps
what i have observed most of the time is that once you are in the area covered by the stored map if you stop the navigation and then start it again by selecting the route from the menu not by recalculating the route it will work as expected for a little while
however at other times even when well within the region covered by the stored map it seemed to behave the same as when the map wasnt presentmy real grip about all of this is not so much that it works as it does but that it is virtually impossible to have a useful understanding of how it works because garmin has not bothered to document it and probably has not bothered to explore how it actually works when you define a route in mapsource with the intention of navigating it in the gps v  they build capabilities that work fine in a laboratory environment but they dont seem to make an effort to discover how it works in actual practice or if they do they never bother to explain to anyone else what they discovered and what you might want to understand in order to be able to work around the limitations yourselfive never used one of their street pilot models but even if they work a lot better than the gpsv as they surely must youre still going to be stuck with mapsource on the pc and youre still going to be stuck with garmins lousy customer support
there has got to be a better solutionthis product is pure junki used it with my ipodand it broke only after  daysi bought it because i sweat aloton the rd day at the gymthe volume in both sides would not go above a certain point
too low for me to heari know it wasnt my ipod because when i bought a new pair of a different brand of headphonesthe volume problem disapearedi brought them back to best buy for my money backthese are good enough for what i need in headphones for walking around but they always break
i mean i understand that everything will eventually break  but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time
if these cost  and you need to buy  pairs a year compared to ones that cost  and they last two years the latter are the less expensive pairbeing cheap i would prefer if these would just not break so easily  and it isnt that im being rough with them  i treat them well but eventually they die usually the sound goes out in the left eari am no longer going to get these fool me  times
doh  i got these to replace my old  yellow sony sports headphones similar design  they sound fine but as one of the other reviewers noted these headphones are very poorly constructed i broke them within  weeks the weak joint is the plastic part that moves in  out
i thought ok my fault ill be more careful thus i bought another pair broke those as well while just routinely opening them up etc  since these are to be used by folks doing sports etc i cant understand why sony made such a poorly constructed headphonei really liked these things at first because they actually stayed in my ears however   they hurt your ears if they stay in for any length of time hard jagged plastic poking into the sides of your ears and
i was just barely handling the things at the gym and the adjustment piece snapped apartthese things are entirely too fragile
sony should be ashamed
they used to have metal where this fragile plastic is today
i can not say it enough  shame on sony for making such trashhope you got a good price because these will break quickly due to the cheap plastic and lack of qualityif i had given these headphones a review two or three months ago i definitely would have given them four or five starstheyve been my favorite headphones for years
not necessarily because of the sound quality quite passable but definitely not audiophile quality but for the compact convenience of them they fold up neatly and tightly and are easy to stow in a pocket or backpack
ive used these phones for years and they have always lasted many many months until the wiring pulled out from the plug usually through my own rough use
a couple pairs on which i had the foresight to apply some precautionary electrical tape around the wire near the plug lasted for more than a yeari havent been able to find these headphones in retail stores for almost a year so i was pleased when i noticed amazon carried them
several months ago i ordered a set and put it away for when id eventually wear out my old set
a couple weeks ago i at last switched to the new set and two days after starting to use them the headphones snapped in two at one of the folding jointsa problem i have never had with over a dozen pairs of these headphones before
well maybe that was usererror
i ordered two more sets and started using the first last week
it snapped in two the day before yesterday
the second pair snapped in two today
that cant be user error thats faulty construction
im beginning to see why the bricksandmortar stores dont carry them anymore i dont know what sony has done in the process of the manufacture of these headphones but theyve changed them from my fave headphones to cheap breakable garbage
i wont be buying them againim amazed at all the people whove given this three plus stars even though theyve broken multiple units
they are decent while they work but for the price of three sets you could get something better to begin with
they are good for working out but my first set broke after three months
i figured id be more careful with the second set but they broke after  month
both broke at the hinges just like everyone elses
now im out the money spent on those two sets and i have to invest more  in something decent that will last
these are garbage save yourself the aggravation and buy something betteri liked the fact that it did not fall off my head while exercising and i liked the sound
it insulated outside noises reasonably wellbut after a two week use it broke in half when i tried to unfold it
i was always very gentle with it and i was shocked when the main hinge center one just broke
upon inspection i found that it was made from plastic and it was weak by designit went straight into the garbage bin
wasted  plus shipping and a few kilograms of co in the atmospheremy friend had these on and he has glasses and he looked like a robot or something stupid
they may be good quality sound but they just look so stupid i thought i should warn you if you have glasses you should get better earphones that have wiresbroke when folding gently after one month of running with themvery uncomfortable for ear would never buy againif this is supposed to be for sport use its a jokethese were nice while they lasteddidnt fall out of my ears didnt deplete the battery on my mp player too quickly
but they broke after just a couple months of normal use by which i mean that i used them a lot but never tried to fold them
keep shoppingthese are not good headphonesive gone through many different sets of headphones as a runner and im always looking for some that are comfortable stay in my ear and dont break
ive never found a set that meets all three criteria
these phones have pretty decent sound but did not stay in my ear very well especially once i started sweating
the phones would sit in my ear okay but if i wanted really good sound i would have to push down on the bud into my eardrum and instantly it would sound twice as goodloud
after i would start to sweat the buds would gradually get looser and move farther from my ear drum
on really long runs they would even pop out of my ear completelyin addition to the eardrum fit i did not like the way they fit over the head
i would have to adjust the phones and tighten them at least once a mile and i couldnt wear a cap or head covering in the winter with these as theyre too stiff to put anything over
the cord from the phones is pretty bad too as it twists into itself just slightly and is never truly straight
finally i dont know what the sweat guard mechanism is for because the functionality of these phones drops  at least once i started sweating
and like every pair of phones ive had they went mono and the left phone eventually stopped working almost surely because it was ruined by sweati would have given these phones  stars because despite how cheap they are they did last me around  miles of use which is more than most phones last me but i have to give it  because they specifically advertise it in a way that makes you think it is sweatproof but i can almost guarantee you if you sweat enough these phones will eventually succumb to it just like pretty much every sport headphone on the market todaybroke  times in  different spots within  weeks
cheap brittle plastic breaks very easily
the sound is great and the waterproof is great but what good is that if you cant wear them
im not very rough with them eitherdo yourself a favor and buy the version that does not fold up
i had those for years and bought the fold up ones because i lost my nonfold up version
the nonfoldup version has the same sound very durable and seem to last forevernot the aspect ratio of widescreen
it is not wide enough for your  elitebooki bought this for use with my new  macbook air
i used one of the gold films on my lenovo tablet and it worked great so i figured id try one for my air
big mistakewhen placed on the screen it creates dark likes all over the screen and distorts text
it renders the display unreadable and gives you a headache after a few minutes
ive written m about this issue as i find it totally ridiculous that a privacy filter doesnt work with the most portable notebook out there the macbook airheres hoping m has some sort of solution up its sleeve
im not sure if there are even any other options and thats a shamethe viewing field with this product in place is far too wide
you can stand  degrees from the monitor and still see the screen
you practically have to be standing at a  degree angle from the screen to have it blank out
most lcd monitors are difficult to read from that angle anywaysreturned minethe privacy screen is very good dont get me wrong  but with a company like m behind it you would think that there would be a better adhesive solution
the hard plastic tabs  different options on how to apply screen are just awful  slipped off literally the first few minutes i applied to my laptop screen
for  this is so wrong
if m eventually comes up with better technology on how to attach the privacy screen then id definitely be sold  but right now as i type the only m product im a fan of is the scotch tape i put on each corner to hold the privacy screen in place for the time being  im thinking its ridiculous  this is unfortunately going to have to go back to amazon asapit doesnt stickwork with touch screens
tried in all possible ways but its just a waste of time
it wont stick wellthis privacy protector works so well not even the user can see what they are doing
thats a slight exaggeration but not by much it is so dark even with the brightness of my laptop turned all the way up it is really hard to see through it
also it throws off color quality enormously so if you need to see correct colors this isnt for youanother knock against this is that its not a film that sticks to your screen you have to stick a bunch of small plastic tabs around the edge of your screen and slide the privacy filter down into the space created
if you are carryign your laptop while closed and it turns even slightly upside down the filter slides outi would give this at least  stars if not for the priceorder a size above what you need as i have a gap of ch on either side of the monitor since this screen is smaller than advertised or shown
not as per size specifiedwas unusable for me on my toshiba laptop
it created a window like wire mesh look and made reading text and seeing the contents on the screen very hard
i returned it back to amazonif you are looking for privacy dont buy this since product does not work as advertised i can see my pc almost the same viewable area is like  degrees yes it dark your area if you are not in front but still you can clearly see what you have in your pcnotebook when you are not directly in fronti have sore  red eye no thanks to this stupid product from myou want privacy dont use the desktop or laptop when therere someone behindmove your sitting position
put a mirror to keep a look out in case some one sneak from behindill keep this short  the actual filter works fantastic
it fits my  macbook pro perfectly and does exactly what its supposed to do
unfortunately the cheap plastic stickon tabs that they expect you to mount the filter with are awful  they dont adhere well at all to my screen and i constantly have to restickadjust them every time i openclose the laptopit does what its supposed to do but i wouldnt recommend it due to the terrible design of the mounting stickersa month or two later and its in the trash
tabs are junk filter doesnt fit newer dell laptops
useless and overpricedthis does not work for macbook air  you see jagged lines on filter surface makes reading harder for you as welldoesnt really work  just makes the screen darker
waste of money
disappointing
not much else to say about thisthe cable i received was a  mm jack to male rca audio and video
this caused issues with the soundthe strain relief on the mm connector is subpar which caused mine to lose the left channel to an internal broken wire due to repeated strain
you should handle it carefully dont let the cable near the connector bend too much or it will have issuesive since learned that the cable is also poorly shielded to the point that it is picking up a local pop music station
im disappointed in belkin i used to trust their cables to be strong and reliable apparently not anymorewould not buy again nor recommend to others
im going to replace this with themediabridge  mm male to  rca stereo audio cable   feetshortly as the  foot cable will no longer serve my needs
plus it was awful anywaysas far as i can tell this cable is not a belkin branded cable and it caused a buzzing sound in my speakersthis is a belkin cable and came in the sealed packaging as shown
the cable is of a nice sturdy thickness and seems well constructed
i got this cable at the end of february  now in march  not quite a month later the right channel started to cut out
by adjusting the cable coming out of the mini jack i can get the right channel to come in but im very disappointed that this cable is already failing
i admit i do unplug and plug the cable into different devices but i really didnt expect to start having signal problems so soon
the cable seemed well constructed but apparently not so well
if you dont mess with the cable you could be alright with it but if you will be plugging and unplugging it often be aware that it will probably start to cut out all too soonwell the end that goes in your phone or whatever your plugging into got bend and sound goes in and out was a pain in the ass to fix lifetime warranty it has but not the hassle to contact belkin to get a new onethis phone cord did not work
i could hear the other party on the line butthey could not hear me
to ship it back would cost more than just orderinganotheri ordered a ge from another seller
it works greatsimply terrible
out of the box it was all stretchted out and ruined to begin with
as best i could tell it wasnt a return or anything
these are just very cheaply made
and of course i needed it right then so no return possibleunraveled in  days  dont waste your money  it cheaply madei got what i paid for
alot of crapwhen im using this splitter the audio only comes out of one side
going to see if i can have it replaced for freei received two of these
the first broke about a week after fist used
the second broke a week laterboth broke the same way one or the other channel cut out when the cable is jiggledterrible quality  for the connections wont go all the way into the two female ends
i have tried two different male connection and both go about  of the way in
at first it wasnt an issue with sound quality but now the speaker volume is reduce by  and it only comes out of one of the two speakersthis is not a genuine belkin item or at least it wasnt from the seller i purchased from bastexwireless
got a refund alreadyheres what it does it takes a stereo signal dumps the right channel replaces it with a copy of the left channel
and its like that on both output jackstheres nothing weird about the shape or size and it all plugs in completelypurchased from elite inc  the item was generic no belkin branding or packaging and not what was expected
the signal was split so that the left channel came through one set of headphones and the right channel came through the other set of headphones
inserting at different depths only resulted in slightly louder or softer signal
each set of headphones should play both channels of the original signal unchanged if only lower in volume
it also had very tightfitting connections
update  elite incs response was that i would have to return the item at my expense
also i noticed that the name on the packaging and the return address was sapfire not elite inc  that seems odd to me
i will be contacting amazon about a refundbought it after seeing the hundreds of reviews but unfortunately the plug is loose for my macbook pro stereo out and hence it constantly causes the sound to go back and forth between the mac speakers and external out with the slightest movement of my laptopmy laptop stereo out is perfectly fine since all other cables fit snugly into it except this onei ordered  units of this belkin speaker and headphone splitter from sapfirewhen it arrived there was no proper belkin bubble pack
just a small little plastic bag held all the  units
there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item
anyway i assumed it would work well and immediately plugged it in for usewhat a mistakebecause from one output of the splitter i could only hear the right channel
and from the other output of the splitter i could only hear the left channeli could not believe my ears so i tested all  units
they all turnedout to be the samethere was absolutely no stereo output at allwhat a waste of time i spent testing and retesting these items from sapfireit was a real disappointmenti purchased this splitter so my wife and i could watch movies on my tablet during our recent flight
we only were using ear buds and one side would only output the music track on one set of ear buds and no dialogue track
spinning the headphone plug around in the port made the dialogue track pop to life in certain spots
i switched the other pair of ear buds to the good port and verified it was my an issue with the ear budsi bought this because i wanted it in a few days before our trip
im not going to return them for the small price i paidthe splitter i received only output sound to one ear not both
this is supposed to be a stereo to stereo splitter but what i got was a stereo to left ear splitternot even a full day of usage and already one of the female connections stopped working heard a pop  now only one side works
be warned of the bad qualityi bought it because it was cheap and i just want a splitter but when i tried this sometimes one of the plugs just doesnt work i need to move it so it start working
im sure there are better out there and cheaperi thought because if was belkin i was getting something descent but i was wrongi got it so i could use it with bose  too hug up my tv and record player
it only last a few day and the sound went in and out on the record player
then it stop working on the left inputi bought this to split headset and desktop speakersplugged it into my pc audio out and plugged in my desktop speakers it created an annoying audio commonmode noisetried reseating a few times still makes the commonmode noise
i went to amazon returns and printed out a return label and noticed that it was not prepaid it was shipped from a place called amamax who emailed me to asked me to rate this productits a  item and return shipping cost more then the itemwhy was this a recommendation for my audiovox acoustic research aw mission style wireless outdoor speaker when it doesnt have any place to plug it it
im disappointed that amazon recommended it as an add onthis item did not work right from the stzrt
i ended up buying another one from radio shack instead and no problems fromt that onedoes not work well unless you find the exact sweet spot on twisting the plugs in the female jacks of this device
otherwise i heard just a muted and muffled soundmy setup and purpose  ipod and ipad to allow  kids to listen to music or watch movies on a plane
headphones were  brand new beats studio hd 
it didnt matter which plug and both headphones had problems
individually in the ipod and ipad both headphones performed well
i could not rely on the kids to hold the splitter in just the right position so this product was useless to us
if i buy another i will choose something of better qualitydo not buyi didnt expect much because of the cost
consider it a lesson learnedthis is not a belkin product  false advertisingthe product doesnt make a good connection with headphones
both sets of headphones i tried with it had volume control and both if you fidgeted just right would get stereo at times
also for some reason if you held down the call button the stereo would worknot pleased at all now i am buying a different product because this one does not do what i need it to do at alli use these a lot and to be honest i dont love them at all
i have to keep moving them around a lot for me and my fianceacute to both be able to fully hear
they werent expensive so i guess you get what you pay for but i would suggest buying a higher quality productthis splitter has different sound levels in your ears
this throws my entire hearing off
eg
the right ear is about twice as loud as the left ear in my headphones and the person i am sharing with has the exact opposite problem
i know that this can be an issue because of the way that the wiring works but that is ridiculous
why would i even use iti bought this to unify my ps and computer sound cables into one to my sound system so as to not have to change from one input to the other each time
well than god its dirt cheap cos this product is terrible
the sound quality degraded a lot and even the volume did weird things with both inputs plugged in the volume went down like by half and just disconnecting one of them restored things to normal
weirdif youre looking for good quality sound stay away from this crapi bought two of these for the office
they are supposed to be no kink no tangle chords that is a bold faced lie they are constantly tangledits  all coiled up
to sterch it to  you have to stretch the cord and pull the coils out
i had expected some  long without stretching the curlsthis  foot telephone cord comes out of the package  feet long
the only possible way it could ever be  feet long is if you not only stretched it but actually untwisted it which would also be impossible to do
i dont blame the retailer for this
it is the manufacturer who packaged the item who is deceiving buyers
the cord seems like a quality cord
it is just a quality  foot long cordupdated review after a two months of use this cord is exactly like my old onea tangled mess
i thought this was going to be the solution to my tangled cord problem but it ended up being a very short lived solution
the customer service on the order was great but unfortunately this cord tangles badly
i am now in the market for something elseyou would think that since we now have cars that can drive themselves someone could invent a phone cord that does not tanglei could not take my tangled office phone cord any longer
i ordered this and it came in just a few days even though it was not prime eligible
sound quality and construction quality are great
i can finally answer my phone without the fear of jerking my phone into the floor or hitting myself in the ear trying to raise the handset
very happy with this purchase and the selleri have a wireless roku now and purchased a wireless router to accomidate the streaming video player
i accidentially ordered this  ethernet cord
not realizing i didnt need an ethernet cord with a wireless routerwhen the cord arrived at the post office i refused it and got a credit of i bought this cable to replace an older belkin ministereo audio cable that i had been using for years
this new cable was a bit thinner gauge wire and the connector is also shorter
this combination results in a cable that is unable to plug into my samsung galaxy s because the connector is too short with my cell phone case attached
the case is a thin rubber item and doesnt add more than a few mm to the thickness but that is enough to keep this cable from working there
primarily i use this with an ipod touch but it has the same issues with plugging in while it has a case on
my old belkin never had a problem as it has a longer connector but this one struggles
when i do get it plugged in the cord will short out frequently if it is bent even slightly
i have found a better cable at the local big lots that does not short out like this one
this is a garbage cord and should be avoided unless you only intend to plug it into a device once and leave it stationary for the rest of your life
not durable not a quality component not worth any amount of moneytried connecting cable from my sound card on my pc to my speakers and it just buzzes and pops
ive tried other shorter cables and they worked finebought this item
it appears that win xp wont recognize it and there doesnt appear to be any drivers of any sort for itbelkin does not have the product pn listed on their website any longer and does not even appear under the discontinued listingsalways like belkin products but this one is a big fiyasco
total losslike the other purchasers who have reviewed it here it also didnt work for me at all and i tried absolutely everything although it did seem to power up the wheel it was not recognized at all by xp i understand this as the wheel is not plug and play but the installation of many different drivers and software did not help
threw it and the wheel away
getting a new usb wheel for xmas i hopedo not buy this
i thought i found the finishing piece i was looking for for my new computer  boy did i ever fall for it
does not work at all and their are no drivers for it from belkin microsoft or any of the sellersi bought this item because my new pc dint have a db game port if you are running windows xp it will not recongcide the divice so it will be worthlessi suppose that this would be an ok piece of gear if you dont have a viewsonic monitor but if you do stay away from it
it does not work with the dvi connectors on the viewsonic flat panel monitors
instead you need to order the dvi ii extractor from dr bott
this is a major hit since viewsonic is one of the larger and more popular monitor brands availablewhy anyone would need this is beyond me
the adc is male need female the dvi is female need male
wanted to send it back but roommate threw away boxon the very first use sound only comes from one side of my headphones when using this extension cable
do not buyafter using it under the most gentle conditions the wire failed out of one channel after  months
also it was not a belkin product but rather a generic cordmine was missing the left channel when new from the package
the return options didnt include replacement so i ended up going to a local radio shack to get a headphone extensioni am a systems analyst and pc troubleshooter by profession
this belkin cable failed repeated tests to read and write data successfully to my new lg external dvd writer
after ruling out other factors media usb port the simple fact is  it could not create dvd backup disks every attempt failed several coasters were created  and once i effortlessly created two dvd backups successfully using another cable the belkin cable could not even verify the successful disks in readonly mode
sorry
returning for refundbeware buying this product from the vendor citi electronics
they shipped me generic noname brand cables instead of the unique cablestogo snagless custom boots
the generics are like typical ethernet cables with the thick molded boot that fully encapsulates the plastic tab used to unlock the cable from a jack
ive found trying to press on this thick thumb bump boot to push on the tab difficult to use and sometimes i have to pull the boot back in order to press directly on the tab to properly disengage it
it seems these generic boots are just too large and may actually be pressed up against the jack housing causing tension on the jack and making disengagement harder hence my need to peel back the boot or forcibly push the cable further into the jack to unload the tension on the tabwhich is why i now use the cablestogo snagless versions as it uses a light and small vinyl flap that rests on the plastic locking tab to aid in disengaging yet allows easy unobstructed view and access to this tab to ensure you are properly disengaging it without adding any stress or tension to the connectionordered two and they were not snagless  one is impossible to remove from my laptop  im a computer professional and ive not been able to detach the cable took it to the hardware support at work and they cant remove it and wont try harder because it might break the connectorcheap china ripoffs sold by amazon and not a rd party
i ordered  of the  blue cables and  of the  black cables
the black cable was clearly the cables to go product but not the others
argggghhhhhthe picture is clearly a lime green or light green cable what you get is a ugly dark green
beware this is not the product you will get they really need to correct this pictureconnectors fail to hold fast
had to keep plugging and unplugging to keep internet connection
will have to replace locallyunlike many other bad reviews mine say cables to go on them so i think theyre legit
however the connectors rarely make a good connection
theyre too loose they just float around in the ports on my netgear gs switch
often i have no connectivity sometimes i have  mbps if i wiggle them just right but rarely  mbps
other cables work just fine
these are horriblethe one star is not for the cables themselves but for the misrepresentationlet me preface this with im having a bad amazon weeki have ordered many of cablestogo cables in the past
this is not one of them
at best ill call it a knockoff
cablestogo cables are packaged in cablestogo packaging  have a distinct look to them
they do have a similar end termination to them however they are not what they are described to be
alsothere was an original label on the packaging that was covered up by an avery selfprint label with the words cablestogo on it
under that label is the real label stamped made in china
cablestogo are made in ohioi ordered two  ft cables and one  ft cable in this order none of them are cablestogo brand
in fact the  ft cable is a different brand all together this one with no disguise packaging but same overlay label and is not terminated the same way
it has the little cup shaped snagless cover over the plug release which makes it very difficult to unplug the cable
lastly all three cables are rated mhz not mhz to bootnow you may be saying wow this complaint is petty
and it is very possible that these are good cables
i see it as false advertisementi have had more issues with merchandise and amazon customer service on this order  item order than i have ever had period
i drop thousands of dollars a year at amazon and have always been treated well and got what i was promised  of the time
i hope this is just amazon having a bad day i feel everyone deserves a second chance so i will readdress the issues with customer service and hope amazon steps up and makes it rightthe cable i recieved was packed in a clear plastic bag with made in china stamped on it
no where on the package nor on the cable itself is the cables to go name found
why should i pay for cables to go brand and not recieve the cables to go product sorry amazon its on its way back on your dime update   i tried again for a cables to go brand and once again recieved a generic cable this time it was in a plastic ziplock baggie amazon whats going on
i needed the cable and it did seem like a good quality one but who knows
anyway i used it and it does workupdate   ok so i needed another section of wire and thought the other cables i received which were not cables to go were good enough
i ordered from the exact same link as the previous two orders and guess what this time i received the real deal amazon actually sent me the real cables to go cable
it came in a bag marked cables to go and it had the brand name on the cable and logo on the plugthe cables to go brand is clearly better in terms of quality  i dont get how one out of three times i actually recieved what i orderedi ordered one of these with several other cables but when i opened the box it wasnt therehey cables to go would you mind sending me the little cable i ordered
i sent you a message about it and you never answeredonce you use these cables to go patch cables you will never go back
they are the best
very robust
update buyer beware even if purchasing through amazoni have been sent fake chinese knockoffs of these cables from amazon
they have a totally different boot not cables to go logo or marking different color clear packaging but the same part number
i have contacted cables to go twice and they seem helpful but tell me they will get on it and have not got back to me
i have sent them pictures showing differences and all the details
i dont know what is going on here but be warned
i purchased through amazon directlynot a different distributor
i even ordered the same cable but different length in the same order and the other length was correct
amazon sent me replacements after contacting them but they were the same
please see my email below which was sent to cable to go twice
i will upload pictures on the main amazon page for these cablesthank youhello
i have purchased many of your cat snag less patch cables in the past
on my recent order i ordered some cat snag less  foot blue and cat snag less  foot blue
the  is completely different
physically  the color the package there is not cables to go marking on the cable
i called amazon and they told me they cant do anythingas far as escalating until they replace them once and they come wrong again
i did request replacements already but i am sure they will come wrong again
the cables seem to be a copy of your cable but obviously are not very the same
the package is the same size and the bar code label is exactly the same
please see attached order and pictures showing the two different cables on the order
after looking at the amazon page for the cables i also noticed they show a different image of a cable when the  is selectedthe ones i received were correct though and the correct image of the 
the ones i received were wrong as shown belowthe cables seem rather basic and work well except one problem
after installing these in multiple locations i have found that they are almost impossible to remove without damaging the port
the release mechanism doesnt work
i have tried every which way to get them out without damage and it is next to impossibleso if you use these anticipate that it is a permanent installationi thought it would be a good idea to buy a cable this short to reduce the cable clutter behind my desk
unfortunately i was wrong
these are just too short to be usableeither cablesgo has begun rebranding cheap chinese cables made by cabletech technologies or thesmartdigital is sending out fakesgenerics
this cable had a full plastic boot and wasnt what i ordered
back it goesi had seen other reviews that this product was not a cables to go product so i made sure i ordered directly from amazon and not one of their other sellers
boy was i ticked when i received a cabletech cable in a bag with a cables to go label placed over the original label
it does not have the signature cables to go connectorsboots
i could have saved a couple bucks by ordering from one of the other sellers and gotten the same cable or maybe even the correct cable
this cable may be just fine but it was not what was advertised and what i paid for
shame on amazoni had just ordered two  ft cables to go cables from amazon and they are actual cables to go products
the quality is obviously better than this cablealthough these may be fine quality they are not what i was expecting to receivethey are advertised as cables to go ctg cat  patch cables and what i received is not a ctg product
they are made in china maybe ctg are too no brand name on the package and are definitely not in a ctg package as i also ordered  foot cables at the same time and those are in ctg bagsbeware that you may not get cables to go brandreceived  foot cables rather than the  foot cables which i ordered
also i have ordered these from amazon before and i dont think they are cables to go products that shopcloseouts shipped
the have different snag protectors and are different looking cables which are much rougher because the outer covering seems thinner which is causing bulges from the wiring inside
i have been ordering from amazon since they opened in  and this is one of the first times that i did not get what was described from amazon or an amazon marketplace seller
very disappointedcables to go confirmed via phone that all their cables are labeled either on the poly bag or on the cable
this is a generic madeinchina cable
a reviewer of another cable from citi had the same comment  that they substituted a generic cable for a namebrand one
contacted citi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable
the poly bag is long gone and the cable was for an outofstate friend
if you want a cables to go brand cable buy elsewhere
if you want a generic cable where the shipping charge is half the cost of the cable buy this onebought  and both of them ended up with broken ends
these are very poorly put together
ive never had this problem with factory made cables before and ive been buying these since the early si purchased a cables to go cable
at least that was the description on amazon
i have multiple cables from cables to go so i know what they look like and i know what their packaging looks like
hohertz technologies llc was the party who supplied the cable and neither the cable nor the packaging they sent me was from cables to go
amazon needs to start policing and punishing these sellers who substitute generic junk for genuine products
i will never purchase anything from hohertz technologies llc againi guess one out of three isnt that bad but this cable would only pass traffic at  mbs versus  gbs
the other two worked finewhen i got this cable in the mail it was not a cablestogo cable but a cheap generic
im going to try it but if it doesnt work ill be returning it
avoid cables n wireless their price is low because they cheat youupdate after pulling the cable and hooking up the equipment it does work satisfactorily so i wont be sending it backcables ordered from dus are not cables to go cables they are cable master cablescables to go cables are  star cables cable master cables are an unknown to me currently using them but prefer the peace of mind that comes with cables to go which is why i ordered theseamazon needs to work on ensuring third party sellers are actually selling what they claim to becable master are a noticeably lower quality than cables to go
hopefully they will serve me well but i must give this  star because of the deception and incorrect received item
price was too low to go through the effort of returning which is most likely the goal of dusi bought this product on december  and till now it doesnt worki urge all customers to never buy this product from this brand because although its expensive its useless
dont waste your moneyfound this cable on a box stored in home bring them back out and contacted cablestogo customer service live chat
the guy there was of so much help
i think the instructions were erroneous
the cable finally worked
when istalling the drivers do not hook the cable until the installation is finished then it will worki bought this to update my escort passport radar detector
the description says that it is a data cable but the escort program can only read info from the deviceit cannot send data to itvery poor item
the connectorsmake intermittentcontace i have to hold them just so to ensurethat it works
spring for the extra  andbuy a better cableit drops the signal to my alfa adapter this seems to be poorlydesigned
apparently it is not able to handle the voltageit was not worth it to me to spend the money to ship it back
i would not purchase this againtried using this for two ext drives a gb and a gb wd mypassport essentialit does not work at all
i have windows xp sp
when using the short usb cable provided by wd the ext drives are recognized but not when using this cablewhen i plug it in it asks for a driver software
i already researched this andit does not need one just plug and playdid i get a bad cable copy or is it not compatible 
not sure
all i know is thatit does not work using this cablethe cable they sent me had no resemblence to the cable on tahis page
the only sililarity was that it was black
i am reordering  but my confidance in them is not great at this pointdo not buy this product
it does not work
i tried it to connect pc with western digital external hard drive  does not work
does not matter xp or windows  because tried on two pc
they replaced product  same issue
for return you have to pay sh charges will call amazon to let them knowi tried to use the cable to send information from my pc to my haas cnc mill and haas cnc lathe
the cable did not work
i had to buy a serial db card
this emulation cable did not work
bewarei had to waste  of more than  cable as they failed to work properly
no error was detected by cable tester
however on connection to pc this cable was unable to connecte to net
small length cables upto  working fine
as three peices of cables between  is failed to work i used a readymade  cable from radio shack to hook the computer and it worked well
further all cables i made from this bundle whcich is less than  works flowless strange but true poor quality cableive cut a foot  and foot  attached connectors brown green blue orange as per straight config and confirmed with stock cables i have  tested positive withvictsing network lan ethernet phone telephone cable toner wire tracker tracking system  testerhowever only theft works functions
the foot  does not function
i can only assume a low quality conductor is used in these cables compromising long distance capability
the tester only verifies continuity and not capacitance inductance or resistance which all contribute to characteristics of a conductorso far i have yet to find one of these cases that will latch closed
the previous brand of slim cases i bought are much betteri ordered these disk carriers having used up my supply of similar cases
these new cases break when i open them so far two out of three
hinge breaks off
my previous ones look about the same but none brokethe case is to flimsy to protect the dvds or cds
hard to shut
items tend to fall out
i can buy the same thing at the dollar store
they do not work eitheri purchased  of these cables
lines scrolling down the screen from top to bottom on both
if it was just a defective cable it would be just one of the two
both had them
 works fine from same company but not 
returning the the product shipped did not appear to a tripp lite cable
some of the pins were unconnected
it also did not support x resolution like my foot and foot vga cables doi recently ordered two of these cables
one of the cables worked well on a  lcd display
however the other cable did not work on my  lcd display  x 
on that lcd the cable caused color and resolution problems that made the display unusable
when i substituted another brand of cable riteav vga cable with mm audio   ft the display errors were solvedive been working with monitors and cables for almost  years
this without a doubt is the worst one ever
really strong ghosting any screen object had three or four echoes beside it
text was unreadable
the cheezy little cable that came with my monitor works better than thisjust as an aside the cable looks completely different from the one in the photo
perhaps the good reviews here were for another modelthis is the worst cable i have seen in many years
even at  x  the ghosting is hard to live with
at  x  the ghosting is intolerable except for brief intervalsjust got it today
really needed a longer cable because i put my monitor on an arm httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbliydzrefohdetailsosiieutfpsc
got it plugged in and thought id better put my glasses on to see this more clearly  then i realized my glasses were on
very blurry
can i give it a zero
turns out i guess you should read the fine print
this cable is only for vga resolution
if you need higher you have to use httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbiegkrefgnocarttitleieutfpscsmidabclwhpstvpreceived this cable on time
plugged cable into monitor and computer and behold all the pictures were shaky and badly pixelating
this did not work for me i had to change back to my normal cable and shorten the distance between my pic and monitor until i find another cable that will worki bought these and after putting on my first cable i noticed that the cables would not stay plugged in
the are too cheap and the plastic lever is not strong enough to hold them in
so i sent them back and got some others that worknot sure what the issue was but the bag of connectors that i received had a label other than tripp lite and i think the quantity was different might have been more but the connectors dont clip in very well
cheaply molded i suppose
they were cheap enough that i didnt bother with returns i presume the issue was with the seller trying to move cheap partsthese plugs are slightly too wide
i tried them on several computers and found that they cant be fully inserted in about half of them and on the other half they do seat but its a very tight fit
they are also too wide to fit into the ports on a netgear gs switch
unless you want to spend time filing your connectors down you dont want theseits difficult to know if the poor manufacturing of the product i received the n is unusual or not
one rj ethernet cable fits very snugly into one side of the connector but no rj could ever fit into the smallercutout on the other side of the connector
im very surprised  this sort of thing has not happened before
btw this is a metalcovered connector most  that ive seen in the past just look plasticthey have it listed as  per cable
of course if you change the color or size the price goes all over the place
no where near 
now i only need the  foot in yellow so you would think this wouldnt be an issue
however biddealco only has one of them in stock
big shock i guess
amazon where even the worst companies on earth can make money
i have used tripp lite cables and i have never had an issue
just be careful who you do business withbe careful if ordering the advertised tripp lite u usb certified gold ab device cable  ft from clearavthat is certainly not what they sent to me
they are aware of the mistake in the listing but never contacted me before shipping my order to let me know that wasnt what i was gettingim very disappointed with amazon and with this producthow am i to verify that these jewel cases are really imation brandnot marked as imation in any waythey look and feel like plain old generic jewel cases that one would pay  for  of them  just like i didthe product is presented as a case of  imation jewel cases well a case of  is  groups of  unmarked jewel cases each group with a flimsy piece of plastic around it with the  groups placed in a everyday brown cardboard box with no packing material
that box is forwarded from an outfit named one stop to an amazon outlet to be combined with the rest of my amazon order
when amazon packed the total order they used packing material so ill assume that the four i did not check all  broken jewel cases were broken during the trip from one stop to amazoni am going to keep the product these are the type of jewel cases that i would expect for the price i paid for them so i got what i paid for not what was presented
if something is too good to be true if amazon or one stop would care to prove to me that the jewel cases i received are really imation jewel cases i will be more than happy to change this reviewi did not listen to the people that told me it would not work and i regret it
i should of listened but i can only blame myself take my warning and find something elsethis item was wired incorrectly and as such damaged the ps input to my system
i notified the seller to no avail
amazon informed me id recieve a refund for the cost of the cable thanks amazon
but i still have a damaged motherboard that was just purchased a few months agoi have an asus motherboard that contains a dual function ps connector instead of a separate connector for the mouse and separate connector for the keyboard
this splitter will not work for that function
you need an active splitter that has some electronics in it to produce a pair of working connections
while the startech is made well it is not suitable for this kind of applicationitem did not work at all was cheep but useless
got it on time kinda like getting a bucket of prop wash does no gooddoesnt allow most motherboards to work like this
check your motherboard design to see if yours is one of about  that doesi bought this cable to connect my hp laptop to my sony hdtv
im not sure if there is some kind of compatibility issue but it will not send a signal to my tv
other cables in my house work so the problem is not the ports on my laptop or tvi got the  cable and the display quality is much worse than that of my  year old  kvm cable
i wanted shorter cable without the bulk of the kvm cable i was using im only using it for the monitor connection
but the quality is very poor at x
everything is fuzzy
it earned one start because it does workjust not wellps i bought my cable from the seller dusim sure the advertised startech cable wouldve worked but apex products decided to send me a cheap low qualityuseless cable that cant even handle high resolution cable
dont buy from apex productsthere is nothing good to say about this cable
i read the reviews and hoped for the best since it has more good than bad
i hooked it up today to my laptop using my hdtv as a projector and there are scan lines on the picture that wont go away i tried screwing the cable into the back of the tv rather than just plugging it in
checked the connection between the laptop and the cable
everything was fine
this cable sucks
do not buythere is no point in sending it back because i dont want to pay for shipping
i got screwed out of 
will never buy from westronics inc againheavy cable that i use to hook up my laptop to a hdtv
no interferance with other electronics picture was clear for  months
then picture turned yellow
thats right picture had a yellow tint that would not go away
replaced this vga wire and picture is perfect
there is no external damage to the wire so sometime inside the loom must have come apart
the heaviness of the wire disguises  the poor qualityhave an older computer with no hdmi
maybe its time to get an hdmi graphics card
been running with a  foot vga cable into x with no problem
got this one and it has ghosting
maybe it will work for some people just not mei tried this cable with different monitors and lost the windows  seeing the monitor as plug and play
also the native monitor resolution is not availble
it works with some resolutions
i wish i passed on this
you should toopurchased this product and two weeks later it took a crapstopped functioning no way of telling if the cable is good untill you buy it and have it connected and used it for awhiletried this cable with two different laptops mac and pc and two different monitors lcd computer monitor and hdtv
did not work with any of them
by the time i figured out it was the cable that was the problem and not my computer settings it was too late to return it
do not buystay away from this vendor if you dont give him five stars you will get nasty emails from him
this man went so far as to go to amazon and have my fair review removed
hes dirty pool im waring you
the product is inferior you do not get what is in the picture eitherbought two of these cables last week for a tradeshow in las vegas
wanted to connect the laptop to a hdtv  all went well with the first one
then i hooked up the second one and the color was all screwed up
i messed with the laptop and the tv for two hours before swapping the cables
yep  the cable was bad
try to find one of these on short notice in las vegas for a tradeshow
should have bought something of higher quality  where is the quality controli could not make my computer display my monitors native resolution with this cable
i connected the monitor with my old short cable and the resolution was fine
a pin was missing from both connectors   i dont know if this was the source of the problemi bought this cord to hook my computer up to a lcd display
i also experienced serious ghosting of images on my sony lcd display
when i use back the previous cord everything is fine
no ghosting of images
i am going to return the cord and i will update my review if i receive a better onei bought this cable so i could connect my garmin etrek h gps to a usb port instead of the serial port it came with
this setup does not work so i am very disappointed with my purchasesuppose to be prolific chipset but the drivers would not install properly tried in  laptops and they alll showed exclamation mark by the device when you looked at it in device manager
downloaded new drivers from prolific and same thingits not woirth sending back because even if  iget my money back the cost of shipping is more
the seller is a rip off and the product doesnt workpurchased to update firmware on my harman kardon avr and avr
this was recommended cable by hk so i purchased it
after down loading the drivers from startech cable and beginning update process on the receiver i received upload failed message
tried multiple times using  different laptops
two running xp and one win
finally contacted customer support
after  minutes in chat session the support analyst stopped responding to any of my chat notes
finally got frustrated and closed chat
cable does not work and service is terrible will not purchase startech cables in futurei had it working on win   then it stopped working and now no matter what i try it doesnt work
dont waste your timei am stationed in afghanstan and almost always reply on customer reviews when buying products from amazoncom
somehow i didnt read the reviews on this cable and bought it
when it arrived there was no cd or any type of software
this review will look fairly identical to many other reviews
two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful
even worse one reviewer explained there were only drivers in china that work and displayed a link but amazon doesnt allow embedded links
they decided to give us the executable name
i did a googlebing search and  go to download sites which require spyware to be downloaded first
the other  see this as a virus
i suggest returning the cable before you open the package as i did
dont try to download plprolificgpsallinoneexe
in conclusion this product is absolutly useless with windows  do not buy thisi hope this helps and good luck finding a better cable
i am currently searching myselfim not too techsavvy but this will not fit my pc
incorrect dvi type
i went with the  amazonbasics hdmi to dvi instead to get my pc hooked up to my tv
i later learned that i need a  dvi adapter this does not say whether or not it is  or 
but it is the latter in case anyone was wonderingi have an intel dhgd motherboard which has a dvii output
this adapter would not output a signal to a samsung thd monitor
all i get could ever get was a blank black display
i was hoping it would work with my motherboard but i kindof expected it not to work
in the past on other computers i found that unless the manufacturer includes an adapter as part of the included accessories the chances that a third party adapter would work is pretty slimi was sort of surprised this did not work since it should have been compatible with all dvi specificiations eg
singledual link dvid and singledual link dviiupdate  my display samsung thd has a dvid port
this adapter is a dvii
dvii and dvid are incompatible
the item description does indicate which your buying
but let it be known the adapter being shipped is a dviititle says it all doa luckily i actually didnt even need it to do what i was aiming to accomplishit didnt work for me
though in its defense i was using it via an automatic switch box
i didnt delve in it for too long
ill try it again at another timei had to look this up to find out why it wouldnt fit my pc docking station or monitors
i could see there were  extra pins in there and i finally found someones comment saying they just removed the extra pins and it worked finenot on this onethey made the ground pin extra wide guaranteeing that it is completely useless
disgusted with this whole situation
the cost of a return and refund have not yet been investigated but i needed the thing today and i am out of luckselling this as just a dvi adapter is quite frankly dishonest or at the very least incompetent
terrible experiencei must have gotten a faulty one because it doesnt work
ive tested my cables and they work fine so something is up with the adapter
at least it was only  that i wastedtotally different from the picture they show very low quality i will never buy from them again and it arrive  day laternever could get this adapter to work
have used other brands of adapters with no problems but this one just flat wouldnt worki did not expect much and i guess thats good but i got nothing as far as video pass through on this
it make sense cuz one signal is digial and the other not  but why sell something that doesnt work
too cheap to even bother returning maybe thats the marketing slant on thisthe picture on his item is misleading
i was looking for a  pin cable such as the one pictured on this page but when it arrived it had  pins
ive contacted this seller several times to exchangereturn it but after a few email runarounds theyve stopped contacting me
i still dont have a digital cable for my monitori installed the cable and had problems with a dvd rw drive
i installed a flat standard cable that came with an old motherboad that i had on hand and it works fine
i guess i got a bad cablelike another reviewer posted the cable seems pretty cheaply made
the labelspullers are made from paper with some kind of white backing
when my cable arrived this backing had hardened and started to disintegrate resulting in tiny little snow like flakes all over the cable
definitely do not want to be putting that inside a case

bought a  and a  both the same
purchased better quality cables for lt in the past
buyer bewarethe cable seems pretty cheaply made

buyer bewarei guess i got what i paid for
the cable works but it only produces a black and white image on my tv
oh well not much  spentthe labels simply dont stick
after a couple days at best the labels will begin to peel away
definitely substandard adhesivei bought these to use with my dymo label printer
the labels print fine but the adhesive on these labels is terrible
it adheres only for a short time and then starts peeling away
i dont know about other dymo letratag labels but these are uselessi wont even use these if the cd or dvd is going to be used by my husband or anyone else with little patience
this is such a tight fit you are going to get finger prints all over your cd while trying to get it in and out of this sleeve
someone with especially little patience might even break the cd while trying to force it in
also it is double sided so when you put the second cd in the other side that side of the sleeve crinkles up
it seems well enough made so i would have given it four stars if the cds fit in more easily
i dont feel like returning this so ill just use it as a single sleeve for cds only i listen to occasionallyi opened the package and the tabs fell off of  of the cases opened  cases and they also lost there tabsjunkmost were broken on arrival
had to be returned
they were discontinued so i went with verbatim cases and had no problems at allwhat can you say about cd cases
these would be adequateif they hadnt arrived damaged
whoever does the packing for amazon should learn that a single sheet of brown paper will not prevent shipping damage
a little bubble wrap may be more expensive but it would have prevented my returning this order for a refundi purchased one of these models recently after determining that the kvms which work off soft keys are too flaky and unreliableinitially the unit worked fine so i agree with most of the positive comments posted by other reviewers
i did notice a lag of perhaps five to ten seconds before the mouse would unfreeze when switching to the newer of my two pcs but never regarded it as a problem because i switch between the two infrequently
if you switch between pcs more often you may regard that as an issue howeverthe problem is that when a recent snowstorm hit my area causing the electrical power to go up and down several times the usb switching functionality got burned out
bear in mind that this unit needs to be left powered on  and i was asleep when it happened and i had only been using it for a few weeksmy two pcs which contain many more sensitive silicon chips than this little kvm made it through the power problems fine which makes me suspect that the kvm was not engineered robustly enough
it runs off a small external power supply and really shouldnt be so prone to burn out
we all have homes full of chipbased gadgets that handle power cutoffs without incidentcurrently i am searching for a completely passive ie unpowered kvm setup that wont be so touchy
i may buy an old ps kvm on the cheap and use usb adapterstry googling the phrase kvm burn out and youll see how common this problem is
its the usb switching that burns out  the simpler and more robust vga functionality stays intact but is not much use by itselfi had good success with this device on my older dell latitude laptop
however under windows xp on my newer thinkpad tp this device can be flakey depending upon exactly what you are doing with itin particular at  baud using zmodem the device tends to retry packets and sometimes fail completely
other times it has yielded a windows blue screen causing the pc to reboot
this behavior is not restricted to port comcom ie renaming the default serial port or not makes no difference in the bad behaviorive tried many other noname usbtoserial dongles including a number that use the prolific usbtoserial comm port driver and all tend to give similar bad behavior especially with highspeed zmodem transfers to an embedded linux systemthe only exception so far has been the keyspan usahs which has been flawless with the thinkpad tp under all conditions
it includes the ability to configure and selftest the usb device allowing one to tune the serial port transfer parameters to maximize throughput
it also has much larger fifo queuesalso configurable
its only drawback is its package size which is much larger than dictated by the electronics it enclosesthese things are designed to emulate legacy pc serial portsbut not all of them are up to that taskand clearly this is one of thembest regardsbruce d lightnerlightnerlightnernetcannot make it work with windows xp
tried several documents on the iogear website on how to make it work but it simply fails when attempting to use it with simple serial devicesio gear is clueless and offers me no help
if the led is on theyre happy
this does not work under os x  on an intel imac
cant say about any other macs
the io gear package says os x is supported wrongdont waste you time on this many other os x users are happy with  a keyspan usahsdidnt work on os x mountain lion and lion
installed the latest driver
it simply does not work
tried it under a linux vm
works a little but very unreliably
bought two others from different manufacturers both worked fine on linux and os x with no issues whatsoeverthis isnt just a case of a bad unit
i bought two from different stores and both failed to function
just not a good product basically
dont bother buyinggo with either the plugable sic unit or any unit based on the ftdi chipset
they both work fine on maclinuxi use these to putyou knowa cd or dvd of photos into a bubble mailer and send off
the client doesnt want a jewel case
just drop it into an envelope he says
so i buy some of these and the box is in perfect shape
nice crisp professional
and i open the box and inside is the tightest smallest strongest elastic i have ever seen totally creasing and wrinkling these little envelopes
not the biggest problem in the world
and my client was casual
but does memorex have to make it look like i am sending out disks in en envelope i found under my desk
find better packaging idiotsthe biggest flaw in these cases is that they dont close completely
only one side clicks shut leaving the other side freely open
this means the case has an easier chance of unintentionally being opened when you pick them upthese discs are typical of most memorex products in that the quality is fairly lowthe funny and somewhat sad thing is these cases solve the problem of memorexs dual cd cases
yet memorex wont employ this solution to the double cases
these single slim cd cases have a ring button in the center to hold the discs in the cases
the double cd cases use toothed pegs to hold the discs in
these teeth constantly break off when youre removing the discs from the cases
ring buttons solve this problem
and its possible to make double cd cases this way as office depot used to make a brand that did this
philips cdrs were also sold in similar double cases at one point
memorex and by extension maxell just dont want to spend a few extra cents to make a batch of discs with ring buttons because they use more plastic
yet memorex will use them in single slim cd cases
go figurei didnt receive what i had ordered
i received a cardboard box of knock off jewel cases
not only that but a good bit of them were brokeni got a surprise when i open the box and found the slim cddvd jewel cases i ordered were completely damaged at the bottom of the box
the package itself was undamaged
it looked as though they were already damaged before they were placed in the box
since they were christmas presents i had to go out and buy some new onesbreaks and cracks easily
too thin for protection of dvd
flimsy and poorly made for shipping through the mail they will get cracked in shipping
hard to openi have some old memorex slim cases and i cant believe how bad these are by comparison
the cover doesnt lock closed the cd doesnt stay locked in and  of the first  were broken
they weight half as much and are barely half as good
i would never buy these againwant a pile of cheap cracked cd cases
ya know memorex i did plan on putting my inserts in the case as well
its like clock work trying to open one of these up with out it crackingfirst off its bulky so it wont fit in my dual pcmia slot if i am using another pcmia card at the same time
second if you are going to use this device with an ipod you need to buy the power cord not included for this device
otherwise it does not provide enough power to interact with your ipodnot worth the pricei had both the  first which had some features i was not happy with but i thought the  with the  mp was the way to improve on it
definitely not
at night it looked like there were ufos behind me
even when standing perfectly still lights came out as streaks in the background
printed pictures were not great and most photos taken were blurryin the end i got the sony cybershots i ordered two of these
i like the one in the picture because you do not have to worry about big plug ins taking up  of the strip
however i did not receive the one that is described
i received two totally different protectors
but instead of taking the time to return it im keeping and  using them
the one i receive works but they are the normal kind that if you have a big plug its going to cover up other plugs that will not be able to useit came busted
very disappointing
the first time that amazon did this to me
i didnt bother returning ithad an arc jump from this unit while i was attempting to plug a component in
i thought that i was going to fry my dvd playerdo not buy this if you want to use it with a sharp zaurus  if you check the zaurus newsgroups youll find that this card does not work with that great little pda
it will mount once then if you turn the machine off or eject the card it will never be mountable again
its not clear if this is a problem with the sd card or the zaurus but it is clear you should use a different brandcan only store about  meg then it will claim that storage is full
waiting for a replacement nowcouldnt perform a standard backup procedure with my e
called toshiba said sandisk was not recommended
i tried a lexar sd card no problems
backup worked fine
i will no longer buy sandiski started using these cards a few months ago
bought two of them
they were a lot cheaper than those from lexar simple etc
however you get what you pay fori first found out how bad these cards are when i bought a sharp zaurus
apparently sandisk does something funky in the hardware on these cards that keeps them from behaving like everyone elses cards
whatever they have done keeps it from working on the zauruswhile looking through some other products here  i am now seeing that they are not working on things such as the toshiba e which i also own
the card seemed to work on mine but only half way
i had been attributing problems to the pc os on it
turns out i was a bit mistakenso if you can get this card to work in your device good luck to you
if you cant get rid of the card and buy something from another manufacturerbought one of these and it was defectiveafter calling sandisk and spending  minutes giving all the info to some representative in fla was told they would be back to me in  days
after hearing nothing from them for about  days even with another phone call i finally got an email from their customer service
too late as i dumped this card at a loss and went with lexar a company whose memory has held up well for me
as far as sandisk goes cheap prices but you end up paying later if you ever need supportthis is the first dv camcorder ive bought
its size appealed to me and it seemed to get great reviews online
at first i liked it only being a bit dissapointed in the grain you get in anything except for very bright outdoor scenes
a few months later i had to send it in for repair because it started recording a few pixels as constant red
this was very distracting and pretty much ruined any  picture
i was told the repairs would take  weeks
they took a month and a week but at least i got it back fixed
it worked fine for another year when suddenly it became a very expencive doorstop
it started when i put in a tape and got a remove this cassette error
a few more tries left me with a camcorder that wont even close anymore
it just beeps and spits out any tape i put in it
i cant even close it without a tape in it
i searched for this online and found hundreds of people complaining about the same problem
it seems like this camera only has about a  year lifespan
other canon cameras seem to suffer from the same problem
im really upset about having spent so much money on something that didnt last a reasonable amount of time
do your research before you buy thisnone of the plugs fit
this was a waste of money
now i dont know what i should do with itset adapter to identical specs as the adapter i was trying to duplicate
did not work
tried with two other items a battery charger and an answering machine set specs accordingly using the correct adapter prong and would not work with eitheri love these for powering various random rarely used or found electronicsspecs area wide range of voltages including       or  volts dc with a maximum current load of ma
look around and youll find ma units for lesscheck your device for power requirements
no worry about a higher powered unit burning out your device your device will only use the amperage that it needs but take care in the voltage settingwhere are the voltage current and power specs 
theres no good excuse for the vendor not to clearly state these specsi bought these hoping that they would help me work in a room with a tv playing by listening to music
they were totally ineffective
the noise canceling feature was just noticeable ie
there was a barely detectable difference between on and off
but the frequency response was poor  almost no upper register which made listening to music hardly bearable even with tv off
i returned them for creditvery disappointed
as others have noted this is not a  system as normally meant by  system  which is  discrete separate channels
instead its just stereo or   sure it has  speakers including a sub but it does not take  input but only stereo input so your  sound card is not put to good use
its simulated surround derived from stereo signal sent to rear speakers
also hisses when offjust got these and set them up
very dissappointed
i bought them because my old cheapo koss speakers were dying
i never thought the koss sounded particularly good but these are much worse
im not an audiophile  not picky at all my goal was just to find something affordable and decentsounding for playing trance mps in the background while i work
these are not what i was looking for
the stereo imaging is good but thats the only good thing i can say about them
the highs arent crisp at all and the bass quotthumpsquot  but not in a good way
itd hard to describe but to me it sounds like a cardboard box
not enjoyable and quite distractingi order this for my gazm motherboard ive been buying ram for this pcfor several years
ive been using pcs for over  yearsi ordered it through emartbuythe ram was shipped in a soft plastic bag no hard plastic enclosurei ran it through memtest and lots of errors showed up right out of bagmore errors than the stick i am trying to replace that was in use for  years
and it failed the memtest twice thats a first for mei contacted emartbuy sent the memory back
their replies shocked me theyclaimed they tested it before they shipped and they tested again after they got the return and the memory still worksi cant say about other vendors thats selling this productdont buy from usa emartbuy these are not honest peoplei dont know what is wrong
this mouse is jittery and difficult to control
back it wentdont waste your money the product is still in its infancy
it is made of cheap plastic batteries which it consumes faster than cheese are hard to replacethe response of the mouse is poor and lags as you move it around
it doesnt know how to accelerate properly
and if the signal goes out of sync with the base unit you can expect frustration getting them to talk to each other
stick to a wired optical mouseinstalled and worked immeadiately 
until it died  minutes laterthe winxp device manager shows it is installed and working properly but it no longer controls the cursor
uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem nor did changing channels
what could possibly be the problem with these thingsi purchased these cables as an addon item to replace some mono cables i was using but were causing ground loop hum and static feedback from my external audio interface and speaker set up on my multimedia workstation
im not normally a fan of having to spend more than i need on cables as they have little impact on the overall quality in the signal chain so went with thesewhen i initially plugged them in they seemed to alleviate the problem but within seconds the problem persisted again and even worsened
when i went to investigate what the problem was id find that as soon as any pressure was applied near the connectors that the signal would cut out or produce lots of static which indicated to me the internal wires were not well shielded and that the strain relief at the jack was not well designedoverall id have to recommend that you stay away from these cables
for mere dollars more i fared much better with the monoprice cables which feature gold plated jacks and a proper strain relief spring design at the connectorsthanks to these speaker wires i had a headache running back and forth to the stereo shop trying to figure out what was wrong with my door speakers after installation static noise and after  trips these rca cables were found to be the root of the problem after only being  days old
ended up purchasing jl audio rca cables insteadcheap
junkthe title say it all really
just that simple
the cable feels nice and durable except for one small problem
red channel works and white is utterly dead
no signal
buy at your own riskthese are not hosa brand cables
i bought  thinking that they would be hosa brand
they are not
its like you bought a mercedes and they deliver a ford fiesta
now ford makes a pretty good car but it aint no mercedesmy fear is that the inner wires are not properly shielded
i will guarantee that a genuine hosa cable like the one pictured on the vendors page will perform better than this onei know that for most users the cable they foist on you instead of the hosa will be adequate for the job but i do this stuff for a living my cables take a beating and i insist on buying quality stuff because it pays off by being less intermittent and in many cases sounding better than cheap chinese crapbuyer beware
i wrote the vendor this morning
no response
no email as amazon has promised
the photograph of the product is a lie
this is false advertising and in a way stealing from every one of you who bought this misadvertised productsecond edit to addi dont know what happened to my first edit
thru an amazon website error when i click on the cables i bought im now told jr music sells these
ive no beef against jr music only cmple the dishonest outfit that defrauded meplease contact jr music before buying to insure that these are actually hosa cmr cables
now hosa aint the best but they are decent rugged and properly priced
please do not accept a substitution or you may well hear the difference or have issues with intermittent connections on both ends but especially at that damned stereo mini connector
heck once i recover from being mad at cmple i may just buy from jr musicthank you one and all for reading thisthird edit to add  june  i still dont understand how this website works
now when i check my review yet another vendor claims to sell these cables
all the info is the same including their likely purposeful mislabeling of the product number
according to hosa this is a cmr
leave out the dash and it is tough to find them on the innertubes and even on hosas own website
hosa brand cables of this type are distinctive in their orange and gray color codes and their nice leftright cable labelsplease contact whoever the vendor of the day is for these cables and have them insure to you that you will be getting genuine cmr cables or you will likely be getting bait and switched alsoso in conclusion please stay away from cmple
they had their chance to make this right by simply doing the right thing and sending me exactly what i paid for
i shall continue to rail against those thieves until they comply
but the problem may well go beyond the dishonest bums at cmple
it could be that if you buy the cables in the picture that another merchant may pull the same crap
i hope that this is not the case but i have no way of knowing since amazon seems to have a totally hands off  policy regarding bait and switch and they refuse to be communicative in this matter
but hey they have every right to conduct business in this manner and hat is off to amazon for allowing me to write repeated reviews of cables here on their website to warn other customers about bait and switch and the potential problems of using inferior cablingthanks again for reading this diatribe and three cheers for amazon
they may not be perfect but who is
still the best online shopping experience in my booki bought this to hook up a metronome to an amp
after three short months it already stopped working
i want a refund but cant figure out how to ask for one
cheaptrust me ive tried everything from adapters to this cable to a  inch to usb cableeverything
and let me tell you this cable is no different the noise is unbearable
if you are even remotely serious about your recording dont even bother with this
does it work
yes but the noise makes the quality just bad simply
dont even botheri have the astro a wireless and there is a mm male from the xbox remote to the mm male astro mixamp to work the mic for the online chat
well i ordered this cable thinking it was a mm and get it in the male to find out its a mm i cant recall the order process but i was sure this was the right cableas stated left channel is bad at the  end
not worth paying to return ill just fix it with an end i had laying aroundthis cable failed on one channel after being only used a handful of times
disappointed and would not recommend to othersthe cable itself is fine transmits signal just fine
the plugs however seem to be undersized and not true industry specs
the mm trs plug simply falls into any hole i put it into hot dog down a hallway with no definitive click or tactile feedback that it is seated
the  ts plugs are a little better but are also loose in there respective sockets and can become scratchy if bumped
i only have the  monitors to use the  ts plugs in but i did test the mm trs plug in everything i could and its the same loose feeling
my kicker ear buds have a positive click and snap into all the same plugs and so does my super cheap  to mm male to male cord so its not my ports being loose it is this guy being too small to be adequatei primarily got this to hook a pair of studio monitors to my pc and while it does work i have to constantly check the mm end and every so often it needs to be inserted all the way again because it has slid outi was looking for mm and they turned out to 
sent em back
still looking
the ear buds to my cell phone also works with our toshiba  tv
they are not long enough and i am still looking for a comparable extensioni may be too picky or i may just have a critical ear im a musician and i wanted to use this to extend my headphone cable while recording and performing but this cable causes a noticeable sound degradation
i suppose that some degradation is to be expected over this long a cable run but ive heard much betterafter having similar trouble with a hosa right angle adaptor right out of the box hosa is simply on my personal do not buy lista commenter asked me to name a better choice and it just so happens that i recently purchased one  the answer is dimarzio  its not cheap but the difference in sound quality is like night and day
the hosa now destined for the trash is very small gauge wire and there appears to be no twisting or shielding which good audio cables need  i guess you get what you pay foraddendum  i discovered something about hosa cables at a friends studio  if you look for the hosa elite series cables they are high quality good sounding cables they cost ten times as much as these cheap throw away ones but they are actually decent sounding cables
again dont buy these cheap cables for any serious audio applications look for the the elite series and open your wallet a lot wideras long as you completely cut off the female end and solder on your own
the receptacles on these are loose and very poor quality and all you do is move and your audio drops out
i run a recording studio and have had to completely redo all  of these cables within the first week
artists complained right from the start that their headphones werent workingi suppose i could have returned them but the truth is if you want something done right do it yourselfdont buy these unless you feel like spending some time to make them workdescription needs to state the size of the adapter
not sure if the product itself is useful because i cant use it
this is the large headphone size
this will not plugin to your phone or ipodthe first one broke inside my guitar right after i first tried to take it out
the second one broke after few daysi received  to  stereo adapters not rca to  ts mono adaptersits not really worth the effort to return them i guess ill just go to radio shack to make sure that i get the correct adaptersi purchased  of these and  fell apart
i did not try the other  do not buy themi bought two and one was very loose when a  male plug is plugged into this adapter and caused noise and a short in the line
it was so loose that it was not usable
maybe i just got a bad one
but i threw them both away and went to radioshack and bought their equivalent
im a little iffy on adapters since a lot of them fail and radioshack brand is usually of very good quality so i might just run there when im in need of adapters in audio video cablingi wish i had positive feedback for this but no do not buy it i didnt think they were any different so i got this one the sound quality when using this adapter is baaad
end of discussioni received  plugs from seller and noticed the plugs are shorter than the one i have that works well
sure enough these plugs failed to make positive locking with the  female plugs
it easily pops out and lose contact
the plugs i got did not have any marking or reference to hosa
hence i dont know if they are knockoff version
regardless they are cheaply made
i am surprised that this product received so many positive review
i added a picture in the product page so you can see it for yourself
i am returning the itemsi bought  of these for use in various locations in a live production settingnone of them have outright failed however on more than half of them the female jack holds the male plus so loosely that any small force will unplug the male cable the female end of this adapterthere is no study click when you insert a male plug into the adaptermost of the adapters that have this problem were this way right out of the box
they have not be abused or overused
just not a quality item at any priceafter three short months about half of these connectors have failed to the point of being not usable
the connections no longer make contact when plugged in and there is no resistance holding in the plugi would not use these connectors in any area that i wanted to work reliablyit was just ok until it broke about three weeks in
i used it to connect my headphones to my e drum kit and it constantly came loose which was a real pain
i have used similar products since and this hasnt been an issue and they havent brokendidnt work for stereo adapterdidnt work
not worth returning
was trying to use it to use a rode videomic on a tascam dr
no dice
might work for other uses just not mineit arrived with tolerances beyond specifications and national standards it may operate with similar poorly engineered equipment
iow this unit would damage cables and their connectors
i do not use this itemvery poor quality
causes volume loss and static when installed
if you twist the connecrion you can occasionally get adequate sound quality but as soon as you bump the connection the sound volume dropsi bought  of these from jr music world in oct ive only just tried to deploy them now  and am finding that they have very poor grip
they allow the male pins to easily slide out of the female receptacleim not sure how current batches are but i would only buy these again if there were no other choicefortunately that isnt the case  there are indeed several other choices available
ive got some replacements from other brands on the wayfor  it will cost me more of my time and money to send it back than its worththe coupler itself is heavy metal ridged and looks totally badass
this is its only good part and the exact reason why i thought id get onehowever its performance and appearance are worlds apart
st off the connection isnt that great
this is not the dealbreaker though
what made me most unhappy was that the description stated stereo and its clearly mono
i even tested multiple cords headsets and etc but nope its clearly monowhats worse its not even good mono the sound quality takes a dive too
tested the sound quality using flac and mp versions of the same files
this specific coupler degrades the quality far worse than anything else ive tried in the pastdo not buy unless you want to take the chance that my unit just so happened to be a special casethis never worked on my device at all no sound
the connections were loose maybe with some electrical tape to hold the adapter to the device or outputnot sure if this is a used product or new
it was shipped with the hard plastic packaging broken like someone wanted to pull it out of the packaging to maybe test it or perhaps someone realized it was the wrong part so they tried to put it back into the packageabsolute garbage of a cable
horrible frequency interruption
i would not recommend this to anyone and i did return itfirst time i used it i noticed audio dropping out
thought it was a fluke use a second one form same company also garbage
you get what you pay for and i should have known at this price i would get garbage update   nov this stopped working for me
i threw it away
there is a much more expensive version of this item that i purchased at about the same time which works perfectlywith all my headphones
sometimes you get what you pay for
 original review i bought this to relieve the strain created on the headphone connector on my laptop
it works for a pair of audiotechnica athmfs professional studio monitor precision headphones but does not fit my fathers audiotechnica athms professional studio monitor headphoneon my fathers set athms the plug does not go fully into the female end of the hosa adaptorresults in only one channel coming through
the  radio shack adaptor does work so im inclined to believe that the hosa adaptor is out of specanyone have similar experiencesworked from a few months would intermittently cut out then went totally dead
the housing is too thick to cut into and repair the wiringi thought this was an extension cable for a twoprong electrical plug for my led television
it is not
the female end is some sort of special plug that fits something i dont ownthe x will attach to the rebel ti eos camera body ok but is not compatible with either of my canon lenses
the short instruction sheet that comes with it says its compatible only with tamron lenses and not for use with digital cameras
neither of these caveats are pointed out on the amazon webpage which says for canonmount lenses
the tamron site is worthless
in response to a similar situation by a reviewer the bh site sayson the converters product web page we say teleconverters are not recommended for lenses wider than mm eg
mm
so the  will not workin addition the customers lenses are efs lens and will not work on nonsupporting converters or older digital camera bodies
this should be on the amazon page
im having to return it
great disappointmenti opened the box and saw those descriptions were missing from the amazon product descriptionsfrom tamron manual in the box for best results use the tamron teleconverter with telephoto lenses ranging from mm to mm
when used on digital slr cameras this teleconverter is not designed for digital use
we do not guarantee its performance when used on digital slr camerasi hate when amazon says it was delivered when it wasnt
was notified it was to be delivered by sunday
uh who delivers anything on a sunday
guess ill have to wait and see if i get it tonight or by tomorrow
this is annoying when i was hoping to use it today and thats not going to happencreative mp jukeboxes sound like a great idea but they come with laughably brief warranties
creative offers a three month warranty but considering the high cost that is unacceptable
keep in mind that an mp jukebox is nothing more than a laptop hard drive in a flimsy plastic case
creative is inflexible about the warranty as i found out and considering that my nomad has failed three times i can only warn that it is a very poor investment
also a nomad is as heavy as a small brick so forget about carrying it around with you unless you want to walk with a limp
in the real world the battery life in nothing like what is advertised
have a bulk pack of extra batteries on hand
a nomad is too big to fit in your pocketliterallyso you need a carrying case and the lcd display is so small it is worthless unless your song titles are written in shorthand
as to fit and finish ive used my nomad lightly as i said its too big to carry around so it just sat on my desk at work
despite that the markings on all the button are of cheap paint and wore off after just a few months which meant i had to remember what function each button performed
if you buy one make sure to have spare copies of your mp files
nomads have a habit of losing their hard drive formatting
this means you have to reformat the nomad and reinstall everything
that can take several evenings
on the plus side the only plus i can think of the creative playcenter software that comes with a nomad is excellent but these things underperformed my lowest expectations
the satellites are thin and tinny
the subwoofer is distorted and boomy at even the lowest settingsi tried to return them but amazon considers these to be hazardous material because of the magnets so you cannot return them if you arent satisfied
however their terrific customer service folks just refunded my money including shipping and told me i can throw them away or give them to someone
since i dont know anyone i dislike enough to give these to i will throw them awaywhen it works the sound is great for the price but unfortunately my speakers failed  months into owning
because it has been  months short amount of time wouldnt you say i must deal with cyber acoustic to correct the problem
for me to get a replacement which could be a refurbished product i must mail the speakers back to them and it looks like i am on the hook for shipping charges
lets do the math
i paid  for the system and now if i want them to honor their warranty i must pay  to ship them to vancouver washington
more than  of what i paid
 speakers have now become 
i decided that its not worth it and this gave me the opportunity to see why they might have stopped working
removing three screws from the bottom of the primary front speaker i discovered that the wiring inside was damaged during assembly
they sliced the rubber protection surrounding two of the wires and this is what has caused the speakers to fail
cyber acoustics has responded to my email and i am communicating with them about the problem and will let you know if the problem is handled fairlyupdate i was contacted by cyber acoustics through email and for some reason my last reply was never answered and there has been no contact from them in a week
the review says it alli bought a brand new  lcd samsung
with it i bought this cleaner
no other cleaner had ever touched the brand new screen
after using this cleaner once with screen cooled down and so on it left streaks all over the screen that are simply impossible to remove
i tried distilled water and iklear on it to remove the streaks left by the monster product but eventhough iklear would not add any new streaks of its own it simply could not remove any of the streaks left by this monster spray
dont use this product on lcd screensupdate i hunted and hunted for solutions on how to remove the streaks
finally i found it and it worked like a charm
go buy  or higher isopropyl alcohol from the drug store
mix this with  distilled water and  by volume isopropyl  or higher purity
use two microfiber lintfree cloths
wipe gently but thoroughly with the wet cloth saturated with your  mix but not dripping then dry with a dry cloth again gently
it removed all the terrible streaks caused by the monster junk and the screen is now crystal clear and streak free
cost about  for this mixturesolution plus the cloths were from the iklear package i already hadi had high hopes for this cleaner but the sprayer would not work
when i pressed it down it would just drip out and spill on to the bottle and drip off
when i got a little on to the cloth i tried cleaning the screen
at first i thought it worked well but when it dried there were streaks
i have not had this happen with other screen cleanersafter trying a lot of other cleaners i bought this garbage
it left black sections and streaks all over the screen
i tried several sttempts following directions nad the black areas got worse
do not buy thisi figured this would be a solid product coming from monster
comes in a nice bottle and a nice big soft towel but it leaves alot of lint
the screen cleaner itself really shines up your screen and makes it look better than new damn near and makes the surface of the laptop shine
i was blown away by how well i thought it worked until i looked closer and my entire screen had lines through it never seen streaks like this they tattooed my screen up real nice like
i had to use a damp cloth with hot water and had to keep going over and over everything to get the streaks out
i had to ring out cloth and soak it in more hot water and ring it out and go over it and over it and over to get the streaks out
and guess what i had to do it again and then i had to take a dry cloth and polish it out about  times
geesh not using monster screen cleaner anymore
to much damn work to get the screen back to normal and any surface this bull crap gets onmonster me disappoint in you sonim sorry to report this product leaves streaks and considerable lintnot recommendedi have smears and a cloudy screen
holy  i spend a good sum of money for this tv and it looks like crap nowits good for cleaning eyeglasses and smart phone screens but thats itim going to attempt to contact monster for any suggestions on how to erase the mess it made on my screenfull disclosurei havent purchased this product but did buy a different screen cleaner
because of my experience and others whove had the same problems with this cleaner i thought i should share what ive learnedthe cleaner i purchased left a film  streaks on my tv and it didnt remove the fingerprints on the piano black bezel
i then found this information on samsungs website under the qa section for my tv model lnb with a matte screen although there are a number of cleaning products on the market that say they are safe for lcdplasma panel usage i recommend just using plain old purified water without any minerals and a nonabrasive cloth
purified water with out minerals will also prevent any mineral deposits to collect on the screen
mrsamsungive now cleaned my tv matte screen  laptops glossy screen with purified water wo minerals which is just distilled water and is under  for a gallon
i sprayed the water on the microfiber cloth that came with the kit i purchased not directly onto the tv
it removed the film  streaks left by the cleaner i bought without having to endlessly polish and worry that im damaging the screen and cleaned the finger prints from the piano black bezel which my cleaner failed to dosave your money and get the best cleaner distilled waterwhat was suppose to be a quick smudge removal job turned into a  minute nightmare of polishing out streaks
no i did not smudge the smudge
it was a small smudge and i figured i would clean the entire screengood thing i only cleaned a horizontal section about six inches tall
who knows maybe new screens come covered in a clear film of grease or something and this disturbed it
either way not worth the pricenot even close
i seriously doubt people are getting streakfree resultsand if they are then i guess i got a bunk batch
and for the cost
that is very unacceptable
but then again it is monter after alli will never buy this product again first bottle is enough and i am ready to trash the remaining just over half the bottleleft cloudy streaks on my tv
after trying for a few months with poor results i tried another brand and have a spotless screen
bought for the brand name will not buy againthe monster corp are the biggest con artists and scammers in the electronics business
and lol i have to admit they got me too
i bought this on a whim at a local electronics store as i needed to clean my  panasonic plasma
the salesman said this was great stuff
however he forgot to mention how overpriced monster products are
but sometimes i just like to throw my money in the street
silly me
my house is not smoke free
lots of ganja and cigarettes are smoked on a daily basis
my monitors can get pretty filmy and gunked up
you should see my wallsthis worked okay on my plasma but it left horrible streaks on my asus lcd computer monitor
just horrible
yeah yeah yeah i cleaned it while it was cooled down like the instructions said
didnt matter
ultimately i had to use distilled water to clean off the mess the monster cleaner left behind
see cleaning tip below
cleaning tip you do not need to buy these cleaners to get your monitors like new
go down to the local auto parts store and get yourself some microfiber rags
the ones you use to wash your car
you can purchase them in bundles and theyre inexpensive
buy a small  oz
spray bottle at the beauty supply or the local drug store
theyre cheap
i prefer the beauty supply store because theres usually more hot ladies there
buy some distilled water at the market
and some white vinegar if you want to get fancy
side note holding your nose and guzzling a few cups of white vinegar the night before is also a good way to pass a simple drug test
its nasty but it works
this wont help if they test your hair follicles
mix the distilled water  the vinegar into a  solution and dump it into the spray bottle
this is the really cool part because it makes you feel like a cook in a meth lab
but i promise you wont blow yourself up
just kidding
meth is bad kids
when cleaning a monitor do this while the screen is cool and dark with some natural or artificial light coming in from the side
duh
spray the mixture onto the soft side of the microfiber rag
try not to spray it directly onto your monitor
it can drip into the bottom between the screen and the bezel and cause damage
wipe in a circular motion like you do when applying wax to a car finish
wipe off the damp solution with the soft side of a separate dry microfiber rag
dont rub hard or polish your screen
this is bad
a light touch is best
repeat the process if needed
voilanote use only distilled water
normal tap water contains minerals that can ruin your screen with repeated use down the road
you can also purchase the microfiber rags and the spray bottle here on amazon
heck they even sell distilled water and white vinegar here
amazon ruleztip no
 dont buy the overpriced gold tip hdmi monster cables for your hd components
makes no difference
a digital signal is a digital signal
buy the standard ones for  bucks
geez these guys are unbelievablei have used monster screen cleaner with great confidence for a few years but this last batch has made a streaking mess on both of my led monitors
i think they changed the formula so buyer beware
i am searching for the best way to get rid of the mess monster cleaner has left
so far the only dent ive made is using a microfiber towel the kind you use on eye glasses and slowly clean inch by inch
nothing else is getting this off
i feel ripped off and i sure hope everyone takes heed and does not buy this product
please save your money save your tv and save yourself the agony of trying to rid this mess of a cleaneri fear i may have ruined my tvs they now have a rainbow reflection to them to boot
i cant tell you how
