this adapter easily connects my nook hd  to my hdtv through the hdmi cable
this is good for traveling because it makes any hotel tv a potential smart tv so long as there is an accessible hdmi port
it is also good for sharing photos from fb on a bigger screen
a bit pricey but a good accessory to have
be sure to note that this is only for the nook hd and hd series
it will not work with a standard nookthis item is just as was described in the original description works without any issues to be seen
good productworks well a little pricey i think for a charging cable but then again not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacementthis mount works really well once you get it up and going
only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot
but thats really not too big an issue considering all the different tvs and their mounting hole locationsthis wall mount does everything its supposed to do
the piece that attaches to the wall isnt overly long which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space i needed to mount it in
the only issues i saw was that the joints were very tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it the joints loosened up to the point where i had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up againi received the mount which was well packaged for shipping
the installation instructions were moderately clear
no issues following them they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing onmy shipment had a miscut piece and was missing  screws
i contacted the manufacturer and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day shipped out of texas so normal mailing times appliedi like how the mount fits together and i easily mounted my lbs tv by myself
the part that attaches to the tv has a hook that will hold the tv on the arm till you bolt it onits very adjustable and pushes almost flush with the wallim very happy but took one star for the miscut piecetook a bit of work but used this to fit an older vizio  monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor
stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles
the vizio was older and did not have the standard holes this product fit and holds the tv very stablegreat bracket for small tvs
i used it on a  lcd and it worked well
the large mounting plate may block some connections on some tvs
installed easily and could be adjusted to make level
the links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation
when the tv is in the desired position you can tighten them upi installed this for my sister who had a  philips lcd
nice sturdy mount with all of the nuts bolts screws included
only problem was that since my tv was so small and i was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection and the power cable connection
instead of returning then paying  from a local store i simply went to a hardware store got a    inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill and drilled holes into the mount
it was pretty easy but a bit messy
it is not visible after mounting the tv so who cares
it is one thing to consider before buying this there may be another mount that does not cover your tv connections
otherwise swivels well does not sag good valuei used it to mount a  lcd tv to the wall about lbs
i installed it in less than  hour and am very happy with the resultsproscomes with all of the hardware youll needcomes with some extra hardware of which i have no idea what it is there for
i suspect its a universal hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models but its nice to have a little extra which is always better than not enough
the included level is nice well its cheap but it worksthe instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unitconsmetal is just a tad on the flimsy side
i have no problems trusting it with my ltlb television but if i were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of lbs i think i would be quite a bit nervous about it holding upthe holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud
i think the particular stud i was installing it onto was a typical x and if centered the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud
i had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud
as a result i was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place but i dont feel it will be an issue with my lb television
if your house uses wider studs this probably wouldnt even be an issuethe metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it
i mounted the base just a little bit off level to help compensate for this and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to meconclusion  all in all its not a bad unit especially for the price
yes i would have liked to see a sturdier unit but when you take into account the lt price tag its an excellent bargain
i dont think ill have any issue with a static mounting of my tv in the corner of the bedroom but if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic constant repositioning etc then you might want to spend more money on something sturdierwe bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit
its definitely sturdy and works well
our tv in there is holds the tv fine and the articulation is great
we use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill
has cable mgmt as wellanother great buy from amazon
the local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made
this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with itjust to know that the tv will sit off center of where the base is placed
other than that it has held up and workedfor the price this wall mount is great
not too hard to install
the only reason i didnt give it a  star is wire management
i could not get the little loop to work
not a big deal at all however
overall i highly recommend this product
well worth the moneyid never bought one of these mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores
i hadnt looked online much and hadnt really needed a monitor mounting device until recentlythis thing is well built and it does the job
its not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor tv or pc on the wall this will do the job
it comes with a nice bag of heavyduty hardware
it is primarily designed for mounting tv sets but you can get it to work with a pc monitor as long as it has the vesa mountingit mainly articulates sidetoside and inandout
itll pivot a bit up and down but thats limitedonly gave this four stars because its only supporting a  tv
i think i would be scared to mount a  tv on it
if you sprang for a  or bigger tv spend a little more on a properly rated mount
as with any tv mount make sure youre hitting wall studs with the main screws dont just use anchors in drywall or youre asking for trouble
lots of hardware included in the kit so mounting any style or brand of tv shouldnt be a problemnothing fancy just decent quality and simple installation
as may have been mentioned one must discard the provided phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud
use your own
the tv i mounted with it is an older flatpanel so its a little heavier than the news ones
this thing isnt fazed and stays where i put itvery sturdy
the arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose
however the mount works great just make sure you get that stud just right
i was impressed with the quality and happy with the pricedont have anything to really complain about
except there doesnt seem to be a way or im missing it to tilt the tv up or down ie
mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair
and i am quite savvy with toolsassemblyetc
and it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the tv to adjust the angle
no reason to not buy it thoughbought the mount for my  dell u monitor
it fits the dell quite well and i bought it for its reach from the wall its ability to manipulate and its weight capacity
and in all those respects im quite happyhowever there is a noticeable tiltsag to the monitor when i have the arm extended
im not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall as that was expected but the rotational sag that i sometimes geti wasnt willing to pay  for simply mounting a tv so i bought this item to give it a shot
i have no real complaints
it holds the tv up which is all i wanted
it does not have smooth pivot points so if youre planning on moving it around a lot dont use this one but if its going to stay in a static area this is your mountthis is a rather good tv mount
this tv mount works exactly as expected and described
i would buy againthis is a good product
it went up easily
i did it myself
i wish i might have gotten one with a little more adjustment
its very rigidused this with a panasonic  inch lcd
very durable and works as advertisedit was advertised as fitting  televisions but the size of the tv mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television
i will have to cut the metal plate to get to the pc connector if i choose to connect a computerhavent decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plateother than that its a great product and meets my need for a hanging televisionwhy pay the  at best buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here
the videosecu long arm tv wall mount low profile full motion works greati am impressed with the solid design of this tv wall mount
i think this weights more than the  tv it is supporting
it also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the tv isnt too difficult
the one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the tv
this does assure the tv stays put but if you plan to move the tv on the stand a lot this may be a negative
overall i am pleased with the stand  it seems like a good valuevery well made strong mount the only problem i have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed
pictures do not distinguish between stud mount and concrete
also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsfor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually  inches wide so this mount only requires  lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a  lb tv
the four outboard holes on the wall mount are  apart so dont try to use them in a wall stud measuring  widehelpful hint i have help install at least  other wall mounts because of family or friends so i cannot say that i am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to doafter comparing the instructions on this unit to others i have installed i still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail
some complain that the back plate was too big for the tv they used but its fits perfect on thelg lk inch p hz lcd hdtvi am using it onworks perfectly for the area of the room i am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the tvperhaps i misunderstood how to install the mount but i installed the mount to the wall easy enough attach tv the mount with some screws difficult for one personwith one arm i held the tv heavy
the other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the tv to the mount
it took quite an effort to hold the tv for that long
certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier i have another similar mount where the tv back plate and the mount are separate parts
so once the back plate is installed you slide the connecting parts together
much easierit took about  mins to install this tv wall mount with a  inch samsung tv
it does the job there are much more expensive arms but this does the trickused this for the bedroom
put it in the corner but was only able to hit the stud with a couple boltsamazon as always  stars in service and shippingthe mount was for a vizio emv inch
product comes adequate with a lot of screws an alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts
the bubble level with magnet on the side and cable are a nice additionhad to cut  inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the tv since it covered some of the inputs
other wise very practical for my bedroomstudy that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good jobfor the price  and free shipping its is a really good deal
would recommend thiseasy to install and the tv is still on the wall after three weeks
i consider this a good value for the moneyvery concerned over hanging a  tv on the wall
got this mount due to low price
very impressed
no doubt it will handle a  tv
allows full  degree rotation with  from wall to centerline at maximum extensionit needs improment
i wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wallit looks shaky for  inch tv
however it still holds itmount went up easily and seems sturdy enough
however adjusting the tv sometimes leaves the tv crooked
also it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools
even after using the tools we couldnt really adjust the tilt to the full amountwarning do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount
mom and dad bought a  inch seiki tv and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing
that is where i the eldest son came into the picturepun intendedi knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall
but what if it was a typical installation would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely
it seems unlikely most people would so what are the optionsoption  buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small  hole bracket as on this model
if you dont know what i am talking about look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv
this model has only a small wall bracket with holes for  screws or anchorsoption  use wall anchors
again there are only  holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors
proceed at your own riskoption  install a stud
youre on your own with thisthe mount is well made everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned a little homework will save you time and make installation easyi hope this review is usefuli have an older very heavy  samsung high def tv that weighs substantially more than my new 
i replaced my old basement crt tv with it installed the videosecu mount easily and it does the job
i was amazed the price from amazon was only  dollars and with prime i got free  day shipping
the original price was 
wow what a reductionused this for a panasonic  lcd tv
mount works fine instructions were minimal
i was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the tv and to attach the mount to the wall
i did have a problem hanging the tv per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the tv this was not very easy so i removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount mounted this on the tv and now reattached to the tv mount this was a lot easiergood strong mount and quality hardware
includes all the different size screws required to attach to tv if yours doesnt have them or if you lost them
there is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around
i mounted a shelf above the tv to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long hdmi cable through the walli took a star only because i received a different unit than the one pictured it has  thick arms rather than the  that is shown
honestly i think what i got is more attractive but i believe that amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization
my unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture it has a mounting plate with all of the vesa mounting holes in the correct configuration
my tv is  so it fit perfectly
i am sure my  would fit on it too but i have a different mounting configuration for that onei bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazonits been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv i would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv
it lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere i set in my living room
this unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else ive bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door stepfor the money you cant go wrong
yes it has a litlle play in the mechanism but you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that
it works great and frees up counter space
i would do it all again
why spend  times moreit is a good value but is not top notch quality
if you extend both arms in the same direction the tv  inch tilts
however if the arm goes right then left the play in the hinges offset each other and it works greatgot this to replace a peerless paramount wall mount when i got my new tv
let me start off by saying it works as advertised
but that wont get you  stars
the problem is installation
maybe its my own fault for thinking all tv wall mounts worked like the peerless i had
see that one has a separate tv plate that you screw to the tv first
then you have the second piece the actual wall mount that you screw to the wall
once thats done using the bracket mounted on the tv you hang the tv on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt
one person can easily put a tv on the wallnot so much with this one
yes i will admit that once its mounted its a more secure connection but its the mounting thats the problem
you cant do it alone
depending on the weight of the tv you will need at least one helper
this mount is one piece which means that you have to hold the tv to the wallmounted plate while attaching it with screws
that can get tricky especially with heavier tvs i used it for a while with my old lcd tv which weighs  pounds
they do get kudos for providing all the screws for all vesa types as well as a regular and an allen wrenchthree stars for ease of installation five stars for usability for a combined four stars
make sure you get help when installingit is up know and should work fine but it was hard to get it to fit my tv due to the bulge on the bottom but i made it work and it is on the wallit works for the tv i bought but i had to use some of my own washers for the screws
i thought it would have everythingcould offer a little more in flexibility of installation but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedlyi have a  lcd monitor mounted on unitseems sturdy enough would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools
as it is i keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustablefor the price i certanily cant complain and would recommend this unitfits many different size tvs  is very solid and was easy to install
i would recommend to anyone is even slightly handyvery simple set up and ease of installation
i followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hexscrew of one of the center connections thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the tvso that i could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the tv as separate processes
both simple and quite easy
then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and reinstalling the hexscrew
i was able to install a  rca tv without any help in less than  minutesmanufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware as well as a hex wrench a small open wrench and a leveli thought this was a great value for a wall mount
i have installed a  inch tv in my bathroom with this unit
it worked well with the visio tv that i bought
it looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket
is it the best quality ever no
it is decent quality and it worked well for meim using this to mount an older syncmaster t above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price
installation was simple though i used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment as none of those included would work with my monitor
the tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle
i would have preferred another  degrees of vertical tilting capability but what is available will be fine for most applications
i posted a couple of photos that shows it mountedoverall im very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should i need to mount another small displayi went to a few places just to try testing them out best place to test them out first hand was bn
the people at walmart didnt want you near them and didnt know anything about them
best buy was pretty much the same except you could sorta test them out
bn though had people trained to know everything about them even the stuff that was not listed about them on the bn websitefirst thing not listed if the nook colour can do it so can the nook tablet
for instance read cbz files without installing any extra appsthe gb model was much more responsive than the gb so to me it was well worth the extra  bucksadd to that that currently if you buy one at bn and dont like it you have  weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition so no attempting to root the device which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the colourthat pretty much sold me i found a place with micro sd cards on sale bought a few and took my nook homeprosthe screen is awesome
i use it for reading cbz comics and pdf files more than anything
the missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better
also the response on the touch screen was greatmuch better response time at turning pages launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative cbz support main reason i bought itsupports almost every popular ebook format except for mobi which can be converted to epub or pdf anywaygood size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight under a poundbattery life  hours with wifi off  with it on i tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on mea test drive opportunity if you buy it at bn and dont scratch it up or anything
i like the idea that i was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that i want it to do wihtout a fear that im stuck with it for goodalso if you buy it from bn you can buy an oops return warranty which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it it can be replacedaffordable if you go without things like eating out x a week for awhileconslack of android market lack of some apps i would like to see on the bn market such as google music app no sideloading apps at the moment either
that being said this also means that apps available from bn will actually work with your nook there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either
this means that if youve bought an app from android market you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the nookthe screen
trust me i love it
but unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass on the nook if you crack it the screen is toastno front facing camera or any camera for that matter
the ability to use skype would have been nice but wasnt a complete necessity
ive had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once and thinking about it i wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that i will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on like starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth which to me didnt matter but it seems to be an issue for some people
there is bluetooth but its disabled and there isnt a way to enable itno gps this would be nice unlike bluetooth i would actually use itmono speaker instead of stereo again seems to be an issue for other people i plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when im on the road though and its just fine
i use headphones if im out and about
why on earth would i care about speakers that i never use anywayno flac support
a good chunk of my digital music now is flac
it does have ogg support thoughno avi support
again a massive portion of my movies etc are all in avi format
it does have mkv and mp support though so from here on out i will just have to rip my video files in those formats if i plan on watching them on itlack of decent accessories selection
lets face it the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of steve and the availability of accessories shows itfor the price this is a great tablet
it lacks a camera gps and bluetooth but that still leaves a lot between web browsing and running lots of android apps
barnes and noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but i did get around that by rooting minethat said i was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by amazon today
the newer version is faster has a higher resolution screen is lighter despite same screen size and has bluetooth
still no camera or gps
bn also is now allowing access to the google play store
it is available on the newer version but i dont know if they updated the software for this one to allow access
i suspect they didnt but this would be something to check on if considering purchasingif you want a tablet for web browsing checking email ebooks video and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend then it isnt a bad deal
i would recommend paying more for the newer versionthe nook hd
they also make a version with a larger screen the hdalso note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted android system off of an sd card
this will give more options but i found the original nook tablet to be sluggish running off such a cardpossibly because i also went to jelly bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet
i wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet but rooting is more work than inserting a card
the hd works well off a rooted jelly bean cardi tried kindle hd samsung tab  and nexus  i returned them all since i had high standard for display quality of tablets
i was very disappointed by their color faithfulness andor resolutionone day i saw a hot discussion online about discounted nook hd from staples
i rushed to a local store and played nook hd
its screen immediately attracted me bright white colorful high resolution
this is what i wanti have being enjoying nook hd ever since
it has the best screen  periodonline community like xda forum has ways to root nook hd and install android by yourself
i rooted mine and can enjoy all apps from google play storeeven today i still wow when i read text view photo and watch videos on nook hdthe nook hd is my third nook device
i like the nook simple touch nook tablet because i primarily use it to read books watch an occasional video youtube listen to music on pandora and work a crossword puzzle or play a game
because i enjoyed my nook so much i decided to purchase the nook hd because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size
now that i have purchased the nook hd i have some pros and cons about the product
nothing serious i will give myself a little more time to get used to it
but i am concerned about the short battery lifepros light weight and smaller than the previous tablet great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbudscons i have to get used to the new interface the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate when playing games and connecting to the web using wifi i have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quicklyi may have to carry my charger with me not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tabletoverall i am pleased with my nook hd tablet
once i have resolved some of the cons with this product i will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basishad some initial problems sound output was so low that i could not hear it
tech support said to deregister it and reboot
that cured that problem
then wifi would disconnect without any apparent cause
called tech support  times they were helpful and courteous but we could not solve that problem
finally tech support asked me if i had inserted a minisd card i had
they told me to check to see if that it was corrupted it was
reformatting that card solved wifi problem although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me
if you have problems with your nook and you are not able to solve them and you have inserted a minisd card try reformatting iti have an apple ipad i bought the nook to help me learn and understand android
i find android substantially less user friendly and the apps cost more and do not work as well
more importantly at least to me is the fact that there are at least a  dozen  apps that i use all the time that have no equivalent in android
in short i will not be buying an android phone to replace my iphone anytime soonmy nook tablet has really made reading fun again
i was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and after seeing my friends kindle fire decided to pick up a tablet for myself
the barnes and noble app market is a bit weak but i bought my nook to read so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me
the backlight is great for reading in the dark and i havent had any issues with glares while reading in the sun
the stock web browser is fine for basic browsing but if youre looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the google nexus  tablet
the nook tablet however as it stands is an excellent ereadertablet for the nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up
i checked lots of ratings before i ordered it and they were all goodthis was my first tablet so i did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features i was looking for
i did return it
i must say though that the camera on the nook was much better than camera on my new onei bought my wife a nook for christmas two years ago and she has used the heck outof it so i have always wanted one for myself
when i saw the price break on this onei had to act
it meets all my expectationsi have mixed feelings about the tablet
i really like and dont like features of this tablet
im keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the nooklike  layout and function of touch screen is intuitive  the kindle fire requires instruction
builtin wifi
the hardware is solid
the price is competitive
netflix and hulu are available and app market is expandingdont like  no bluetooth or gps
do not have access to the full android market
no video rental option  apple and amazon tablet have better market places
only  gb memory and although it can be expanded with microsd less convenient than other tablets
the ereader is not as good as a kindle but then what is
at least the ipad allows for the kindle appfor now im sticking with my kindle fire over this nook but im keeping my options open for future purchasesif anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook
one of the most important feature i found on the new nook was better page turn response
the screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest kindle
the nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called shelvesi liked  x  display screen
it comes with  shades of gray and is easy to your eyes
i can read all day without hurting my eyes
my personal opinion i would love this device more if i could read it at night without lightsproslibrary with thousands of books magazine that comes free builtin free wireless data network plus wifi connectivity no pc needed separate capacitive color touchscreen pad for navigation and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations gb of internal memory capable of storing  electronic books as well as a microsd expansion slot for additional memory font style and size are adjustable displays image files and plays mp music files compatible with windows and mac machines battery is removable and userreplaceable allows free browsing of fulltext books while within barnes  noble stores you can lend certain ebooks for up to  days free of charge epub format compatibility lets you read free google books and loaner ebooks from your local library page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgradethe bad no protective carrying case included color lcd  for color nook  has an impact on battery life for black  white battery is really goodinstore reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats no support for word or text files no ability to download books when outside the us even when on wifidoes it beat kindleaccording to design my answer is no
the thirdgeneration amazon kindle is lighter thinner and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand
it also offers double the battery life more internal memory gb versus gb
but the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle
nook should definitely remain under consideration when youre shopping for eink ebook readers
the decision may come down to a personal preference such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the kindleif my review did not answer any questions leave a comment below and i will try my best to answer your questioni bought the nook last week its always a joyous experience to buy something from a store activation was easy on the device took some time to create new account on barnes and noble site but i was ready to go in  minutesi purchased one book and started reading immediately after  days suddenly the eink screen went darker
the device comes with one year warranty i took it to the store and they replaced it in  minutes again the store experience was greatpros the device look and feel is good design is sleek and smooth touch screen is a good idea i have tendinitis so i prefer to use touch screen over keyboard the page turn keys are in good place very comfortable to read and hold at the same time found many books on the library search it has detailed editorial and user reviews with ratings just like amazon site the format is not proprietary this was a huge sale point for me there are other devices that can read the same format battery is replaceable and memory sd slot is availablecons the touch screen is sluggish you need to use it slower than using other touch devices this is either buggy hardware or cpu is too slow first device i got was defective not a good sign hopefully the second one is better browsing the web is ok but using the small touch screen to navigate through html is not an easy task especially since it is sluggish not all books are available in the online library i found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download you need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert sd card little bit heavy certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover bookwhen i purchased this item it was still running 
at the current price i think its a good deal but im not sure it would be my choice if i could roll back time
i originally purchased this because i wanted to rent ebooks from the library and that wasnt an option with the kindle
now they come for the kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats
you can basically use any ereader to rent these nowi read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper easiest to read
its not anything like a paper book its far less bright when it comes to reading
dont get me wrong i love ebooks
i havent read a paper book in a year
it is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me
you absolutely can read it without a light during the day but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book
i have a clip on light and with that its perfect at night
im able to read in bed and not disturb my husband if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can getim just not sure this is what one would expectthis reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet
it was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and i didnt bring the laptop and i needed to know when a business opened
its certainly not easy to surf this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinchthe battery does not last as long as i expected
i get maybe a week and a half out of it if i turn it completely off when not using itand if i have it on airplane mode not wifi enabled
i do read at least a few hours a day
the time is much shorter if i let it just hibernatei am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book
it appears to me it is the device that offers limited options though it varies based on the originating text of the book
the text size on extra largethe largest option is often it varies by book small enough that it would equal that of a normal book
my vision is pretty good and occasionally im annoyed by how small extra large is
in some books medium is the same as extra large in others
i do think that for anyone with vision challenges limited text size might be an issueobtaining books is easy to do through barnes and noble
you need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card
you can then order them on the computer or through your device
i generally use the computer but if you know what you wantordering directly from the nook is quick and easy
transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop using adobe digital solutions free app the library should have a link to download itall in all its a good ereader
ive never had any mechanical issues with it
it is sturdy and reliablei have seen the kindle and wish i would have gotten it
the kindle was out of stock and i got the nook
the battery life is not good at all i can only get  pages at a time if im lucky and on airplane mode
the kindle apparently will get you  times that
if i had to do it again the kindle would be the way to go but amazon lost a sale and was out of stocki bought this on the th of december after hassling with fedex to the point where i made them just hold it at a fedex office  days later i finally have it after it was attempted for delivery on friday  i was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is
ive watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and i guess the camera angles made it look wider
its so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket like pajama pockets
i already have  books and i actually finished one just now i started reading it at pm and its pm i say not bad the book was  pages too
once i got the hang of it i was very pleased with my purchase and i recommend probably just getting the nook simple touch but coming down to reading it doesnt matter just read people
thats a little rant
so ill maybe give another in depth review of this in a week
see you soon thanks for reading my reviewi bought this device not expecting much out of it
reading books is a breezethe screen is clear even in bright light
the device is very lightfeels like holding a small clipboard
i find myself touching the reading part of the screenjust a bad habit as i am used to using my iphone
as with any device you might want to breeze thru the manual first because i sure didnttook me a while to figure out that the n on the front is the home keythe craftsmanship feels pretty low end
i think if for some reason it fell out my hand it would definitely break
i have never dropped itthats just my opinion
battery life is goodtho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster
though this can browse the net dont even think about having a good experience doing thatthe browser sucks
keep in mind this is not a computer nor a pocket pctablet pcso if youre looking for something to browse the net you should buy something elseon a whole i find the device to be a little slow but great for what it is intended for
it probably turns the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book
im already used to fast devices so that is probably why this seems slow to me
international buyersthis device will download books if youre outside the us however you need to have a credit card that was issued from the us to purchase the books
i even tried purchasing an egift card from barnes and nobles and using that to purchase my books and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card
i ended up having to change the name on the account to my moms name and used her credit card to purchase books
she lives in the usamazon is missing big by not supporting library ebooks on its kindle 
i wouldve bought kindle since i prefer a physical keyboard better battery life and lighter weight of the kindle plus a marginally better processing speed and eink technology but since my two library systems i belong to contain thousands upon thousands of digital books that i can borrow for  days at a time buying the nook was a nobrainier i am cheapskate so i very rarely buy a book  instead i borrow them from the library
occasionally though i need to buy a book that is not available in the library at all or in a digital format or i need it for more than  days as when i travel overseas so i end up just buying two digital books from barnes and noble for my nook
had amazon not been so afraid of loosing sales by supporting library digital books a groundless fear imo i wouldve bought those two books from amazon for my kindle instead of from their underdog competitor barnes and noble very good product overall
manipulation is somewhat clumbersome but after use for a few hours it is ok  i understand that the new version color fixes these issues
the display really does give the feel of paper
only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditionsoverall love the productfirst off i want to start out by saying that i love my nook
my friend is an employee of bn so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions i had
so yes i did have a little bias to the product to begin with
however for what i need this is perfect in almost every single way
in my review ill compare the nook to the kindle  version and its major differences just so people know what im talking about in terms of other products as we go down the listthe bad if you want to call it that the nook is a little heavier than the kindle
im not sure of the exact weight differences but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier
now that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it
i for one dont find it to be a deal buster the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable but it is heavier than the kindle
i do think however that the durability of the nook is a little better compared to the kindle
the nook has built in paddles to turn the pages while the kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if i dropped it on its side or if i touched it to hard
my suggestion for anyone interested in buying the nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read almost as if you were reading a real book
the covers at bn usually start around 
the nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it
some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark
for me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text
however whenever i read a book i find many distractions around me while i read
its not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you wont see your reflection
again not a deal buster in anyway i wouldnt think
the start up time is atrocious
i cant defend this one in anyway
amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the nook would have a chance to get to your homepage
ok so not quite that slow but you get the idea
i havent timed it yet but im going to take an educated guess that it takes around  minutes to start up
that is something that should have been addressed from bn to begin with
again i cant defend this one in anywayok so what you have all been waiting for the good
the extra storage feature is superb
the nook comes with a built in gb storage space
enough for most people gb will get most every book you want to read in your nook with no problem
however if you are a fanatic reader that has newspapers and magazines delivered to your nook everyday or every week this can begin to take up space if you dont free it up
but dont fret
the nook comes with an extra storage slot for your sd card that can hold up to whatever the highest sd card space is out there
the great thing about it is sd cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found  years ago so adding space is cheap
the nook has a featured called lendme
this is something that the kindle does not have and im sure for competition sake will have in the future
this a great great great feature to the nook
if you have any friends family or coworkers that have a nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read you can hook up wireless or through the computer and lend them a copy of it for up to  days
if youre a fast reader then you can knock out a  page book in easily  days
your county library might be on the list of nook rentals
in the county in which i reside in north carolina our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which i can rent books for  days from the library
this also is something the kindle does not have
before i go off on how great the feature for renting books is i should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent
im a big thomas sowell reader and he has approximately  books out on the market
however the county library that i rent from has only  book from his selection
so do youre research before you buy a book your county library might have it already
the feature as i have seen is relatively easy to use
you do have to hard wire your nook to your computer after you download some software but its really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this
in fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website
finally
you can take your nook to bn and read any book for up to an hour
recently i went to grab some coffee at bn and wanted to read a book on ireland
popped open my nook connected to the bn network already programmed into your nook for ease selected the book i wanted to read from the list i searched on and wambam i was reading a book
you can read lots of books on one nook from their online selection without having to lug  actual books that you wanted to compare before you boughtin closing on this review i would say first and foremost do your homework
go to bn or bestbuy and try out the kindle nook and even the sony reader
some will really like the touch screen of the nook compared to the touchpad of the kindle but its all in what you like
some will like the fact you can lend books and some wontim sure ive missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying so if you have any questions please contact me back here on amazon and ill try to get to you as quickly as possiblewith these new ereaders on the market the act of reading has come back to be a very instyle technologically advanced and hip thing to do in  books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient and this becomes only more encouraged through barnes and nobles nooknow to cut to the chase the nook can do most things that the amazon kindle can do as well and while the kindle holds some ground over the nook on an overall scale if youre looking for a better and more convenient ereader id say to go for the nookboth the kindle and nook have clear displays but overall i would say that the kindles display seems to have better resolution
the kindle also beats the nook on battery life as youll notice that the nooks battery life seems to last about a week whereas the kindle about a month this is due to the draining power of the nooks lightup touch screen menu
people may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the kindle over the nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or notsensitiveenough touch screen
the kindle is also thinner and lighter than the nook
both have mp features though which helps them
its always great to be able to read to your favorite musicnow while it may seem in this paragraph the kindle has the nook easily beaten one must look deeper into finding out why the nook is a better choice
the reason the nook beats the kindle is easy  in its navigation presentation and overall ease of usethe biggest problem with the kindle that i noticed is that the kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size style and book selection
the problem with this is one thing  this is not a computer its a portable book and barnes and noble knows this and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a browsing bookstore type of presentation
this is a very big difference between the two and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it
and this is only talking about the older nook i can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extrason top of this the kindle seems to have placed the turnpage buttons way too attached to the ends so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often whereas the nooks buttons are more of a soft bendable plastic type so you never hit them by accident
this on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews daily logs etc give the nook an overall more coffee house feel which the kindle doesnt even come close to
and even though the nook is bulkier and heavier it actually is made of a more durable softer rubberlike material and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious
not to mention just more attractive and stylish
this is easily the hipper of the two ereaders
therefore things like slightly longer load times heavier feel sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall differencebooks are an oldfashioned type of entertainment and while the kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware the nook walks the perfect line of bringing the oldfashioned hobby of reading to a hipper style for the st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either
the transition is so much smoother on the nook that youll forget youre even reading off of an electronic devicemy wife received a basic nook for christmas
being electronically challenged she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to buy me a book
as the nearest bn store is  miles away i elected to follow the bn site to my pc to the nook route
opening an account on the bn site purchasing a book and downloading it to my pc was easy and fast
prices are about half that of a printed version
passing it along to the nook was another matter
the nook came with virtually no usable instructions either printed or electronic to explain the procedure that i wanted to use
after going back to the bn site i discovered a little free program called nook for pc
after downloading that program i was able to copy the book from my pc to the nook
everything works fine now and my wife is addicted to the thing she takes it everywhere
she still will not however try to load new purchases on the nookwe now have three copies of every book we have purchased one on the bn site one on my computer and one on the nook
with one nook it is pretty hard to share after she finishes and although i can read the books on my pc that just is not comfortable or practical
i personally think  or so for my own nook might be a little too much so i am going to look into a cheaper alternative
walmart has one or two for under  one for under  that some people likethe nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader
the other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical
the nook might be a little expensive for what you get but the service at the bn store we visited twice was excellent
one evening after dinner we visited a bn store with nook in tow
after my wife found a book she wanted we took the book and the nook to the nook counter
the attendant was happy to purchase the book with her nook and download it for her
the book cost for  and change downloaded to the nook  and change
he even offered to return the book to the proper place on the shelf
not saying they will do this all the time but it was a nice experience and we saved a little moneyi have been working on my fiction writing skills and wanted an ebook reader so that i could read a variety of other novels to learn from them
the kindle is a great device but i really wanted a color screen
the ipad would have been a nice option but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large
the myriad android tablets on the market dont seem to get great reviews though i suspect that will start to change once android  is availablethe nook color was a nice alternative
priced a little higher than some of the noname asian tablets but far less than the ipad
it supports multitouch has a decent color display and the ability to insert micro sd cards into a slot near the loop on the bottombecause it supports both epub and pdf out of the box you can find a nice selection of books to download legally on the web and read on the device without additional investment
the barnes and noble site also offers a limited but growing selection of electronic books both free and foraprice
if you get tired of reading you can use the builtin wifi and browser to surf the web
you can also play a couple of the builtin games with the promise of more coming in a future update from barnes and noblemy only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive the microusb connector is a nonstandard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable
the connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while its chargingapart from that battery life has been really good
i rarely have to plug it in before i am finished reading for the daythe builtin web browser works well displaying pretty much any web site that an ipad or android phone can handlethe wifi seems to find and hold on to signals well and i dont recall it dropping a connection so farif you take the time to learn how to root the device you can add the android market to it and many apps like the kindle app work very nicely on it
this gives you the best of both worlds in a sense the ability to buy ebooks from amazon and barnes and noble while keeping your color displayas far as eye strain goes i work at computers  or more hours a day on the job and more when i get home
i find the nooks display easy to read for hours at a time and dont feel that my eyes are any more strained than when i read a printed paper book
but your mileage may vary
if eink works better for you the kindle is a great alternativei like the ability to highlight parts of the books im reading take notes inside the book as i read eg to highlight particularly good dialogue characterization description etc as a writer and to post updates to twitter and facebook about your progress through a bookall in all this was my favorite  christmas gift and has for me eliminated any desire to own an ipad or any other ebook readerthe nookcolor is awesome it plays music is expandable displays gorgeous color allows you to surf the internet not optimally but the ability is there and is mostly easy to navigate
from me it gets a solid  stars
the problem is that as an ereader its already overpriced and the amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts
its cheaper and ships free from barnes and noble
amazon is usually  at everything including price and i already own two kindles i would buy the kindle in color if it came that way but the price being charged for the nookcolor on amazon is absurdpros
excellent color screen
firmware update to android froyo  allows for minor expansion of capabilities
responsive touch screen during reading
good sturdy construction
exapandable memory with microsd card slot
weight is slightly heavy but not too bad at allcons
although it can play videos on the internet videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player
for example amazoncom instant video plays wmv files which is not a compatible format
converting these files to another format is next to impossible since amazoncom instant video doesnt support the nook color
amazoncom cinemanow through best buy and even itunes movies are all drm protected and wont run on the nook color due to lack of support trust me ive tried them all
not connected to android app storebarnes and noble currently as of  only has  apps in their nook apps storeoverall bthe color nook is a great ereader with inernet capabilities and limited android apps
although a android firmware update was released in may  the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of otherthaninternet video playback put the color nook down a coulpe of notches in my book
overall though this is an impressive ereader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery lifebefore i get started ill just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display
the overall product will still be the same but some things like the instruction manual might be differentreading its a nice clean picture  the backlit screen isnt too annoying but i have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later
if youre looking to buy this for reading at length youll need to be aware of this
you can change the brightness of the page but that doesnt change that ultimately youre still looking at a backlit screendownloading pretty fast download times although i only downloaded the free samples from the storefront
hilarious since i work at a booksamillion  the storefronts bn
 were so going to lose money on ebook sales
internet pretty decent
i pulled up facebook  the page is crisp clear  loads quickly
i also went onto failblog a site with quite a few side ads
it was a little on the slow side but thats to be expected on stuff like this
you can also pull up videos on youtube so thats a bonusbattery not bad but obviously wont last as long as the nook or some of the eink units out there
youll get about  hours if you leave the wifi on
not sure about the nonwifi battery life right now but since the company says its  hours id say its probably about  hoursextras you can change the font screen background color  a few other things
while thats nice i couldnt help but feel a little underwhelmed by it
theres also the option to be able to toggle back  forth between the publisher default  your aesthetics of choice
you can also change the background on the main page of the nookcolor which is a nice touch
since were not supposed to change that with our store unit i wasnt able to play with that anytouch screen its ok pretty easy to use but a few times i found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages
sometimes it would be too sensitive  id end up a few pages ahead of where i wanted to be
not a deal breaker though
it didnt happen enough to where id get overly irritated but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritateduser friendly its not very intuitive to use
people savvy with ereaders  gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything
the unit for my store didnt come with any written directions it was all on the unit
that means that if its like this on the sale unit then that wont be all that helpful for the people who arent able to navigate well on the unitoverall my opinion is that its ok but not exceptionally so
go for the ipad if you really want something like this
i know its more expensive but if youre willing to pay  then paying  might not be that much of a difference
its basically a nookipad hybrid but without the option for all of the extras  apps
of course if all you want is an ereader  wouldnt use the ipads extras then this is great
overall it isnt a bad unit but it just doesnt have anything to really make it stand out
if youre a big fan of the nook then go for this unit but id play with it in the store firstthe only two things that really make this stand out from the other ereaders on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the ereader market
while the color option is great for childrens books  magazines this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading  that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the marketi did enjoy playing with the unit in my store but i dont know that i would choose it over the regular nook
of course this is just my opinion but again before making a big purchase like this view a unit in the store firstfirst off do not expect nook color to do wonders
it is not meant to be tablet or an ipad replacement
it is foremost an ereader with some bells and whistlesif im given a choice i would not buy a nook
for the price i would rather get a kindle fire
i own  laptops  ipad  for my wife and  kindle fires for my kids
nook color is an afterthought and it is for me
i bought my used nook color on another site for  free shipping  weeks ago
and it was a steal
the nook i received was in working order and it looked newi had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly
the only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets i own
again i reminded myself that this is not a tablet so i had to be fair
the features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at bestfast forward to today
bn was smart to release an update 
if you already own a nook color you should get the update
the update improves the speed dramatically
the navigation still lacks finesse thoughhere are some of the goods i bought it cheap it has an expansion slot
i inserted a gb micro sd card and nook recognizes it right away the web works fine
it can now even watch some youtube
it also runs flash
nook  ipad  the new update allows netflix to run there are some apps that are extremely useful
i love the smithsonian channel and pulse the magazines look great
the update also improve the navigation the interactive books are great
my daughter absolutely loves itand now the bads i constantly look for free stuff
unfortunately bn doesnt offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile the apps itself is sad to say the least
the offering is a fraction of what you can find in ipad and amazon
and most of them are costly too while the update improve the speed of websurfing it still is slower than ipad and kindle fire the speaker is terrible
it is located on the back of the device
if you hold the nook on your hand you may cover the speaker
the best solution is to use a head phone the navigation overall needs to be improved
it is a basic android without much thought
at times i dont even know whether to doubletap or hold to get more optionshere is my final take
if you are short on cash and would like a good ereadertablet
go get a kindle
if you can find a nook for less than 
go for iti would not spend more than  on a nook be it a colortablet
there are much better options out thereupdate january  i have used my nook for a month now and all in all i like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books
it sure beats a  incher tablet
the update  is definitely a must if you want to use nook color to its full potential
however i found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dualboot and disable any sideload of apps
the version  allows the nook to load amazon app and the launcher ex
basically it allows other apps other than bn to be loaded
the automatic update  disable this option
so if you are dare enough to install other apps you can backdate the version to  if you want to load other appsupdate february nook continues to lose to kindle fire in terms of contents
bn could not match to the behemoth of amazon and i dont think it will ever be
however if you are stuck with nook there are a few apps that you must have they are all free
it helps the nook color to be a good companion in a boring world netflix is a must
 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones
you are good to go smithsonian is interesting
want to learn something that you forgot
this app works great but contents updates are slow dolphin internet explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing
very fast and very convenient dont know what interest you try stumbleupon
it randomly pulls internet content based on your interest
works great on youtube vidoes good with words try nook crossword who doesnt use dropbox
it is a must springpad is great to jot down quick notes pandora works great too but you need a pair of headphones though who needs newspaper when you have pulsei purchased this for my wife a week ago as an anniversary gift
i already have a nook st and an ipad
it was a very simple setup
the colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent
it is not as fast as my ipad but its no slouch either
the screen is very responsive to the touch
the nook color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email websurfing and video
it even does flash which my ipad doesnt
i probably wont root it because for my wifes purposes it pretty much does everything she needs but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged android tablet
i really like this device
it is a little on the heavy side for an ereader but it is a great value for 
i would definitely recommend it to othersedit  update   big update rolled out on december th with lots of big changes most of which really improved the devicefirst the n key which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen now functions as the menu key instead like on the new nook tablet
prior there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function and barnes and noble has moved that function to strictly hardware
im torn about whether i like this update because honestly i dont like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu especially with the issues ive had with nook parts ive owned two cords in the past year alone
it does makes multitaking easier when switching from one application to another say reading to internet because you dont have to go to the home menu function first
for those of us nook color originals it takes adjusting from old habits but so far its not a bad changethe reader application functions in a much more friendly manner
the page numbers are on the bottom of the pages instead of the top in a much less chintzy font and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter
not really a necessary change but kind of nice
there are some fonts added along with finally adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia night or offwhite
the books also read sideways now in a twopage fashion though ill admit i dont use that much and wont even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books
just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly onethe magazine reader had a few changes that are nice
there are animations for the page turns now though why they dont have that option with the books is a big of an incongruency though the animations disappear when you zoom in
the menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form but are in a much more appealing accessible manner
rather macesque really
nothing huge but it makes it all more friendlylooking
randomly the magazine reading app is the only one where the n button is still a home button and not a menu one
wondering if theyll notice that and change it in the futurethe pdf reader had some awesome changes
before reading pdf files was incredibly clunky and did not resolve well on the screen at all
reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down instead of sideways like the ereader application and when you closed the pdf file reopening would take you right back to page one and never saved your last place
ridiculously cumbersome and not userfriendly at all
the new update not only saves your place but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways
it also scrolls sideways instead of down which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experienceinterestingly enough they still havent resolved the issue of pdf files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu even when the information is attached which is something i was hoping theyd resolve
its not a huge issue but its just a visual annoyance when all the epub files have cool graphics show up on the home screen and pdf files just have grey with the title of the book
lameoverall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before and i really appreciate that
the menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth and that just makes for a much better interactionthe ebook store also changed around and bn completely reordered all the categories and changed the look
i cant say i appreciate all the changes they made because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price and instead have to search manually in the menu
im frugal ill admit
i miss the ability to find free apps easily because lets face it it just makes me happyoverall i love the update they rolled out though
its nice to know that bn is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated
    edit  barnes and noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in finally
i have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since
    edit  a new update now allows for android apps and email on the nook which is exciting
im not all that into the apps they have especially the games but its a nice touch
it has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen and the issue that the nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books
i can now also put other apps on the home screen such as the email or pandora app which gives the entire thing a much freer most customizable feel
though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one because the screen glitches when plugged in are back
oh well im just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen
vast improvement right there
    original review from i received my nook color as a gift for an early christmas and have been using it for a few weeks now enough time that i decided i can make an educated reviewprosconsit has a great screen with sharp resolution
book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear and the touchscreen is responsive
you can adjust the brightness though i rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes
that being said i found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it the touchscreen goes crazy and wont even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device
you cant flip to the next screen without several swipes and turning pages can be a haphazard activity
that weird glitch doesnt affect the device at all when it isnt connected to a power source but its such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while its chargingthe hardware on the nook color is nice with a muted metallic finish on the front and back which gives it a nice grip though i immediately bought a cover so the fact that its somewhat grippy doesnt matter much any longer
the weight is nice about the weight of a small hardcover book which i found rather pleasant when holding
i still dont get the random openhole thing in the lower lefthand corner though
its like youre supposed to use that to clip the device onto something but i hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience
its clearly not awfullooking but i guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me
oh wellthe battery life is surprisingly good
i dont have to wifi on when im at home and the device will go for several days on lowbrightness
i actually had it on one charge for about  days one time and was pretty impressed considering other devices with lcd features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat cocoa puffsits androidbased which is great
however bn doesnt allow any apps from the android market which is such a crime considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if bn would open up the gates on that one
the fact that its androidbased isnt really a selling point its more of a potential point to keep an eye on one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road
the tablet does come with certain apps like pandora and games like sudoku which will do in a pinch if youre boredit comes wifi enabled and it connects to networks easily and without issues
it does recognize bn wifi hotspots and remembers them which means that you dont have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the instore features which is really convenient
the browser is pretty decent doesnt have flash but performs very well
i actually used it for emails and checking my facebook when i was out of town and it was snappy and quick though the fact that it doesnt have pinchpull zooming features which the picture gallery does oddly enough is a bit of a turnoff because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccuratethe bn store they have on the device is convenient loads content easily and is very userfriendly to navigate
once you have your information in downloads are quick and easy and you can also set a password for downloads to prevent someone downloading books without approval
also if you have a gift card for bn you can use it to buy books but you have to go online to your account first and save the information on your account before itll charge it and itll always charge to that card first before your credit card which is a pretty cool featurethe reader itself is awesome and you can sideload your epub files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately
you cant however read pub files like you can on a regular nook which i found obnoxious since i have a lot of ebooks in that format that are from a bn affiliated website no less
you also cant put files that havent been downloaded directly from the bn store on the device over wifi onto your home screen so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device even ones downloaded directly from bn online you have to go into the bookshelf menu and go from there
which means that if you dont have wifi all the time as i do very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen which is such a childish thing for bn to do really
it takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well and bothered the heck out of me when i first discovered it
granted you could probably fix it by rooting the device but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that so hopefully bn will come out with an update to fix that annoyancethe nook does read pdf files but its a very awkward process since the screen ratio doesnt fit the allotted size making the text tiny and incomprehensible so trying to reads books in that format is a headache zooming in is awkward and clunky and takes to long to be worth the effort
also closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page which if youre attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings gets really old really fast
if you have book in pdf form i would suggest downloading something like calibre and converting them to epub to save yourself the troublemusic loads and plays easily though i honestly havent used that feature much since i have an ipod and if i want a playlist i go from there
pictures also load easily though you have to have it in the gallerygrid feature to see previews otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open
silly little issue but again something bn will hopefully fix in the futureanyway great product but really more potential than actual greatness at this point
i love the fact that i dont have to leave the house to read a book which is great since im at home with an infant all the time
is it worth the money
if you buy it directly from bn online its  which isnt an awful price for touchscreen reader its really only about  more than a regular nook or kindle so i would say that yes it is
its just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like its halffinished but im looking forward to see where it all goes from heream about to get a micro card with android c and use it as a reader and tablet
this lets me get rid of my netbooknook wifi and router which frees up space and lets me use it anywhere in the house
hope its a good move
cape guyi have been down and up with this reader for the past  months but since april it has been a joy
bn has gotten its act together
the problem i had with not being able to open books has been solved
bn not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them
there is no longer any problem with opening any bookswhen i first bought my reader the tech support people were not welltrained
they are now
i have  books on it and no problems with any of themnow the goodies  bn just introduced enhanced editions of some books
these have videos audio clips animated maps etcembedded in the text
its wonderful
im reading dday and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text
for instance you read about eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the normandy coast
you dont just read about bombing or fightingyou hear and see as well
its a whole new reading experience and available only on the nookcolor or the ipad with the nook app
pictures in magazines like national geographic are gorgeous
they look better than the print versions
there is a selection of apps for the nookcolor with more coming out all the timehowever if you want all the android apps then  you can get an na sd card on amazon that turns your nookcolor into a full android tablet with access to the market
you then  have the option of booting the reader up as a nookcolor or an android tablet
you can even get a kindle app so you can get and read books from kindle on your nookcolorsome people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you cant read it outdoors
not true
i read my nookcolor in my sunny back yard all the time and although im a  year old lady i can read for hours on it with no problemnow for the goodies besides the enhanced editions
you can get an app that allows you to work on office documents on your reader
downloading files pictures and music is a breezethe nook also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries
all you need is a library card
libraries all over the us are lending ebooks
so you dont have to buy all the books you want to read
thats a big saving
and it takes less than a minute to download a  book
you just connect your reader with a usb cord and adobe digital editions displays the books youve borrowed  you drag the ones you want to the my nookcolor shelf
as with kindle there is also a lend me feature so that your friends can borrow from youthe touch screen is very sensitive and im very clumsy so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily rapidly and without bringing up unwanted menus
but that was true of the iphone when i got my first onewhy dont i go all the way  and give this  stars
because the device doesnt have a sync to farthest point read feature so if you decide to look at an earlier pagethe only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar
i can never get it to stop at just the page i want
the same is true of clicking on endnotes
when youre through reading them you have to navigate backwards to the text
there is a back button displayed on the notes page but it disappears before you can read your note
bn has some work to do on thisin sum if you buy it at barnes and noble the nookcolor is only  half the price of the cheapest ipad or even android tablets
yet for  more you can get the card to turn it into a full android tablet
it is incredibly more versatile than the kindle
page turning is smoother than on the kindleor am i the only one who sees the afterimage of the page youre going from while youre turning pages on the kindle
on the nookcolor like the ipad you just touch and youre  on the next pageone other thing naturally a touch screen will get smudged
bn says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth
i found that didnt clean it enough
if the screen isnt clean it can get jumpy
so knowing that the iphone has a capacitative touch screen as does the nookcolor i tried using the products sold in the apple store to clean the screen
they work perfectlyas mentioned in my earlier review i also like the nookcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page youre reading
also i find the web browser is just fine
in fact when im  reading and see a name or word i need more info on i just touch it and when the popup appears i choose wikipedia or google and surf to my hearts content
then i just touch the book icon on the lower screen and im back to the page i was reading
its smooth and fasti belong to goodreads and when im through with a book i can just go to the goodreads app on my nookcolor and post my review immediately
small touch but nicethis is my first ereader so my target audience for this review are primarily those who are also considering this relatively new technologymy initial requirementsin anticipation of some heavy travel i decided that i needed something that would allow me to purchase and store enough books to last me  months
more importantly i wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages
finally if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it i wanted to be able to see those pictures on my ereaderwhat i like about the nookone of the first things to attract me to the nook was its simplicity
there are only  buttons to be seen a power button volume up volume down and the nook menu button
the buttons are inconspicuous and dont protrudei was able to download almost all of the books i was looking for from the bn shop
to be fair some of the stuff i read is relatively obscurei like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notesi like that it shows pictures from booksalthough it wasnt something i was looking for at the start of my ereader search i found that i liked the builtin games chess sudoku crossword puzzles etcfinally the touchscreen is pretty responsive not perfect and the menus are mostly intuitivea few things i dont like about the nookas mentioned earlier the touchscreen is good but not perfect
it can be really touchy and trying if youre trying to get a certain passage highlighted
even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser
i dont recommend the nook as a netbook or ipad replacement but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online newspictures from physical books sometimes show up on the nook version of the book
when they do like maps in fantasy novels they are usually much much smaller
unfortunately all the nook books ive seen dont allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or picturesoverallfor the most part the nook met my initial requirements
some things i didnt think id use much before chess etc i actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layoverif you want something that will just read books then im sure you can find something better
likewise despite all the extra feature that the nook has it is no threat to the ipadbut for those that are looking for something inbetween the nook is a handsome intuitive and reasonably priced alternativei should preface this by saying i also own a nook non color g and an ipad gi order a lot from amazon so when it came down to getting an ereader it was a tough choice to pick bn over amazonwhy did i do thisi still love the value of a retail store living down the street from a bn i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books
there have been plenty of books that by their cover yes i judge and short summary i wouldve bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store i have decided not to buysimilarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books you really cant experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad
all that being said i decided to support bn because their library is just as large as amazons and i throughly enjoy their storefrontsok onto the reviewreading on the nook color is easy the android interface is fast and reliable not to mention easy rootablereading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook
there is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but i had no problems reading for well over  hours on it
the font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipadsize wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavierit is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensionsin the end i did not buy this product to read on it i bought it to root and use android honeycomb on itthis makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinionthe nook has virtually the same specs as the samsung galaxy tab aside from the gat  buy directly from bn you cannot complain honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tableti got this a weekandahalf ago and put cyanogenmod on it and it runs smoothly
nothing is instantaneous but everything is quicki agree with the other positive reviews
the color nook is an excellent reading machine much better than either the kindle or the eink bw nook
using the color nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities
the battery life is around  hours so you will need to have your special recharging cord which comecolor s with the nook handy
there are small imperfections in the nook operating system that will get corrected as barnes and noble releases updates
the same was true with the kindle and bw nook when first released
the key to a good reading experience with the color nook is to turn the brightness down way down
that way eye fatigue is minimal similar to the eink bw readers with similar brightness
even with the brightness down the contrast is excellent and the letters clear
when browsing the web you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors
the web browser is excellent
it works for email especially google mail
the trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the nook as a reader and turn the internet off
only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping
that way when you put it down at night the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep
costing only  dec  at barnes and noble its affordable and useful especially if you travel
the minus  star is for the few little glitches in the  operating system based on android  for the  hour battery life and for the current lack of apps
for what it is supposed to do it does it well its better than an ipad smaller lighter and far less costly
upgrades and apps will follow making an excellent device even betterbought this for my wife to replace her aging sony reader
she really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months
then i decided to root it and turn it into a full android tablet
now its sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she cant live without
performance isnt bad on anything weve installed
rooting takes some tech skills but isnt too bad
i would highly recommend the tablet even if you dont root iti should preface this review by stating that im predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky but do appreciate good industrial and ui designthe nc is really a great color ereader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific android based tablet
bn literally buries the android os under a very thick custom ui and turns off many android features
this thick customized layer is what make the nc a great ereader but a not so great a tablet
so while it is locked down it does what its meant to do very wellone can get to nonbn ebooks in either the epub or adobe pdf format
either format works looks and reads very well easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an ebook reading app
the fact that bn chooses to bury the location of the downloaded nonbn content and prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder placing said free books on the book shelf or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy
to nontechies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget eg grandma itd be a showstopper
but then again would such a user even know how to get to free ebooksmovies again wellhidden in the file system look great but bn has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen and the stock player is finicky about format
for instance my ripped for ipod touch movies play fine
my ripped for droid incredible movies arent playable
this despite both are mv files with aac soundtracks
the latter are higher resolution and bit rate so thats the issue
again annoying but not a real problemthe web browser is just fine
pretty much a stock android browser so fast enough compatible enough messing around but if i were going to really do some research id use my computerwith android  coming in january and a bn approved android market itll be an amazingly capable tablet for the moneyand that is what one has to remember its an exceptional value given the hardware fast processorgpu combination great ips lcd screen with better colorresolution then an ipad mb ram expandable storage great build quality and has the best ereader app bar none

best of the lcd ereaders period
great value in an android tabletfirst off for those of you buying this product expecting the eink experience you are wrong
this isnt an eink screen if that is what you are looking for go with a the original nook b the kindle or c any of the other eink dedicated ereaders on the marketthis iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readersthe magazine readerstudents with text books that have graphicschildrens books with lots of picturescomic book readersif you notice these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics which is something eink cant yet dopricefor the price you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality though with some technical knowledge it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market though it may void your warranty so do it at your own risk
similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color but they come with full functionality
another device this has been compared to is the ipad which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model
on the price point you are definitely getting a decent deal though you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced costalso note you are not getting g access or any other cellular service to access the market unlike the original nook that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go
the likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get
instead of mobile data service users have the option of accessing the bn market and the full internet through wireless
with todays cell phone technology many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go when they are away from their home network
overall this isnt a big deal to me but i am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the bn market so this would be a draw back for you for sureweighthonestly this device does run a little on the heavy side however i do believe that it is slightly lighter than its predecessor
still for the ereader market it is heavy
for the tablet market it is a little more reasonable
the weight is a sacrifice but as long as you arent trying to read while laying on your back you should be okuser friendliness and extra featuresi find this device to be quite simple almost immediately
every function that i have looked for has been where i expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me
the page controls while you read work great and i love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nookthe full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard which is always annoyingthis device also integrates with your facebook twitter and google accounts
this is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social mediaanother feature that is nice to have on the reader is pandora it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the readerone thing i wish this device had was access to android market but i guess you cant have everythingoveralli like this tablet
i think it was a good buy and i would buy another one if this one broke
for the price you are getting an underpowered tablet but it still has access to the full internet which you can use multiple windows in
it is primarily a reader which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as eink but for the market it is being geared towards you cant really complain about thatit came early which is nice it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details
but it was nice came as described and worked finei bought this item for my wife for christmas
i didnt know what to expect since this wasnt what she actually wanted
but i knew what she needed as she is a book worm and has magazines n books strayed everywhere
she also has no intent on getting rid of them no time soon
needless to say it had to grow on her she wasnt too thrilled at first
now that thing is everywhere and i dont haveto live with magazines everywhere taking up space
afterward i bought an hd
weve been more than happy with our decisioni went into the tablet market for two reasons  i read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the eink reader and  i wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone  ereader  notebook
the prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen the phone was way too small
after reading several reviews and recommendations i settled on a used nook color for both price and performance
i have not been disappointed
i have rooted my device for a full blown android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics
im just someone who likes to tinkereveryone needs to understand this is an ereader first and a tablet second even when rooted
at  you cannot expect what you would get with a  device
but it does what it is intended to do quite well
at  inches the screen is comparable size to most ereaders and that was important to me for portability
i simply swapped the eink reader for the nook color and it still fit perfectly in my purse
the nook color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing
my rooted device has an overclocked processor so i have no problems with speed
its perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news weather etc
and then get right back to reading my books
i havent had many problems running other android tablet applications and have found that the problems i have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselvesif you want a premium ereader this is a super nice product at a great price
if youre looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles camera gps microphone but that will handle the basics of email web browsing netflix hulu plus and other consumption tasks this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets with the exceptions of the kindle fire and its own successor the nook tablet
the bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what youre paying for and what youre not paying for
if you expect a  version of the standard bearer ie ipad then youll be very happy
if however youre expecting a  equivalent then look elsewherei was looking for a ereader for our  year olds birthday this past october
after researching the popular ereaders ie
the kindle fire i went with the nook color for one simple reason the ability to root it and turn it into an android tablet for a lot less
it also takes a macrosd card
while you can find the kindle rooted too i found the nook color rooted was more readily available and more affordable
since i was purchasing for a teen i  did not want to get a new or more expensive modelwe purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod   you can also purchase an macro sd card here or on ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a nook colorwe connected it to our home wifi and viola she can do everything ie
text free download games and unlimited apps from the market
the rooted nook color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phonevideo callsnote all rooted nook colors are not the same version
we purchased one for our son for this christmas and i did not notice it was not cyanogenmod   this is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the google play or android market as our daughters does
you can update the root software and i did that but i did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps
but honestly i was tired at that point and gave it to our son on christmas as it was good otherwise and i doubt he would notice
lolthis model is perfect for my teens but i am thinking about the kindle fire hd for myself because it has a good camera and i love photographyps
i also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot
i purchased both nook color ereaders used for  and  each on ebayonce i replace its crippled version of android os and replaced it with a cyanogenmod version of android i found the tablet to be very capable
the only negative is that it is a little on the heavy sidei purchased my nook color in june of  i had been online looking at various ereaders and comparing the features
i finally decided on the nook color
prosbeautiful screenvery responsive touch screenexcellent battery life you must leave the wifi off unless you are using itgood overall feel to the deviceseems solid and fits nice in your handspretty decent web browsing youtube etccustom sized text sizes you can go from small to very largeexpansion micro sd card slot supports up to gb for music documents etc note you cannnot store ebooks purchased from bncom on the card
consdiffcult to read in direct sunlight due to the technology used for the color displaybooks can be expensive but are generally slightly less than retail no physical book means you dont have tons of read books cosuming space around your homenearly have to pay for all apps angry birds etcwimpy single speaker that is hard to hear even with volume turned all the way up if no screen protector is put on this device you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore
invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the x caseen glareshatter
here is the link sometimes the nook color will freeze prompting you to restartalso you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have
considering what it does it is a great device its not a  ipad so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad you will be disappointed
this is a nice color ereader with basic web browsing email reading and sending capabilites so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising this is for you
the battery life is amazing but this is only true if you keep the wifi off
if your wifi is left on and your not using it battery life will be short
i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book takes about  seconds and when im doing email or web browsing
the web browsing feature is ok but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook
just keep this in mindall in all a good purchase very pleased with my nook colorupdate  ereader seems to be performing wellif you leave the wifi off you can get very long battery lifethis device was great for its time but since being released back in  better things have come outits fine for readingbut not much elsei initially purchase the nook color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around
when they upgraded and opened the android capabilities it became an android table pc with dedicated email app and improved web goodies
at last check they now have  apps and growing most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather calendar note taking flight checker etc
i can transfer word excel photos and music to it and learn more each time i mess with itthe one thing missing was a g capability of the black n white version
both g and bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on
my solution is virgin mobiles broadbandgo mifi wireless that supports up to  connections
you can use it for as little as  bucks for  days or  bucks for a month and more options
ive used the usb version as a backup when traveling for about  years so felt ok with the wifi version
works fine with the nook did have to use forget and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back secure wifi connectiondoesnt have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly table pcs but for everyday email and surfing ez to carry around with a nice cover enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and no monthly bills to use itthe new nook simple touch is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions
the nook makes it easy to chose a font style a font size single spacing or double spacingyou can customize the appearance of the text to your needsit is easy to read the nook indoors with any decent room lighting and easy to read outdoors in the shade
it is july in texasso i have not tried using it in direct sunlightthe nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time
turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframethe battery took a couple of full chargedischarge cycles to stabilize
at that point it was using about  of the battery for each hour or two of reading
reading an hour or two hours a day and using the wifi an hour or two per week would result in  weeks or  weeks per charge
in contrast my color ereader requires charging each daymagazines look much better on my color ereader but magazine text is very readable on the nook
the nooks is at its best with a book with plain text as illustrations art drawings etc
look crude compared with a color ereaderi have several books in paperback at home that i also have on the nook
because i can increase font size and use doublespacing on the nook it is much easier to read on the nook than in the paperback book
my aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the nook than after a couple hours straining to read the fine print that is typical of lower priced paperback booksif you want an ereader primarily for magazines you probably should buy the nook color or a small color tablet
if you will be reading books you will like the nook simple touch
look around and compare pricethe price of the nook varies widely between storesi purchased  of these in november of  we had a baby on the way and i anticipated lots of reading time
they were so inexpensive i got one for me  one for my wifei find the reading experience with the simple touch great
the pearl eink display has great contrast and pages turn pretty quickly
i keep the wifi off and battery life is really good
i dont think its quite as good as bn claims  months reading time
but i can go weeks without charging
ive only purchased a few books though the bn store i mostly sideload them using calibre which works greatmy wife doesnt read hers as much as i read mine and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive
holding down the n button on bottomfront while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life
it hasnt been a major issue thoughi purchased averso arc light for kindle nook  other ereaders  blackand it works well for reading in lowlight situations
the simple touch with glowlight wasnt an option when i bought mineoverall its a great versatile light small ereaderthe newest model is the nook simple touch with glowlight and not this model
it may be the newest without a light but its not the newestwife bought this for her elderly mother  but she couldnt quite get the hang of using it tech challenged my wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well all is good i previously owned a kindle and loved it but it kept breaking
i finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced  times in the first yeari bought the nook simple touch to replace it and am very satisfied with my purchaseto be honest the kindle is brighter and easier to read in lessthanperfect light
however the nook excels in nearly every other way nook is sturdily reliable
i have had no failures with it whatsoever although i carry it everywhere and use it daily
i do have it in a protective case but i had my kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway
point  nook nook simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent kindle ereader
nevertheless screensize is ample nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than kindle books download in a blink and are immediately available
this too seems faster than with my kindle there are some things i could do with my kindle that i cant do with my nook simple touch but i dont miss those things
i needed a simple ereader that just plain works and nook simple touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way without ads
point nookgenerally if you are shopping for an inexpensive simple ereader i strongly urge you to buy the nook and not the kindle
i have tried both and prefer the nookwe have the old nook reader which we love
we purchased this nook at target for the same price as barnes and noble and amazonthis nook is smaller which is nice
it has a built in light which is really nice
and it is touch screen which is awesomethe only flaw i see thus far is that you cant resize the letters
apparently the letters are a standard size i assume because of the size of the screen
anyway i would like to make them smaller so that i can read more before turning the page
however that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new nook tremendouslywhile it doesnt have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years
however since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires
even can play angry birds if you really wanted tothis is a sold update to the older nook but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it overnight in a wall plug only before first usage and that it must be turned on before trying to connect to windows
now knowing these two very important points i can enjoy my nook its a good ereader
how it compares to the kindle i dunno i seen raves and complaints for bothfor an ereader i love the nook battery life is awesome
would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators the display looks great even in direct sunlight more or less the simple touch looks cool very simplistic
no buttons all touchscreen for the most part the extra  warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nookcovers anytype of damage from what i understand not as many ccnacisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast no addswhat i dont like only comes with mb of internal memory
you have to pick up a microsd card cant delete files or books there is simply no option for it
im hoping for a patchwhich means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktopits very annoyingwhat id like to see new screensavers for download better support for pdf files ability to read word doc solar power geez why not it only makes senseif you only want to read this is fine
the newer models access the web have apps play games do email and color
this model is only print and only black and whitei love reading and in a lot of cases i found myself leaving a book at home because i didnt want to carry any heavy things
this is great
i put in a small mb card and now it holds  books
i gave it  stars only because the dictionary function isnt very good
i think it has a literal copy of a dictionary which means it doesnt explain the word fully but still doesnt allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation windowgood reader
uploads books fast
i do not do wifi on this because i have heard bad things about the updates
also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away
i have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me
but still is goodbought this to replace a sony have had for a couple years and am pleasantly surprisedarrived on time and works beautifullyonly reason i did not give it a  star rating is that for a basic ereader with wifi it should have had a basic browser instead of only connecting to the nook storeupdate   bn is offering a  gift card with every purchase from june  
they will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion
i bought mine  and my gift card arrives in  business days
now thats what i call a customerfocused company with excellent customer service
another and very important reason why nook beats kindlenook reviewi did my research on ereaders and thought long and hard about the two main contenders  nook and kindle
i chose the nook
why its design is futureproof as far as anything is because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future
kindle requires new hardware
i just read a new one will be out in august  and no no touch screen amazon kindle is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books like bn nook
amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and amazons customers yes the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on v software but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws
the page turns are now quicker and very acceptable especially compared with a real book page turn
whoever you are with they will have some problems and features you do or dont like
there are supposedly more books via bn but never the books you actually want to read  kindle has some missing for me as well as bn
bn will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and amazon make you pay for new kindles and risk you not being able to read your ebooks on the next version like v to vebook pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the value of ebooks versus paperbackhardcover
some ebooks are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly
its the same situation with both kindle and nook from what i can tell the touch screen is a nice feature futureproofed hardware but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally
it is comparable with the itouch touchscreen performance imho
navigation is maybe more hassle than the kindle as a result
this also makes the nook smaller no physical keyboard to worry about and easier to hold even though it is marginally heavier than the kindle the nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screensavers wrong wording as its just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode  no burnin with eink screens
you can add more storage in a nook with a micro sd card the kindle battery lasts longer but the nook is fine with the wifi turned off  about  hours
the nook battery is userreplaceable and costs just  unlike the kindle the nook extended warranty covers any accidental breakagespillage for the full  years a bn store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store in week  of  right now using independent free software available on the web calibre i can convert and sideload documents and news feeds to my nook
i have sideloaded web pages originally saved as html word documents and pdfs all in epub format
this is no doubt possible with kindle too but the nook is more than flexible for my needs
i read usa today and the bbc news feeds on my nook every day and they include bw photos and diagrams which are clearly readable
calibre has many more available using sigil again free software i can modify ebooks to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook
again no doubt a possibility with kindle but i am not sure  nook is just the one size no kindle dx equivalent
for my needs though the small nook is back pocket sized literally fitting in my back pocket and is small enough to read but carry around
i need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem  im not bothered about having a music player and the builtin speakers are not really capable as listening devices tinny and low volume but its there and will no doubt allow for texttospeech in a future software release which will be useful
the sound quality through headphones is goodive had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles
its comfortable to use its fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without ive read a couple free ebooks that otherwise i would never have done  and i have many more downloaded and ready in the wings
its actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover
the choice is yours but my choice was the nook and i think it was a good choiceupdate   pdfs on the nooki have found that pdf books especially with charts and diagrams ie technicaltext books are problematic to read on the nook
interestingly the bn store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a pdf on the nook  maybe just a way to avoid the issue
however the kindle will no doubt have the same issue unless you use the dx which is larger and so you can read pdfs nativelyif you read a native pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the  screen  impossible to read
if you use calibre to convert the pdf to epub format then the end result is variable
diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function even the text formatting may or may not be acceptableeither way i have given up trying to read such books on my nook
i would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where pdfs are the only format available
the problem is not nookkindle but the way pdfs are created
they dont have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other ereader formats and retain their pdf look
if you are going to save any documents for conversion to epub format dont use pdf
i have found saving as html renders a perfectly acceptable epub file when converted including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages for examplesee also my review of the javoedge snake skin case for barnes  nobles nook flip styledespite all of the negative reviews i decided to take a chance and buy the nook once i tested it out at my local bn
 i loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases
i read all of the pros and cons of owning a kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook
the nook won because of its versatility epub format book lending etcmy nook arrived on january th
since then ive experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that i can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys
the latter took some practice but i eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since
ive also read three books in the space of a week which is a personal record for me as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback longer if im reading an ebook on an lcd screenthe eink technology is fabulous
i can read all day and do without eyestrain
the letters are very crisp on a plain white background
even better you can adjust the font size from small to extra large
not only that but the nook comes with several fonts amasis helvetica neue and light classic
im happy with the amasis as it resembles times romanmy only complaint so far is that i am not able to categorize my books into categories
at the moment im forced to wade through my list until i find the book that i want to read
bn has already sent out an update which is a good improvement over the old interface
while the touch interface can be a bit buggy sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page
 i can turn pages in one second compared to the  seconds it would take with the original software
that wasnt a big deal until i received the upgradei also like what theyve done with the bookmarks feature
before they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks
with this upgrade it lists the page that you bookmarked which is much niceri love how i can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the bn site to do everything
once you finish the sample you have the option to buy
if you decide to buy the book you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there
you can also archive the books that youve read directly from your nook with the press of a button which helps manage your listsideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience
however you cant categorize your documents you can only sort them by title or authoranother great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries see  for a list of libraries near you sideload books that you have bought from fictionwise and other ebook stores and download free ebooks from either the bn site or google books
thats what ultimately sold me on the nook the versatility and freedom to choose where i want to buy or download free ebooks
the nook is not proprietary unlike the kindle and the soontobereleased ipadthe interface is very easy to use
it comes with a manual that you can read on the device or on the bn website
if youre still stuck on an issue i found this great forum  with friendly people who can help youive yet to check out the lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technologyother than my issue with organization i am really enjoying my nook
im looking forward to reading many books in the future thanks to this wonderful device
highly recommendedside note i agree with s dayton about the ipad
after reading a few ebooks on my itouch and my mac i have to agree with him about the eyestrain
for casual surfing and watching video lcd works fine
but for longterm reading eink is the way to gothere are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the nook and kindle so im not going to go into a fullblown comparison and review
im going to focus on my experience owning both most specifically battery life and availability of booksmy husband uses the kindle and i use the nook
the reason i went with the nook is because initially i was very anti nonpaper book
he wanted a kindle and i sneered at the idea
i was being a book snob and didnt like the idea of books in electronic format so i snubbed my nose at ithowever after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books and i had  big paper books i began to reconsider my position
upon return from our vacation i elected to get a nook
i did so because i liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard which i thought made the kindle look klunky
i thought overall that the nook was more aesthetically pleasing
so  i ordered the nookthere are two major things that the kindle has on the nook and that is far superior battery life and significantly more books available for download  especially so if you read nonfictionthe battery life on my nook is awful
so much so that i ordered a new battery thinking perhaps i had a dud
nope  its performance is just the same
if i am actively reading a book i have to recharge  every  days
if i dont read it for  days it will drain on its own
comparing this to my husbands kindle he can go an entire  week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle
it takes a couple months to drain with no usage
the kindles battery life is megamuch more than my nook
i have serious battery life envy
for that alone ive begun to covet his kindlethe second bummer is that most of the available books for nook are fiction
there are some of the more popular nonfiction type books available
usually whatever is most trendy at the time but for the most part any professional type texts or anything not on a best seller list that is nonfiction cant be found for the nook platform
however when i go to amazon  of  times ill find it available for download on the kindlebut
one thing about this is that for me i tend to mark up and highlight my nonfiction books a lot because im using them for reference sources
it is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real paper books
so ive actually come to realize that id likely be purchasing my nonfiction as real paper books anyways so that i can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags yes  im a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books
so im now fine with the fact that i cant readily download nonfiction to my nook and instead i continue to buy them as regular paper books
as i said above id likely buy my nonfiction as real books anyways since i use them as referencesi now download all my fiction books to the nook
so its become my source for pleasure reading which is great since that is the kind of stuff i take with me when i travel or about town anyways and can just stuff the nook in my pursehowever i very much envy the battery life of the kindle
if i could stuff a kindle battery into my nook id be a super happy girlif i had it to do over id likely buy a kindle for myself despite its less aesthetically pleasing appearance
the battery life and availability of books is far superior to the nooki already own a wifi  g kindle and had compared reviews between the nook and kindle extensively before buying the kindle
but because the nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free and my wife was hogging the kindle i decided to try a nook at a reduced price
while the kindle is clearly a superior product lighter faster easier to use and much longer battery life i found the nook okay at the price i paidit was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the setup seemed ponderous but once i got the hang of it ive borrowed a book a week from the library
the reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired
i havent found anything wrong with it and it looked new unscratched and unmarked so as a backup to a kindle id recommend it
im getting about  days of battery life in airplane mode wifi and g turned off and thats enough to finish a book without recharging
im not rating reliability because ive only had it for about a monthif i had known that the g is not good for anything except purchasing books yes i know it is my fault for not doing more research i would not have paid more for the g version as i dont need the ability to get books anytime anywhere
the web browser only works on wifi
anyway i really like the nook
i bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price
i have only had it for about a week so i cant speak for its reliability but i have loaded lots of free ebooks what i bought it for from various sources some audio books for my kids and some music
i like the web browser and the sudoku game
the only thing i would change if i could is to have an option to combine the my bn library with my documents because when you get books from anywhere else besides bn it goes to your documents
i would like to be able to pull up my mysteries shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the documents set or the bn set
i think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option only an option since some people probably like it the way it is
its a bit heavier than i thought it would be but not unmanageable
i havent used the library yet but have gotten epub books elsewhere the epub ability is the reason i chose nook over kindle even though there are a lot more free kindle books
overall yes i would recommend a nook but i would have gone for the cheaper wifi version had i known that the g was useless to mei got the nook the day before nook color was announced
i actually waited until the nook color was announced before opening the box  i wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if itd be worth trading mine inthere were some rumors that the nook color would feature a screen with mirasol technology and i was disappointed to learn that it actually had an lcd screen coated with something to reduce glare
i state at an lcd screen all day at work and dont want to do the same while reading
plus im not sure how well the lcd screen would fare in the sun and im interested to hear feedback from nook color ownersi think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines or textbooks or kids books none of which ill be doing
nook color also stores more books  and allows the reader to send updates to facebook and twitter directly from the ereader
personally i didnt find any of these extra features particularly appealing so im happily sticking with the original nookmy observationspros of the nookits bigger than i expected in a good way
its not heavy but has a nice significant feel to iti think few people realize how clear and booklike the eink screen actually is
i showed the nook to some friends and that was the first thing they noticedthe bottom lcd touchscreen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book coversgetting epub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy although you have to connect the nook to a computer in order to transfer the epub filesive been enjoying the nook facebook group where administrators post a free ebook every fridaythe instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the nookconsbncom has a free nookbooks section but for some reason not all the free ebooks are listed
i saw some kindle titles that were available for free and when i searched on bncom turns out they were free there as welli didnt care much about the lendme feature of the nook but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased ebooks can be lent out
publishers control which titles can be used for lending and each book can only be lent out onceeverthe pdf manual for the nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editingthere are definitely more kindle books than nookbooks available but i hope that will change in the near futureall in all i am pretty happy with the nook and i think the fact that it supports a wider range of ebook formats outweighs many of the cons
i like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out ebooks from the library is priceless to methe nook hd is a great  book reader
it is sometimes on sale for even less at barnes  noble storesit is not an apple ipad but it will let you check email surf the internet listen to music on pandora or watch movies on netflixbarnes  noble stores have free classes to teach you how to use your nook and most have an expert in the store every day to answer questionsan owners manual is provided in the nooks preloaded library
work through the manual page by page to learn all of its featuresadd a gb or gb memory card and carry your favorite movies on vacationvery good product for those with a nook book collection
works well with apps
all google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera
i brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them
the nook hd will read certain books allowed
my two units ended up being defective and kept crashing
was able to return both with no problemsi bought this refurb for under  and so glad i did
i tried the samsung galaxy tab  expensive and glitchy the lenvovo idea tab poor performance before i settled on the nook
after using tablets at both high and lowend price points i figured i had nothing to loseand was pleasantly surprised by the nooks capabilitieson the nook i can read bn or kindle books play scrabble from the android store and watch netflix
more advanced features such as gps and camera are unnecessary for me and i enjoy the simplicity of this device
it has a sturdy build and even though i did not want a white tablet fear of dirt it has not been an issue
i have had it for several months and dont feel anxious about using it without a coverits ease of use clean interface adequate battery life and features make this a winner for me in the under  category
add to that bns year warranty and i am more than satisfied with my purchasemy only qualm with the nook hd is that it has a proprietary charging cable not a micro usb like cell phones so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling
in addition it will not fit just any usb plug something to do with wattage i think
so if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work
same thing with using a usb port on a computer
imo this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device especially for someone that travels frequentlyi received the basic nook as a christmas gift
never really wanted a reader or tablet
im an oldfashioned book kinda gal
but when my daughter and i decided to make a trip to spain i returned the nook reader and decided to upgrade to the hd so that i could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email surf the web and read books and magazines
im just learning to use it but so far i think im really going to enjoy having this tablet
the only reason i didnt give it a  star rating is because it didnt come with a manual i did say i was an oldfashioned book kinda gal
would highly recommend the nook hd for your entry into the world of tablets and readerslook folks this is not a  ipad or samsung
if you want a wizbang then you dont want the nook hd
for me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one
i ordered my direct from b  n for 
it came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color
it is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but at the same time can pick what you want that they have
no need to repurchase what they already havewhat barnes and nobel doesnt really want you to know is that you can put amazons kindle app on the nook and read kindle books both free and purchased from amazon
i also noted that with the kindle app you can adjust the fonts and resize pdf documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading pdfslets not forget its a  in screen
battery holds well at  hoursi bought a gb sd card and so far have put  movies  and stiil room for many more on the card to watch in hd
i choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny sd micro card
buy dvd catalyst  really cool program for can try it for freeon line to compress those movies from dvd and then it automatically puts it on the micro cardi seen some gripes about them adding google store
not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps
if you dont like it then dont add any google apps
its still a free countryso for reading ebooks movies games apps and many others all for  for me it hit my tickle spot
i gave it four stars instead of  because it did not have a camera crappy speaker on the back instead of single or dual on the front
and the power cord is just too expensive for a crummy cablei had the original adapter that came with my nook color for  years without any problems
after  years it finally broke and i didnt even know people were having troubles with their chargers until i had to buy a new one
i have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again i dont seem to be having any problems with itthe original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though which is where everyone is having problems
so i will not deny that this seems to be an issue
for that it loses a star but because i personally havent had any major problems with them i will still give it  starsmuch cheaper than buying in a local store about one fourth the price
after actually using it i realize that having a longer one would make some tasks i need it for much easieri use it on microsoft lynch for telecoms
the speaker is a little tinny but the mic works well without echoingi hadnt heard of this  movie version of the classic mark twain story until recently but i absolutely had to see it
after all it had music by the sherman brothers best known for their work in mary poppins
and i love a good musicalthe book stays very true to the novel
tom sawyer johnny whitaker is a young boy growing up in s hannibal missouri
an orphan hes being raised by his aunt polly celeste holm
and he is quite the handful
he regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal huckleberry finn jeff east
he constantly lies to get out of trouble toothrough this movie we watch as tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery
he tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him
and he develops a crush on new girl becky thatcher a young jodie foster
but will injun joe kunu hank get his sworn revenge on the boythis movie is extremely faithful to the book hitting all the highlights of the classic
frankly that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going
once i got into the story i was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale
the scenery and costumes recreate the times well
and the acting was pretty goodunfortunately i found the songs disappointing
they werent bad but they werent good either
they arent especially memorable or singable and they dont really advance the story
i would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songsdespite that rather major flaw for a musical i must admit to enjoying it
it has a sweetness and innocence that i enjoyed
and the songs are easy to overlook since they arent a major part of the movie
so if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale you can do much worse than this onegood case while not new to kindle books i am new to kindles the fire hd is my first one
i wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me i often read in bed and with this it stands up some
i wish it were more adjustable
the reality is the way i use it you have two choices flat or slightly inclined
the way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright thats not practical for my purposes
i am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires this is very nice although i felt overpricednot the best leather but worked fine and keeps my kindle safe and protected
it should have come with a styluscase fits well on my kindle serves the purpose and for the price you cant beat itdefinitely a keeperi got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who loves yellow
the case is nice for price it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant
im glad it arrived fast and i had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days  to air out till smell went awaythe only downside to this was the cover covers up the on off button and the camera and i have to take it out of the cover to use the camera if i had known this i would have chosen a different onei bought this at the same time i bought the kindel fire hd  it is exactly as pictured the fit was great and the price was right
the reason for the  stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the kindel
you cant access either button while the case is on
apparently when kindel upgrades a tablet they dont change the name or add a number to it like apple does with the ipad
i went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version kindel and did not find anything
if you want a decent case and you dont want to pay a lot for it this is the one but just make sure its designed for the hd  kindel version you are buyinggreat case not sure how the hand stripe works and wish it had vertical stand but for the price its the best case i ever had
very soft and smooth on the inside
color is the besti bought  of these for my test equipment  they got the job done
though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque the other  adaptors were fine under the same torque
however on a different one of these adaptors i had to open up one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable
i would probably buy againthe ezgrabber works well but its software is a little lack luster
i have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the ezgrabber works well to do what i neededi bought it to create dvds from home vhs video
had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording
after that it work as described
delivery was fasti got this because it was pretty decently priced honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of  i wasnt expecting much
when i got i was rather surprised how well it worked
while its plug n play i decided to forgo the install cd and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturers website
while the video is decent quality it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a dvd the quality of the original played on a vcr is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a dvd
that being said its not all that bad really
but since i only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old vhsc camcorder it wasnt really worth iti found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually add a little more saturation and sharpness and use the dvd format for capture that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc i use windows dvd maker because im cheap bthe nice thing is it also includes an svideo option unfortunately my vcr only allows svideo with p signals ie dvd movies and restricts vcr video to i
the dvd capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what i can tell though it might just be my video card doing it  still its a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned dvds of videosaw come on moleskine  you make a terrific kindle cover to hold a notepad moleskine notepad even  and then no pen loop
what kind of silliness is this
love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop  clipping a pen to it is not the same and i dont want to dent up the coverwish it came in more colors like moleskine red and the other volant shades  and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors too but this doesnt mean im not happy with thisoverall good kindle case especially for moleskine users
i use it and am happy with itpros looks and feels like a moleskine looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the kindle looks nice on the inside and outside having a pad next to a kindle is very good includes two reporterstyle while slimmeddown moleskinescons no place to store a writing utensil wont fit standard moleskine reporter books even the soft cover ones too rigid backing too thick a lined journal would have been better feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose hard to get the elastic straps for the kindle to look rightas a longtime moleskine user i was very excited when i learned they made a kindle case
i have not been disapointed
its a sturdy case that looks great and performs well
its the first kindle case ive owned that seems to be a permanent living space for my kindle if you know what i meana few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left while the kindle is on the right
i can understand their reasoning but i actually prefer it the way it is  and im righthanded
if the kindle were on the left with the notepad on the right it would be more awkward to hold
for the few notes i take on paper its really no big deal to reach over the screen to do sothat said moleskine ought to offer both a left and right handed version if the case
i would think itd be easy to simply flip the design
then people could choose which version they wantedthis product appeared to be high quality and well made
it also has the feature that turns on the ipad when the cover is openedthe moleskin does have a very nice luxurious feelfor me it was just too heavy
not in pounds but when you hold an ipad up for a few hours a few ounces can make a big differencethere is another ipad cover sold on amazon that is a big seller at around  made of a synthetic material
it is much lighter and also turns on when openedi hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting but this moleskin cover was just too tiring for methe monitor has only brightness and power controls
there are five other unmarked buttons that do nothing observable
there is only one dvi plug
the included cable worked fine for mei am running the monitor on rhel   the monitor periodically once a week would forget how to transmit its edid on reset from standby
i ended up downloading the edid from the monitor and setting up my xorgconf to load from file rather than from the monitor
no more issuesim using the monitor in a dualhead sitting beside and hp  supplied by work
the height on the hp is adjustable to exactly match the yamakasieditnow that i have upgraded my graphics card to a gb ddr card with a dvid port on it the monitor gives me the full p for movies and general resolution of x
this was the problem
if you have a standard on boardintegrated graphics card then this monitor might not work for you you may not have a dvid port and it may not be able to support this hulk
on a different retail site this companys recommendation was to have a minimum gb on your graphics card and upgraded to a gb that is working quite wellim not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me
i have no complaints about the displaythe monitor does run hot though which i think is typical for this styleoriginal review below uneditedit came with no english manual and no dvds for driverswindows is running mine with the generic driver
the best resolution i can get is x which looks horrificim aware that the problem might be my graphics card but this card is definitely capable of handling at least p and i cannot get even that
i actually can set it to p but i immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberishcant get a setting for anything higher than p and definitely cannot actually use pim open to suggestions on how to fix this especially if the seller is reading this
ill bump this to  stars if they can help me resolve this i will send an inquiry if i cannot get it fixed soonvery fast dependable os way better than the wm good buttons nice scroll device good battery life bt and wifi works very well the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen other than that is nearly perfectthis pda came out in mid and it was a great pda for this period
mine is still functional in i have had numerous pdas from the palm m series to hps jornada and ipaq to a toshiba and an asus mypal a
this dell axim a unit is by far  hands down  the most impressive unit that i have usedthe unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the asus a also still functional after all these years
it does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures  soft resets are few and far betweeneven refurbished these are very reliable  an allinone gadget for all your needs i prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone
shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban livingi couldnt use this drive with acers aspire one erecovery utility but have determined it is acers software problem not a problem with the drive itself
but what i learned in trying to get help from cbear was that  they can barely write english  their first strategy is to send you all of the prewritten scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and  if you persist they will express doubt that there is a problem but will grudgingly agree to let you return the product
i didnt need to do that because the drive works with software other that acers erecovery but note that returns subtract  of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping
i determined that the drive i received is an unlabeled oem toshiba drive and thats a respectable brandi needed an external cdrwdvd drive for my toshiba nbthe acer aspire one usb external dvdcdrw cd burner suits my need perfectly
for my purposes a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly thats it
i dont need it to be especially fast or to look pretty
fortunately for me this external drive is quiet unobtrusive and reliableit has one eccentricity that ive found
it comes with two usb cables  one for data one for power  and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two usb cables from your laptop to this device
i do think its weird
ive never seen this beforeive had no technical problems of any kind with this device
i am thoroughly satisfiednot much to say here
good value
works as described
a little bigger than it needs to be but does the jobi bought this because my compaq dvd drive is not working too well
the external drive installed and seemed to do its stuff without any problems on win
it comes with an extra usb cable to provide extra power to the drive if your primary usb port is not sufficienton the acer i use for streaming to my tv it was just plug in and use no further installation was required also a win machinethis external usb dvdcd drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle cds and dvds
the drive itself is slim and light ready to travel with your netbook
it conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop usb port
assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box
the drive is not necessarily ruggedized so some care with handling is advisable
highly recommendedi bought this to replace another external drive that was only a dvr i needed a cdcdrwdvd
i opened my very carefully wrapped and packaged drive and was pleased to see that it stated cdcdrwdvd right on the front of it
i was unsure of the  cords as well but i plugged them both into my dell netbook and it worked right away
the only thing i dont like is that when you eject you have to kind of pull the tray out
it also seems just a tad sensitive if you touch it while its working
other than that a great deal and good producti needed to get this external usb dvdcd device for a laptop i have that doesnt have a cddvd drive in it
i was very pleased when this arrived and it didnt need any set up
all i had to do was hook it to the laptop and it worked very smoothly and easily
this is a solidly good product and for a good price and so far it is working very well
however i felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working so the user has to be a little careful with iti bought this external drive when the builtin drive on my computer died
buying an external drive was cheaper than hiring a computer repair person to come to my home and put in a new drive
the drive works ok nothing spectacular  it appears a little flimsy but so far no problems
i rarely use it but bought it for those times when i want to watch a dvd movie or install new software that is delivered on a cdno problems so far except unable to upload a program cd
not sure if it was the cddvd my computer or the software but just that one disc
that disc works in my desk top but not in this unit
not sure why
all other dvds and cds have been working without a problembasic dvd player for the computer
plug it in and it works
so far so goodi bought this external dvd for my mini dellit works great but it does not play all region dvdsit only plays regions kept trying to view some anime  regular cartoons but no can dootherwise its a ok  drivei havent had these long but they appear to work
only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times i can recharge them
price was good thoughthese batteries work flawlessly
the charger is why i dropped a star
sometimes it doesnt recognize the batteriesive had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries  times and a third battery once
so far everything works as expected
i use them in a fenix pd premium  luxeon rebel led    lumens and a fenix p ce cree  xre led   lumens
for me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was
i get maybe an hour to  hours total runtime depending which brightness levels im using
i dont use the lights for more than  or  minutes at a time anyway so thats plenty of uses between charges for mea nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included too
most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost
probably the only thing i would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together
i made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory cardbattery case i had hanging around
it just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happenupdate i just wanted to update this review to say i am still using these cells and they are still working great
i think the runtime has improved after a few chargerecharge cycles which is what is supposed to happen so these are lasting even longer in my lights now
i only recharge them maybe every  months with occasional use of my lights
still highly recommendedupdate i guess its time for my now yearly update on these batteries
they are still all going strong
i still only recharge them about every  months but thats because they have a very good charge retention and capacityanother big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer 
i keep my fenix p ce light on my keychain
to turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly
if you unscrew it all the way the head comes off that how you replace the battery
i guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as i was walking to my car i removed my car keys from my pocket
i stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was
well it turned out to be one of these batteries
i had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery
i didnt have anything to lose so i trimmed off the plastic that was torn and sealed the case up with some super glue
fortunately the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine  still had a full charge
ive since charged it twice and it is still working great
still highly recommendedyou must unplug the microphone unit to hear any replaysounds
ill hack it in the future in order to allow sounds while its plugged inthis an awesome product
it was cheap and works well
i use it to record lectures in college so i can listen to them againsensitivity is slightly on the low siderecords loud static noise every three secondsotherwise its a good productthis item works with an iphone  s and a samsung galaxy s
the microphone picks up sound  time better than the built in phone mic
the shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it
this lets you use your phone as a digital recorder
i will buy another onei plugged it in and it worked
it is small but taking it with you is a challenge
how about making it into a key chainits simple and works well for me
sellers say you have to purchase an additional app but mine works fine with the included memo app on my ipod touch g
down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recordingnice add on for those who have an ipod touch
not a miracle worker but provides microphone capabilityi like it but a little expensive compared to others i saw online after purchasing
other than that its goodjust got back from a week in london and paris
i used this adapter to power my hp laptop and i used its builtin usb port to charge my blackberry bold iphone gs and ipod touch with no problems at all
the builtin lights are really handy
the power light lets you know its plugged into a working ac wall plug
i found that not all plugs in the chicago and houston airports are working so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet
the second usb light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the usb device
for example when my blackberry was plugged in and recharging the light glowed somewhat dimmly but when i made a call the light glowed more brightly
so you can tell when you have a good connection to your usb deviceoverall its well built and easy to operate
ill be keeping this in my travel bagordered sept  from another company on amazon for  which included shipping
i sent it with a gift to someone in the ukitem is finished well the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly
came with instructions and carrying pouchonly trouble i had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computers power cord plug into the ac receptacle
very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it
much easier after thatthe usb slot and its light worked but the second light for the ac receptacle did not
however the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through itthe usb light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged
also another switch was shown in the instruction diagram i dont remember what it was supposed to be for that wasnt on the adapterrecipient uses the usb slot to charge a camera and mp player and reports it is working fine for those devices
thrilled to have the eu plug tooif it lasts great product and very cost effectivegreat product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads it does not charge them at all i would rate this a perfect  stars if it did its a pittyit looks just like the real thing however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one
not a big issue considering the pricegoogle is selling those for way too much they will not get my money for such overpriced itemthe micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever
the adapter that came with it did not work at all
luckily i had an extrathis card works well with my gopro
lots of storage space in a small package
the price was fair for a sandisk producti liked it
i is already formatted and no need for formatting it
my galaxy s recognized it easily and easy to use
the only reason i gave  star because it is not g as stated and it is only g
i dont know if that is supposed to be or not
i am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body 
you wont never regret this is oem from kingston
ive had other data storage items from them
all good
this one too
have not used the adapteri bought the  gig
card for just that purpose my samsung phone takes as good pictures as most cameras
in fact i like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s
i would buy it again and again if i needed a lot of memory
i recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera
i like to take moving photos with my samsung and those  second runs take a lot of memory now i dont have to worry and running out of memoryfit inthe phone and worked fine
it is tough to get enthusiastic about memory except as one ages and loses theirsand i like the lengthmakes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the tv
my tv is mounted high on the wall so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling
i havent yet used the cable but it appears to be strong and flexiblethe cable itself is very flimsy compared to the oem canon
seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for moneyglad this is available and at a decent price
so many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for iti have this slot in my canon d which states it is for a hdmi cable that can be hooked up to a hdtv
it is supposed to provide a sharper picture so i thought i would get one
canon wants  for the cable  no thanks
on amazon i found a cable for less than   can you believe that
it works great
sorry canon but i have found the price of all your accessories way out of lineit is not thin and light
you can put it in your camera bag so it is very portablethe pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tvi am hesitant to give it  stars because the first time i tried using it it did not worki had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually workthis cable works well with my ti this best thing is that it is ft
long so you dont have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and videothese cables are good
not top of the line
however they do get the job done and seem to work well with my dslrnice economic hdmi cable
i got it for my mom to use with her new tablet
so she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants
it works just great
nice and long cable
i was surprised how thin the cable was but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvsthis cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen so i could see videos betteri bought this for my d it good material seems ok bit cheap but it works
but i think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from monopricethe thing is that i discovered that having a converter from mini and regular hdmi and a cable works better for mei ordered this as sold by cable matters fulfilled by amazon because of the prime shipment and having received defective products from eforcity previously
for less than five bucks for a  hdmi as long as it works im happy
oddly if you go to the cable matters store they have one for a few cents more with a different photo
i received one that looks a bit different from that photo and the one on this listing
the one received has very squareedged plastic around the connectors rather than the  rounded sides shownit arrived in two days and fits my lumix dmczs
photos and video look great on my flat screen tv
so it does what i want but appears a bit different from the photothis mini hdmi cable  works great when connecting it to my digital camera
i could view my photos in hd with my large screen hdtvi got this to connect my canon d to the tv
i like the low price and the quality of picture i get on tv but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag
i wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handleyou can buy this foot cable for such a great price
the length is great
it allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort
i recommend this cablei didnt expect this camera to  be as good as it is
takes good pictures and videos
but i am glad that i didnt buy from kodac their price is pricey
i gave less than  and consider this money well spenti would recommend this cameradoes exactly as it is supposed to do it charges the gps
best to leave it plugged in over night as it takes a while to do the full chargeexcellent
this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new iphones and others thing to mei really dont have one of these wall chargers
i did buy the accessory kit for the garmin w and use the usb cable attached to my desk top to charge my nuvi  for what its worth
also i might mention that the sandisk gb sd card i bought for my w may not serve to increase memory for gps garmin nuvi functions
the sd card will hold photos and recall them to display on the nuvi but i dont know that it will service routine gps functions
if anyone has knows or gets information about this i would like to hear about iti conveyed this info so that people wont buy stuff that they really dont need and expect it to do what it wont doi bought two of these for use with two garmin nuvi   units
in my opinion it is unfortunate that the garmin nuvi  requires extra storage capacity to handle updates i think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the united states and canada
i dont know yet whether i am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and i dont know whether a bigger card is availablelets just get past all the bs okay
theyas in maxellshould still be selling these
i record on them all the time and its just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued or be sold for fifty dollars
its true that no tape really sounds better than these unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again which is impossible in this marketi record lps onto these tapes and listen to them in the car
it took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording as in where i should average the peak decibels to record at
i eventually came to five plus which means the bars never go above four decibels
i believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound that while the directional booklet for my cassette player a tck sony threehead says record at plus three letting it go a little bit above that but average at  means youre getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums
they also say to record two decibels below the distortion point and for me thats like  on a lot of stuffsome records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels
for instance prince sign o the times is very loud and i record at around five or below while the smiths queen is dead the newly remastered version is softer and i record at a  recording level
recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium while the decibel count meter shows you howscientifically that isloud what you are recording really isnow im not gonna say its always pretty sometimes theres an album like let it bleed where the lp was put together rather shoddily and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks
in such cases ive tried to record each track at the peak individually though i havent really heard them enough yet to know if this works
i will say that listening to these on a car stereo well the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than floorstanders and a good sony receiver
you have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape but the reward can be fantasticyou see i used to listen to cds like all through college but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids
plus you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp
basically i cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless i have extremely good speakers and thats not oftenso lps it is for me but i wanted to hear them in my car so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right
high bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias which if you listen through a good stereo reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper
the high bias is pretty accurate though someday i would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player i have and see if i cant do even better
oh well right now i have a system and it works pretty welland to think theyre not putting cassette players into new cars anymore
i rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue and most importantly vinyl which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work
its what they get for years of  for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody
they wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again and look where it has got them
people listen to musicif at allas a casual thing where they never really listen and wouldnt spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear
the labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lpbut at least i can find used lps for bargain prices now ehor prohibitively expensive boxsetsmaxell manufactures excellent xlii high bias  minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording
as long as you have the right kind of equipment these tapes record the sounds of record albums radio shows cdrs people talking and more
these tapes have  minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are  blank minutes for recording on each side
record lectures music conversations piano playing and morewhatever you want
the tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your carthe tapes are extremely well made in that they do allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times and they take up very little room so theyre easy to carry around with youif you pay the current amazon price of  for the fivepack you spend roughly  per tape
some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway not minding having to pay the priceunfortunately these tapes still cannot produce  the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you
this means that if hypothetically you were to copy a cdr onto another cdr instead of a maxell cassette tape the quality of the sound on the cdr copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these maxell cassette tapes will give you
moreover cassette tapes can break if not handled with care
they can also break if used a few too many times too
therefore i recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup
these shortcomings frustrate me and therefore i will have to take off one star to make this a four star reviewthe tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible
if you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole
the cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording
i also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recordingoverall maxell xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music the radio people talking or anything you wish to record
i have used this brand for decades and i cannot think of any major complaints
i highly recommend maxell normal bias  minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tapeim actually a bit shocked
ive been using this cassette adapter for the past two years
the sound quality is good although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes
the cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well
in cold weather it sometimes sticks a bit
but overall it has worked quite well
i dont leave my mp player in the car so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging
it managed to last  years which is excellent considering how quickly mm stereo cables can develop shortsuse this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player
works great and the audio is pretty good
better then radio quality but not cd qualityit works fine and is a pretty good product
i picked this one over  other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews
it does the job wellthis works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car
the cord is probably  feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality
mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapterthis works great and saved me  that a newer vehicle would have cost
plug it in and listen to whatever youve got on your phone or access stations through your phone
its fun to listen to foreign stations etcworks fine
the only caveat is that you may need to manually switch the end where the cable comes out to match the  direction of your cassette player
when used as configured my player rejected it until i changed the end the cable came out
i would have preferred a product that did not require configurationworks well purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time
sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette playeri did a lot of investigating before buying this product
i ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that i could find in stores
however i am not disappointed at all
the sound isnt quite cd quality but its pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape
i dont have an fm adapter but from what i read the cassette adapters have a much better soundthe other big bonus is that it doesnt matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed
warning some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction
every once in a while i have to put the tape in twice for it to work right otherwise i havent had any other problems with this and it gives my mp player a great sound
another tip if you dont have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp player what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble for me if i have the mp player sound lower and the car stereo louder ill have more trebleand a little more static tooas an aside i doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negativelyi was pretty skeptical that this item would produce acceptable output through my honda crvs cassette player when connected to a sansa fuze
however i was pleasantly surprised  not only that the sound was acceptable but it is actually quite good
as a professional midi musician im pretty demanding in what i consider good this maxell adapter far exceeds what i was expecting from this type of technologyi understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality
probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device specifically the playback heads
the results werent quite as impressive in one of my inhome cassette decks though still goodanother very important factor is the quality of the mps being played the better the playback device the more readily youll hear the shortcomings of a mp or other digital file
after all some people are happy with  kbps mps which are pretty low quality to begin with and none of my mps are less than  kbps  even those ive purchased from amazonoverall im very happy with this device and consider it a very good inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated line inline out option like those you find on newer incar decks
near cdquality to be surethis makes it easy to clean your cd player
it tells you what to do when you play it and is not liquid based
good cleaner and for dirtier lenses make sure you use a few times to get it good
always good to have one of these arounddid not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive
when i put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvdsi beleive it is ok just havent tried it in any other dvd drives i haveeasy to use and cleans a cd or dvd completely
try it and you will think it is good also
great price much better than buying locallyi was having problems burning dvds in my macbook pro superdrive
bought this and didnt realize it said not for use in laptops until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drivebutit worked
tried burning a dvd afterwards and it worked
i guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trickhow bout thatstarted having issues with my indash cd player after yrs
kept getting read errorscleaned the reader and not having any additional issues
nothing more than a little dustalso cleaned the  cd system thought it was having overheating issuessince it is still cold weather may still have the issue however no new problems after using the cleaning diskgood  headphones
i like very much that they only have a wire on one side  and they are lightweightthe sound is pretty good
i enjoy using themthese headphones are perfect for the walking ipodiphone listener
no buds in ear no strand ear canal
i use other headphones but these are good like the fold in ear pads
cord could be about  longer but still okayanother good buy
again very affordable and they work
far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore
i like the single wire it seems to be much easier to manage than two of themi have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and theyre pretty good
i bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap
considering that i buy a pair every month or so ill try some other brandsi bought this to clean the vcr player component on a combo machine when we noticed the picture from the vcr was pretty shaky
despite using the dry head cleaner that was on hand we noticed no improvement
apparently this wet cleaner was exactly what was needed
the picture shaking disappeared and did not returnconsider this a remedy for treating a dinosaur in the tech world
glad this was still availablethis is a good wet cleaner
works great and cleans the tape head so you no longer see static
simple to use and can be used many timesthese products are hard to find anymore
while it does appear that this product does clean the heads the one thing it does not appear to do is rewind the tape upon completion
do not know why it is becoming difficult to find tape head cleaning products such as this anymore considering that the dvdvhs players are still being soldmy hubby and i bought this wet cleaner due to the fact that we still have vcrs at home
needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage
we liked it but eventually we will have to join the st century and start getting dvrs  since it is impossible to but new old vcrs
it did the job but this product can not be used all the timei used this wet head cleaner and my vcr is working much betteri recommned this product to those who still use a vcrdid the job worked as instructions said and removed the dirt that it needed to
my player was worn out so it did not help that problem in the tape jumpingcleaned my old vcr heads pretty good
quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvdit works but its expensiveon a side note i was just playing with it yesterday and i happen to stick it on a hood of a canon   esii and to my surprise it fits it like a glove
it stays there and does fall off
you would think it was made for it
i just thought that was super coolworks just like it should
serves as a great way to get proper white balance
just place in front of lens depress shutter button to focus and light meter then remove and shoot
images look much better nowits one of the better shower radios for sure but it still sounds like a shower radioi looked at several brands of am fm tv weather radios for use during severe weather when power might be out
i was searching for specific features battery power for power outages tv band tornado tracking is sophisticated enough to get down to streetlevel tracking on tv
nws hasnt caught up yet decent sound qualitythis radio met all my needs with the added bonus of being waterresistant
i must admit i am baffled by the term as everything is waterresistant to one degree or another
reception is good in all areas of my home including those areas where we cower when tornados are lurking
the radio includes a wire antenna for fm reception which stows in the battery compartmentsony recommends leaving the three quotcquot cells in the radio and changing them every year
this maintains the time and radio presetspros  good reception solid design handy controls good soundcons  bigger than someto avoid finding the radio with dead batteries or worse corrosion in the battery compartment i set reminders in my palm to change various batteries annuallythis radio has been good  i have owned several sony showertype radios and this units quality is among the best
very good sound built very solidly controls are easy to use and understand
my only wish is that they had better mounting options  i have it hanging from a shower mirror now there has got to be a better way to mount a radio with a holstertype bracket or somethingi have tried several waterproof radios and these sonys are the only ones that work well
if the volume went a little louder i would have given it  starsthe sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good
previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas
i especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations
even though the screen fogs the lcd is still readbale
the only reason i gave it  stars is because i think the price is a bit high for a shower radiothe only reason this doesnt get a  is because it isnt very loud
i honestly didnt expect it to be especially with a single speakereverything else works as advertised
i can get tvamfmweather stations well
the old curtis shower radio i had was very spotty
digital tuning is awesome
the old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal
the presets work wonderfully and the timer feature was an added bonusonly time will tell if it lasts though
the curtis died after a year and a half
if the sony lasts that long i will be more than happyi purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna
the radio sounds nice and is easy to use but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception
he is very happy with the radioupdate ive had the unit now for about two years
it still works fine although the material covering the onoff button has worn completely off
actually it started wearing off after less than a year
in light of the fact that this is designed to be a shower radio this is really an inexcusable flaw after all you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio
fortunately i never used the radio in the shower itself
but still id have to take at least one star even two stars off for this defect which i know other reviewers have commented on as wellthe radio was a little smaller than i expected but thats good
it takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive
the reception is generally very good although i tend to listen to only one station  kpcc
still i had trouble getting good reception with my last radio an aiwa so the sony is a big improvement
occassionally i still get a little static depending on where i am standing in relation to the radio but overall i would give it a score of  in terms of reception i still occassionally get some static
i also tested all of the tv stations and the sony had no problem tuning them all in
no static to speak of although the volume was low
i would definitely recommend this radiothe sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this
i have to crank it fairly high to hear when im taking a shower even though its waterproof i dont put in the shower with me
however theres not distortion at high volumei cannot say anything about the battery life yet but overall im very satisfied with the radiothis radio is nice with digital display and nice membrain push buttons
the battery capacity is good lasts a long time the thing that is disapointing is that you can not recieve any weather stations even though other radios in the area do
also the am reception is no better than the  year old radio i replacedsony does it again
they have put together a great radio for the bathroom
it is easy to set up the time presets etc
the sound and reception are great
the controls are on top and protected
the display could be brighter and i wish it had a way to hang it on the wall when not in use it comes with a cord for hanging in the shower but it is compact and does not take up too much space on the counter and it looks nice
i havent actually put it in the shower since i can hear it just fine from the counterive been using these for over a year now
basically in a quiet environment these sound pretty good
they arent as good as similarlypriced studioclass headsets but youre paying for the noise cancelling
the raw capability is pretty decent and has acceptable detail in treble vocal and bass rangesthe noise cancelling works pretty well
ive taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids
they also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices which is nice in the officehowever i must have pretty big ears and ive found that the foam cups arent quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear
after  or  hours of use my ears start to ache a bitthe cord is plenty long and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional sony wired remote control
an adapter to convert the standard th inch stereo jack to the dual th inch jacks in many airplane seats is includedthe thing that i dont like about this is that i find these uncomfortable when i try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep
i think that the mdrncs might have been a better choice in that regardtheyre also kind of bulky unless you have a large carryon to keep them in
im paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me since the mdrncs come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the bose headsets
i havent had any spills yet but active travellers may wish to find a case thats more rigidall in all im pretty happy with these
the natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price i couldnt justify the  for bose unless i needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcupsthese tapes worked nicely in my old jvc camcorder
they did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back though
for some reason other tapes didnt do this
but it was a very faint sound and i am happyi recommend this products but today may concorde not use more but it is good  when i have  years agoworked just as i needed i know its old style but hey this works for me and my older video camerathese maxell  mm camcorder tapes are a pretty good product
i bought these years ago when i needed to borrow my brothers camcorder that requires  mm tapes
nowadays theyre getting harder and harder to find as everything now is digitalhard disk
the picture and sound quality on these tapes isnt quite as good as the more expensive  mm metal tapes but its decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments
i swear the picture and sound quality on the  mm camcorders and  mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the topoftheline hard disk camcorders
i have a hard disk camcorder but sometimes i wish i had an  mm camcorderi recommend these maxell  mm tapes but i would try to get the metal kind if you want really good picture and sound qualitypretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter  out of  timeshaving used a paper daytimer for years i was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing
boy have i been converted
the palm iiix my second palm  the first being a iii is for  me a great valueit has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive notetaking yellow page totin workaholic among us
i  download an average of  palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all
i also keep about  phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times  it has the  improved screen and processor versus the iii
and it has the benefit of  the palm community of software developers that is what sets palm devices  apart from windows ce and other devicesi like the foldover cover  both for protection and for the star trek communicator look  and feel
the backlight takes a little getting used to
it is not useful at all for  dim daylight use but works just fine in dark situationsi really want  the palm vx for the sexy size and industrial feel but i have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything i need and more and  costs a lot lessthe big questions these days is what organizer to get
ill assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the palm os beats ce any day
so the choice is a palm vx a palm v a iiix or a visor
i cant recommend the visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with handspringmaybe in another year but not nowthe new vx  is a good choice lots of memory and the other advantages of the palm v  like a better screen and rechargeable battery
but the darn thing is still  overpriced
if money is no problem though id probably go with the vxthe v is good too but only  meg of memoryyuck
now  meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people
if all you want to do is the  basic appointmentphone booktodo stuff  meg is more than youll ever  need
but thats ityoure stuck with  meg and cant upgrade easily
if you are interested in using your palm to do internet stuff grab  webpages with avantgo play games read books etc
youre going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by  meg
you can still do quite a bit but its a  bit more work to manage your spacenow for less money you can get the  iiix
youll have twice as much memory and the ability to upgrade
i  personally put on the trg xtra xtra pro board which gave me  meg more of  ram and  meg more flashits like having an  meg palm
really great
of course i bought this before the palm vx came out today its not quite  as good a deal to doone other reason i like the palm iiix is that i  have a lot of addons that only work with itthe palm navigator  compass the weatherguide landwares govox voice recorder etc
i dont  believe these will fit a palm v of course it goes both wayspalms new   modem and the new wireless omnisky modem only fit the palm vi do  believe the palm v has a better screen it doesnt seem to have the streaks  that a lot of the palm iiixs have
and theres no doubt it has a certain  quotcoolnessquot factor
most of my friends at work went with the palm  v but they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories i have  for my palm iiixthis is a simple no frills no gimmicks radio
believe it or not it was hard to find a radio with those qualities
modern radios are teenytiny and have tons of quotfeaturesquot
i needed this radio for someone who was visually impaired had severe arthritis and was well beyond the age of dealing with multifunctional gadgets
fortunately 
ge is still in the business of making things quotthe old fashioned wayquotto me the ge brand has always meant quotcheaply madequot
to be fair it once meant superior quality and cuttingedge innovation but ge along with general motors and a few other quotsuper conglomeratesquot took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century
now theyre madly playing catchup and this little radio even though its a throwback is the first sign ive seen that theyre making progressits a simple amfm radio
its a little too bulky has very nice monoraural sound and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers
still its just what i needed and its the first ge product ive intentionally purchased in over thirty years
either my standards are coming down or theyre actually improving their qualityi bought this radio in order to listen to an am station in my area that is very weak
prior to getting this radio i couldnt get it to come in on any radio in my house
now i can get it very strong and clear
the only complaint i have is that the dials on the front for volume etc
dont seem well made and seems like they could break or come off
since i leave it on the same station and same volume all the time it probably wont be a problem
it also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels
its pretty lightweight plastic
but the only reason i got it was to receive this one station and it does that job wellmost radios you can buy have pretty cabinets nice paint and will sound pretty good if youre tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg
theyre designed to impress you in the big box store where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on
it isnt until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in realworld performance trying to pick up that weak station thats the only one carrying the game you want to hearthe ge superadio is a whole nother dealits just an amfm radio aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever
but its the gold standard of the type
when a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on fm and especially am she will compare it to the superadioto give you an idea how good it is i live in a semiremote area without any really strong am stations
sitting side by side on my couch a typical personal stereo type radio picks up one am station
a cheap transistor radio picks up three
the superadio picks up i recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits
for one thing it will run about two hours less than forever on its six dcells
for another this set can pull in am stations at least two three hundred miles away in daylight any time
if your blackout extends farther than this radios range youve got more important things to worry aboutincidently it runs off ac also
it switches to ac automatically when you plug it in switches back to batteries automatically if ac isnt availablesound quality is excellent
its mono but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly
it also has separate treble and bass controlsi give it four stars instead of five for three reasons  some of them dont work
the first one i bought didnt
stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the am band
theyre packed very tightly together there and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly
the wide bandwidth is useless to me
there is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it
i have to use the narrow setting intended for weak and distant stations for everythingstill its a heck of a radio for remote areas for camping trips or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darni got this radio to pull in both remote stations and to have better reception
i also wanted something batterypowered for emergency purposes in case of power failuresearthquakes etcfirst impression is that this is one big ugly heavy radio
that impression never goes away because it is big ugly and heavy
the apparent workmanship fit and finish looks like it was put together in the dark  by a developmentallychalleneged monkey who had lost the instructions
it just looks frankly awful
cheap plastic poorly made with all sorts of color swirls with chrome paint
about like the interior of a mids chevyit uses no fewer than  d cells
but the radio is so big you hardly notice
most of the size comes from the  diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it
it probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic
theres also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers
all the knobs and switch seem like they will fall of at any moment and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable
it has a handle and while you can carry it around its a portable radio in the same sense that the original beige toaster k macintosh was portableas far as entertainment products go this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the ipod nanoyou might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a  woofer and a about a  tweeter
but no  the sound quality overall it not very good at all
it always sounds tinny and while its plenty good enough for am voice its really not much better on fmbut by golly it does have absolutely terrific am reception
right away all theproblem stations i had before were perfectly clear
with a terk loop antenna i spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the kw clear channel stations i could get
with care in tuning the antenna and the radio i got the hartford ct station on the first try
didnt last too long but i got it
this from sunnyvale california
its relatively easy to get stations in wyoming and nebraska on good nights
seattle la salt lake no problem anytime even with the internal antennathe tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you cant reliably set the radio using the existing marks
i just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencilone thing that i didnt see in the other reviews or anywhere else except the instructions is that the radio is capable of being set to use  khz bandwidth instead of the usual  meaning you get a lot better sound than normal
the speakers stink but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed
of course you want narrow for longdistance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bitthe fm performance is nothing to write home about hardly any different from any other radio you might buy
it has afc to help control the drift and it seems to work just fine
but its a mono radio and the speaker quality limits the sound quality
its bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long
there are tone controls but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it
if you want a goodsounding fm radio get the tivoli model one
its about x the price but the sound is about x better
its clear to me that virtually all the price of the ge went into the am receiver part and the rest of it was compromised to meet the very low pricewith the huge battery pack i suspect it will run a very very long time on one set
of course it can also use accrudity aside the radio works exactly as advertised has brilliant am reception will probably run forever on a set of batteries and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really cant go too wrongps
to clarify my review is for the ge version not the rca version which is still big ugly and poorly made  and also has terrible performance
the ge version works well the rca does notas someone who worked for the ge audio division back when the first superadio was developed i can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece
the engineers had their ge radio reputations on the line and the concept of good mono vs bad stereo obviously had market appealover the years inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made i was part of some of these types of discussions as well but when i was looking for a good portable radio this version was high on the list
we have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound
one problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out but thats why we have amazon righti bought the original version of this radio back in the late s
weve had this one for over two years
its a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shopwork use
we left it in the vegas sun and it melted the case a little
it still worksit is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception i live in an area where some people cannot get half of what i get on this unitbuy again because of performanceyesbuy again  maybe not because of size being so largeive owned my ge superadio iii for about  months now
id heard a lot of mostly favorable things about this legendary series of radios and had to get one
im glad i did
heres what i thinkstrong points  great am reception
even during the day its not difficult to pick up stations up to a couple of hundred miles away
at night it can be several hundred miles
this radio has an  ferrite antenna and when you hook up an external antenna like the c crane twin ferrite it really gets good  very good fm reception although i must admit i mostly just listen to am talk radio
  big way speaker puts out nice full sound  separate bass and treble controls  very long battery life  dcells  ac cord included but not used most of the time
  great value
you could easily spend  or  times as much to get a radio that doesnt approach this performancenotsostrong points  its a big radio
it wont fit in your pocket or briefcase but its no boombox either  the analog tuning dial is not very accurate as noted by many others
  build quality is about middle of the road
but still good for the price
  no presets no clock no weather band no swi currently do not own a c crane radio plus which i find the superadio iii most often compared to but its also  the pricei own a lot of radios more than  at last count
i listen to this one almost every day for at least part of the day so i think that says somethingif youre looking for a relatively inexpensive but highly appreciated gift for a talk radio fan this is it
if youre looking for a cool radio for a young person this probably aint it
if youre into talk radio or you want to have some fun with am dxing then get one for yourselfi bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion
its showing signs of wear now doesnt tune like it used to and the antenna doesnt stand up anymore keeps flopping over but the superradio has been more than worth the money although i dont remember buying it for as much as they want for it hereit is my misfortune to live in a fringe fm reception area  the station i regularly listen to is  miles away
i have tried various combination shortwaveamfm radios  over the past few years and none had better than soso sound on fm
id read about this radio for many years and when i saw it on amazon  figured it was worth a try
i have been very pleasantly surprised
the radio is very large but has very large speakers that combined with separate bass and treble controls produce a very good quality sound
the tuner section is highly sensitive even on fm
after i loaded the six d cells into it i have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now
the build quality is a little cheesy but if it werent it would weigh as much as an anchor
if you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and dont mind a large portable this is a winneri loved my sriii
solid sound quality excellent am receptivity but only average fm receptivitybut it wasnt very hardy
i took it camping once and it was never the same after that
it took several minutes to warm up after you turned it on and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that
and scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume
i figure the radio didnt like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morningsome products seem to predict their own futures
corning ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zappernow the ge  superadio iii takes its place among such prescient products
your humble communications technician seeking to hear another human voice  while on the job in a computer room found the superadio iii remarkably  well suited to the computer room environmenti had previously brought a  grundig yacht boy  and a sony icf to work to listen to an am talk  radio station only to find out that what makes them so good for world band  shortwave reception are the very things that meant disaster in the  computer rooms emi electromagnetic interference rich atmosphere
being  digital receivers their computerlike circuits eagerly plucked from the  air the squeals drones and squawks of the network servers pcs and pbx  system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the  weakened signal
i pondered the possibilities for better reception
i  could put the radio nearer an exterior wall crank up the volume loud  enough to hear while seated at my desk and be promptly thrown into the  parking lot since others in the room dont really want to hear the same  station
through the interference on the sony came a commercial for the  ccradio by c crane a tabletop receiver specially designed for long  distance reception of am news and talk radio stations translation the  speaker aint so hot for music
pricey but perhaps worth iti read a  few reviews of the ccradio and another model kept popping up as the  undisputed champ of long distance am radio reception the standard against  which other contenders are measured the one the only ladies and  gentlemen lets hear it for the ge  superadio iii
wow i thought  how often i had seen them at walmart and kmart and how often i said to  myself yeah right superadio ha ha
yet here were some of the  toughesttoplease sobs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as the benchmark
i was intrigueda quick visit  to the usual suspects best buy walmart kmart proved fruitless  quotsorry if its not on the shelf were out
no i dont know when  well have morequot
in desperation i came to amazoncom typed  quotsuperadioquot in the search box and there it was in all its  quotusually ships in  hoursquot glory and for less than  the best street price
 ups second day air days later it was waiting for  me at home
i didnt unbox the radio until i was back at work the next  dayeven before digging into my sausage mcmuffin with egg breakfast i  unpacked the superadio iii plugged it in and was indeed amazed
the  interference no longer dominated the signal from los angeles radio station  kfi
it was still there but not as much as on the sony and grundig
the  superadio iiis analog tuner is by its nature more immune to it
throwing the widenormal switch to the normal position reduced much of the  interference
judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and  treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the  interference to a tolerable level
thanks to the speaker sound system  the superadio iii delivers more quotpresencequot allowing it to sound  louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior  soundat the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself
the  aforementioned station at  khz appears between the  and  markings   khz
if you do a lot of station hopping keeping a station list  with eachs position on the to quotlog scalequot above the am and  fm scales might be a good idea
made in china and imported by thomson  consumer electronics the superadio iii has a lessthansubstantial feel to  its construction and controls
betterbuilt radios do come out of china  can you say quotgrundigquot
but they also cost accordinglyfor  its price the ge  superadio iii portable amfm radio does just what  you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come  as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the  outside world inside
they can block your access to web radio but they  cant stop you from listeningit receives and plays mono radio am and fm exceptionally well
it sounds great with surprisingly good bassat xx it isnt small
and it it isnt light either with  d batteries in it
but ill bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so goodi bought it because i wanted a good inexpensive big verticalformat portable radio im tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today
i wish it had digital tuning but it doesnt
the analog dial might not be very accurate but in my experience analog tuning has never been accurate
ive always had to tune by ear rather than eyefeatures power switch button is separate from the volume control
so you wont be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on
bass and treble controls
a mono headphone out meant for stereo headphones  you get the same signal in each ear
loud
easily fills a goodsized room with sound
on am it has an optional wide mode which can give you really great sound on some am stations at the price of selectivity
on fm it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong fm signal you may wish to turn off afc for weak fm signals near strong stations
it has terminals for external fm and am antennas
it has a nice  long fm antenna and a cm internal ferrite rod for am
it has a nice handle on top the kind that bangs into the fm antenna if the antenna is extended so be careful
theres no light on the tuning dial
again you must tune by earheavy however doesnt necessarily mean hardy
everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille
since it is heavy and somewhat tall i fear the time when it first will fall over
best to treat this radio kindly  im not sure how long the switches will last
but for kindly indoor use assuming you dont like to switch stations often its greatwhat you are paying for here though is the reception which is excellent
the superadio iii is not a tankgood sound good options
a bit larger than you might think from the picture
sound is good as is reception
i have it on the back corner of the desk as background musici recently recieved this item
the reception is about the same as my grundig s
i took off  star  because on fm i cant get  cleary but my grundig can get it better
is it because the antena is too small
or is it that i need to modify it
the am reception is good
the sound is better than the grundig s
over all the radio is goodi only use superadio iii for fmplusses  selectivity and sensitivity are excellent and comparable to the tivoli pal which costs over 
  the sound quality for the spoken word is quite adequateminusesnote that to me the only significant minus is 
  the iiis reproduction of music is poortounacceptable
ive even tried playing music through up to eight iiis yes eight
to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification its not
  both iiis that have stopped working for me did so because the onoff silver button while appearing to be in the downon position in fact wasnt low enough to turn the iii on
fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case
  should you try to tune to the same station using multiple iiis at the same time as i do theres a noticeable variation between iiis in where on the dial that same station appearsconsiderations  sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on that is if the control were numbered from  to  it would be at 
  the bass control adds more distortion that bass
  the headphone jack takes a stereo mini plug even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural which i consider to preferable to a monaural jack because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs
  according the the users manual that normalwide button works only on am not fmi just purchased this radio
it has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over price and the quality of sound is very goodpros reception quality on both am and fm bands has a builtin power cord may use batteries as well attractive price for the quality you getcons a bit heavy i assume primarily due to speakers it has two one of which is quite large and builtin power adapter cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord i managed to back it back after several tries vernier nondigital tuning and no ability to preprogram stations at the same apparently due to excellent reception dial range for stations is very large so tuning to a station is not a problem at all builtin power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within  ft form the radio i assume this is not a problem when using batteriesi am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of am and fm receiving
its all true
but quality of product is just horrible
look i formerly lived in ukraine and soviet union and to tell you the truth i havent seen such horrible finish and quality in soviet portable radios
quality or a lack of it is just appalling
the tuning knob will fell off very soon
theres no soft material under battery doorso battery rattle i put some paper inside it cured rattle
i understand this product made in china but look you can buy sony grundig or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in china as a matter of fact almost everything nowdays made in china
its not a question whether or not something made in china its a matter how good it made there
this radio is obviously was made in garage in china
just tell me why but why theres no light on tuning scale how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb
ge seems not to care about quality of their product at all
i wouldnt ever buy this product for looks
it looks awful but reception on am is excellent yes it isexactly what i needed to use the touch screen on a alpha dc power rectifier
also works with a jdsu tberd i purchased this product to provide phone connection to my dss receiver
i do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem
this is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern
the product was easy to install and worked perfectly for this applicationi use the rc to add an extra phone jack for my directivos and standalone directv receiver
all three receivers are split off from the extension jack and i have never had a problem with the units making the required service data calledit i also have dsl but use wire filters not the generic filters provided by verizon for greater clarity
a filter has to be placed between the jack and the wireless base unit for the wireless extension unit to function properly with dslnote  tivos and directivos do have modems so rios title header is somewhat misleading
but the facts in the body of the review are correct
per page  of rcas manual which is available on their website note the maximum baud rate for the wireless phone jack is  best results however will be experienced at 
this limitation is why i knocked off a starso yes i would not recommend that you attempt to surf the internet using this jack or use it for any purpose where a high baud rate is important
but the phone jack is perfectly fine for voice fax and satellite receiver usethe only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button
i had it on the previous uniden headset
otherwise it works great and i am happy with the  i boughtheadset is comfortable and works well
i can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help
only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphonei purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system
the only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home
i used it a few time when i work on my computer and need help
sound quality is fine
if i had to do over i might have looked into a wireless
dont get me wrong it works fine
its that i dont really need it with my speaker phonesthis worked well to transfer a caller id signal to an area where i have a cable box and tv
this was very good for my needs but i did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets
i also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would talk to each other and transfer the caller id signal but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlesslyhad a small setup problem i needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone otherwise i use it on my tivo and it works just fine so farupdate several years later
this unit is really lousy
i called tivo for an unrelated issue one day and the guy on the phone said youre using one of those wireless modem things arent you  he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir
i didnt know because the tivo managed to mask the failures but after trying several online tivo updates i got to finding out how much this really doesnt work
i have a series  tivo now and am using an  network which is infinitely better and fasteri have used this wireless phone jack system to connect a directv receiver for over  months and for three months a tivo without a problem
the stations are about  feet apart with a wall and furniture in between but i have not had connectivity issues
i have two wireless networks b and gin the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned
that said my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a  ft lineofsight installation with no other wireless networks so the system seems to be somewhat pickyi bought two and use them in different parts of the house to listen to my sirius satelite radio
i can walk around the house and listen to either howard or the rolling stones channel through out using one boom boxthere are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these
 a  set the volume going into the transmiter higher
 low volume in will cause popping and fading
very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down
 higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level
when you increase the volume on the speakers you are amplifying the noise as well as the music
makes sense rightb the power cord is also part of the antenna so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception
i used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands
the cord runs straight down like a verticle antennac the speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence
you can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers speakers
fine tune them for the best reception in your location
this may take a few adjustsments
remember cellphones wifi etc can all interferei tried plugging the transmitter into my stereos headset jack but it didnt work well because the output was too low
im going to cut the plugs off of the y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear effects channel of my home theateri love these speakers and use them everyday
they could be a little better but i still love them
id give them  stars if they were a little louder a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better
youd get  in an open feild or gymnasium not my odd shaped house
but for the money they are a great valuemy house is made concrete  steel and has metalic tinted glass all over so wireless stuff doesnt work the greatest
with my windows closed  the tranmitter on my patio i get about  with occaisional drift
your house might be better
im going to buy another pair because i see that they are discontinued and these sound better than the newer ones
im also concerned that the new ones may have differnt frequencies which is a good thing if you want to use more than one pair at a time connected to different inputsbetter hurry up and buy now before i get buy allhaving spent  hours with the magellan  on a camping weekend in arizonas mountains i can say that the unit is all thats advertised
the manual is cryptic but once you get used to the customizing menus and  available navigation screens the rest is pretty intuitive
i was able to create a waypoint walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within  feet
it works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest
it was showing an estimated rms positional error of only  feet at one point
routes are given in  foot increments when you are within  miles of your waypoint with the updated software you can download from the magellan website
as long as you keep moving the compass feature is quite good
it even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dialnice screen plenty of options and quite accurate
when used in your car it tracks your speed to  mph with updates given each second
if you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover this is a nice addition
i suspect on an open lake this would be super for locating favorite fishing spotsscreen smallhard to read while drivingbattery eater
i use the dc adapter howeverno mapsnot enough contrast on screen
with sunglasses while driving cant see screentiny print on quotgotoquot destination
impossible to read while drivinggood quick operation once you learn itdoes everything it says it willi like it except for the above thingsi bought  prs of these about  years ago for an extended trip
 plane rides later we were all happy with the purchase
i dont think the stewardesses were happy that we didnt have to buy headphones though but they worked well and we were able to hear the inflight movie and the movies on our portable dvd players
 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home
however two pair are still functioning quite well
saw these at this reduced price and i just bought  more pair for some travelling this summer
i dont get into all the techie stuff that others do i just say if it works well greatthis is an awesome laptop for its price
only one complaint as others have mentioned problems with the power jack
within a month it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging
took it back to the store i got it and they gave me a brand new one one the spot
but several months later the new one had the same problem
brought it back again
this time i had to wait  weeks to get it repaired
two months later same problem
another  week repair
im striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in but heck its a laptop
anyway if it happens a fourth time my warranty says they have to give me a new onethe sound quality is good the fit comfy and the closefitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the nr on
when you turn on the nr though youll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background humyes
i dont even listen to music with these
i put them on turn them on and then just sleep for the flightawesomeive had the maxell nc ii over a couple of years  they are still holding up welli now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed napi originally got them because i was a long haul truck driver  the engine  wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear itthese headphones helped to stop thatthe noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed stress free environmentat the end of the day i wasnt nearly as tired as when i didnt use the headphonesim not an audiophile so i cant give you stats  freq s but i enjoy my music books on tape  movies more using these headphonesi also like the collapsible over the ear design
they are comfortable  i havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended timethe battery life is very good the electrical cord is a good length  the onoff switch is sturdy with a small green light when onim going to upgrade to the nc iv for home  keep my nc ii for in the carmaxell manufactures excellent  minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording
as long as you have the right kind of equipment these tapes record the sounds of record albums radio shows cdrs people talking and more
these tapes have  minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are  blank minutes for recording on each side
the features of this tape as one reviewer correctly notes make it good for recording lectures and music using standard less expensive home stereo equipment
the tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your carif you pay the amazon price of  for the fifteenpack you spend roughly  cents per tape and thats very inexpensive
the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times and they take up very little room so theyre easy to carry around with youunfortunately these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you
this means that if hypothetically you were to copy a cdr onto another cdr instead of a maxell cassette tape the quality of the sound on the cdr copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you
maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the maxell xlii but its still not the same as a digitized cdr recording
moreover cassette tapes can break if not handled with care
they can also break if used a few too many times too
therefore i recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup
these shortcomings frustrate me and therefore i will have to take off one star to make this a four star reviewthe tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible
if you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole
the cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recordingoverall maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music the radio people talking or anything you wish to record
i have used this brand for decades and i cannot think of any major complaints
i highly recommend maxell normal bias  minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tapeso far i have been able to use these cassettes over and over again with no problems in the quality of sound produced by them i really enjoy the blank tapes as i am able to do what i need to get done no problemsthese are really nice tapes they record well the first time and rerecord over and over
still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work welli have used maxwell for some time
i liked the price and having used these in the past you can retape over them many many times
i use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime
you get good clear pictures even after several months of taping
i would reorder these again
also there are few if any places locally to purchase any brand of vhs tapesi still use videotapes for easy uncomplicated recording of things i dont plan on keeping indefinitely
ive used two tapes from the pack i bought and they are just fine
no problems so far
am rating  rather than  only because i havent been using them long and i havent done much rerecording which is something else i do
i may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy themthe answer is me hahayup i am living in the s
i have three vcrs that and still enjoy watching or buying discount vcr movies or old ones i have filmed
and yes guilty as charged i still use them to tape shows i have missed
this is a good value for the  pack and i tape over them after watching whatever i have taped and so far no issues
i think you can tape over about  times before the quality starts droppingmaxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products
bought these because i still use a video recorder
have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them gothese vhs tapes are good but after i got them i realized that i needed more time but this was no fault of the manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter nowi have found them at another website with more hours
now i just have to remember how to use them to my advantageexcellent pack of tapes
been buying maxwell for years now and never have had any problems or been unhappy at allgood tapes that can be recorded many times and are easy to remove from box
if you still use tapes use thesenot the highest fidelity you will ever hear in a headphone but if you arent in a recording studio and are just listening to music while sitting at home or cleaning or watching the tv and want headphones so as not to disturb the neighbors these are perfect
they have more than enough range  i can even go well outside and still hear the music just fine
they are not quite five stars though due to not being fully fi so to speak and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteriesas far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning maybe i just lucked out but i had these things tuned in about three seconds
ive also never lost a signal randomly or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained
i will say though that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob and its very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones or when one wants to adjust the volume
but this is a minor complaint though i would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume or in some other less easily accesible spotthe lows are good the highs are good and the ear cushions are very comfy even for my large head for extended periods
the cushions i find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating sorry if thats gross but you need to know this stuff to be informed
ive always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many many ages ago and so is not a problem with just these headphones but the advents cause it sooner than others i have owned  they make a very airtight seal around your earsfor the price and for the builtin rechargable batteries these are an excellent deal in my opinion and ive enjoyed having them and using them and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and i both can use them to watch movies with explosions andor loud orchestral soundtracks late at nightfine sound good reception over a decent range looks like i can get around the yard without them making any big complaints comfortablei would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds im used to
and the separation is better than i expected
there is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on but im pretty picky and i think its totally tolerableoverall very pleased with the product
the phones are lightweight comfortable and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house amp yard
the quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good
there is an ample supply of cables amp adapters ie for plugging into  a computer soundcardmy cars  cd changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel
because the right channel remained ok i did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue
i figured both left and right channels should be affected
i lamented over my player for weeks because i could illafford whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy bose cd player embedded in the dashboard of a car
i gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred
finally i figured what have i got to lose just to find out if this is a dirt problem
 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay
hola macarolaill be darned if this disc didnt cure my player immediately
i wish i had given this thing a shot a lot sooner
technically there was problem though
the instructions say the cd has sound
its supposed to alert you when its done cleaning or whatever
my product produced no sound at any time
i inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc
it ran and ran and ran
it never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own
i simply had to eject it
i deducted one star only because of this technicalitythis cd cleaner has more brushes to do a little more cleaning to a cd player but its not advanced enough for a car cd playeri purchased item for my pclaptopboomboxdvd playerjust for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirtdust after using it on all of  items their was a coat of dustdirt on discwow what a surprise i try to keep my electronics clean   dust free every  months but dustdirt seem to find its way inside electronicshad old movies that we were unable to view because they kept skipping
gave them a good cleaning and all were view ablei have a netflix subscription and receive dvds in the mail
there are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them
rather than send it back because it wont play correctly i give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every dvdthere is really not much you can say about a clean wipe
the product does clean fingerprints on the dvd
im very satisfied with the product
if it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even betterthese cd or dvd wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups
they are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good
i was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that i had so in fact i ended up just buying a new dvd of the same recordingbut its a good product for maintenance
i guess the lesson i learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used
also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old lp recordingso i did in fact also learn something from the instructions as wellvery handy
and reusable
well now i have to provide more words handy handy handy
i just need to remember to use especially on rental dvdsi just needed a product to quickly wipe down my rented movies or used dvds and cds i purchase online or at garage sales etc
so far it appears to work well
nice pricei have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie dvds
typically i clean them by breathing on the dirty dvd and using the inside of my tshirt to wipe clean these dvds
however i began to look for another solution that didnt involve my tshirt
this product  the allsop cd and dvd fastwipes looked like a possible solution so i ordered a packafter giving them a try i find they work well  they dont get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help or in my case a breath on the dvd but they get about  percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily
the material is lint free and works as advertised
 cddvd shaped wipes come per pack
being shaped like a dvd is just a gimmick
i usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping so if they were squareshaped and thus had a little more material it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle
the instructions say that each wipe can be reused until it becomes visably dirty or worn so you can clean multiple dvds per wipeoverall these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price
four starscable ties works as they are promised to
was able to organize the cables behind the tv looks much better
preferred to use these over the smaller ties the larger velcro straps allow multiple larger cables to be bundled togetherthey work as i expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last wordsthese little cable ties may not be of the highest quality but they do work and you sure get a great deal considering the pricethere is only velcro on part of the strip so i dont know how long the tie would last if  you were tying and untying it all the time
what i have found is that if i just tie something up and leave the cable types alone these work greati am happy with themi use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords
they are long enough to do a great job nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cablei recommend themthis is cool and all but i was a little upset when i found out i could buy it at the dollar store for about half the pricethey are simple and easy to use
the eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle
i bought  them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which i trim them to about  inches in lengththis is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires
they are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properlypicture sizing out spagetti for two people big
if you need it for a few small wires it wont work as well
these are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material
i see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computerbelkin has never let me down
i had order  of these packages and used them all  and am ordering more
im also ordering a longer length versioni love the fact that they work well dont separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome
my husband hates seeing cables all mess  i always have a spare set for him
all the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason whythese work for just about anything that you might need them for
there are only six in the package so you dont get very manyif you are looking for something to bundle your cords together or if you have mess behind your tv andor computer i would suggest these to help you get the cords organizedthese are the typical hook and loop solution
they are mostly loop and towards the end there is a  piece of loop sewn on
i found this to be rather stiff and didnt readily bend to conform to the cables i was wrapping
 is a nice length but much longer than what i needed so i ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it
you could probably cut an end off but i like longer ties as it seems im constantly moving things around and i get very frustrated when i find something a few inches short
if the  hook part were not as stiff id give it the extra starfine little velcro ties
the ties lack a tie to the cable i use them for extension cords
if they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then i would rate  starsi dont have much to compare these to except for the heavy duty version that i use for power cables and extension cords in the garage
these are obviously light duty
works great for computer and game cables
they are atrong enough to hold my hdmi switch box strapped to the pole of my computer desk to make it easily accessiblethe only thing i wish these had was some means to loop through so that they could be attached securely to one end of the cable
otherwise i just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together and now its permanently tethered to one endi guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available
what if you want to have only one colour for your cables so that they dont end up being in your partners case
and i suppose the colours couldve been brighterbut they do look nice and theres plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped upthese ties are great for something you repeatedly bundle and unbundle like a laptop power cord
theyre slightly expensive per strap but are worth it in my opinionnice for small cable bundling but not enough velcro for large bundlesworks great in computer cases for cable dressingsame review from me as for the case logic cable ties
these are fine but because theyre only grippy on about an inch at the end they really only work well on larger cables like power cords and ethernet cables etc
i wanted them to wrap up all the little headphone and micro usb cables that i have cluttering my backpack
and these definitely are not good for those size cables
the colors are nice and will help you corral cables at your deski use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords
they work great i use to use twist ties which worked but these are just so much nicer
the entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part
they come in multi colorsgot these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center
in essence they work
they are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords holding them in one neat bundle
they arent really meant for identifying cables  but for holding several in a bundle
because they work great i cant give them less than  stars
 and change is pretty cheap but if you wanted you could do the same job with much cheaper products  which is why i didnt give it  starssummary works great
cheap but cheaper options availablebasically needed a longer cord for my usb hub
the stock cable that came with it was so short
didnt want to spend a ton of  but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed
this did the job without breaking the bankwould recommendextremely low price at a high quality made
the cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at storesthis makes it much easier to plug and unplug usb devices
also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in
i measured it to be sure and it is  feet and an inch  so they did not short me on the length at all
i recommend this quality productit works
i use it to plug portable hard drives into
the through put seems pretty good
it works finethis simple usb extension cable seems to be very well made
it has heavy molded connectors and a flexible insulation on the cable
extended my tablet charging cable and works just as it is supposed to doif you want to use your newly purchased  ibm model m keyboard with a modern computer using a ps interface
pthis is the power cable i needed to use with my desktop pc and it worked wonderfully
the fit on both ends was snug and secure
i didnt experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all
it plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally
pc powered up immediately on first try  which really doesnt need to be saidthe bonus  its really cheapchoose this product from a reputable mfg
to try and extend my computer reach before making a permanent installation in my homethe cable is of good quality and had worked without problem
the terminations are easy to plug in and remove
there have been no performance issues with this cableits a cable what does one say about a product like this
i wanted one and i now have itthis cable performed perfectly
the data transmission speeds were every bit as fast as i had hoped and the cable was not bothered by being in direct sunlighta regular long ethernet cord that shows no signs of wear
however it does not catch in ethernet slots it sometimes slips outusually its better than averagebut this one is not as good as i bought before
i have quiet few belkins items and i like trust this brand
everything would be fine if not for the cheap plastic plugs if ur intend to unplugreplug it often than i recommend other brandbelkin screwed up on this one thought its cheapdont like itthrow it in the garbagethe pink cable was like  when i bought it so you really cant beat the price
its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine
the connectors are pretty good the only negative i have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile if you push them sideways very much they come right off
but honestly you dont need those  they can even be annoying in tight spaces and for  the quality cant be beatgreat quality cable 
what i mean to say is it is well made and has decent insulation tonot disturb the flow of information between that and your modemnd finally able to color match some of your cables so they actually add to the look of your rig or ambiancei would reccomendthese cablesi got this cord for under  and it lasted almost a year before the plastic ends broke
i unplugged and replugged it in one or more time a day and was satisfied with it for how much abuse i put it throughits a patch cable
i hooked my xbox and dvd player to my router and can now access the internet on bothi used this cable to hook up my bluray player to a ethernet switch
it was inexpensive and works great
would recommend ityou cant beat the price but if i were to buy one in the future i would get a  or ft
i bought it for my bedroom and ft is pretty short to reach everywhere i wantits cat  cable with an rj on each end
what else is there to say
its portable and worksi cant complain too much  its cat cable whats there to say
its a good price and i like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management
but this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than i am used to and i do not like that at all
in order to press the plastic release for the connector you have to fit your finger between two raised edges
clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem and i appreciate the attemptbut this was too hard to use couldnt release it with my thumb had to use my index finger
plus you cant do it from the side you have to have your finger at the correct angle which can be a problem when youre under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have youthere were needed in my computertv setup
they arrived on time
and they seem sturdy and well made
note that they are a full feet longits a good cable
the only thing i would change on it is to make the snagless attachment more like what is on the cables to go   its just a better design but this one still does the jobworks as designed the price is just right 
i will  recommend this item to my friend it works with the proper lengthat this price its probably a knock off but it shows m across so i dont care
i guess the snagless clips are pretty nice tooit works greati bought them to replace the ones i have in use that have broken clips
next time i pull my computer mess err desk apart i will replace themthe cable did its job
it arrived on time and was as expected
i needed a cat  cable to hook another pc to my networkya this thing is pretty cool
i bought it to connect one electronic thing to another and to my surprise it worked
data is being transmitted as i type this thanks to this cordthey worked fine and are well made
its a cable but now i have to add  more words  therethese are well made cables with good features such as the molded guard for the release lever to keep it from catching when the cable is pulled back out of an  installationbelkin feet cate snagless patch cable gray arrived before the due date and it was pachaged well
i sure like the color issue
all my cables are colored and i log them in a note book for easy accessi like the snagless connection feature
otherwise its your basic belkin ethernet cable for home or office networks
its goodgreat cable
this cable is very rugged to use the tab protectors are great since is really protects the tabexactly as advertised and shown
nice quality snagfree meaning it has a molded ridge on the cable end to help try to avoid snagging the port clip and fully molded not crimped cables
a good buy especially with prime shippingworks well
i needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way but allow me to move away from my desk  foot
i can enjoy higher speeds with this cat e cable connected vs my wireless connection
i like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakagebelkin international inc is a american manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices headquartered in los angeles california
i feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a american companyi have purchased belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use
i have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic cat e cables
this is the reason for my interest in belkins snagless design
without the locking tabs the cables slip out if movedi brought this cable when my old cable broke
im use it to connect my computer and wireless route together
its a good cableit was really cheap and shipped quickly
not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works
i needed a second one and this one did the trickjust what they siad it would be and it works just fine
the color helps to see which item is pluged into which porti needed to work on an old computer and needed more ps link
works as expected as an extension cablei installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity
a salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them but for  you just cant beat these speakers
they are easy to set up
anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with themi bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool
i am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box
if you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit
i am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage areai bought these several years ago for listening outside on my  acres of property speakers for my backyard but i can hear these from the front yard and when im in the woods too
i bought these as a cheap unknown brand speaker that i could use and abuse while leaving them out in all weather conditionsrain snow ice and a few hurricanes through the years and getting knocked around by kids
the sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations
the overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than i thought they would  years now and all year long outdoor usage
due to the fact that i crank up the volume very high for when im mowing or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party with or without other people      im now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on its way out
it still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other  just a good all around speaker that does not break the banki have had my zip drive for almost  years and it has worked great
although the performance of the drive has been great i find that the media to be too expensive and much larger than the comparable ls drives
another suggestion is your buying this drive to use it for fast access to  your files dont go with the parallel
instead go with the internal ide  or the scsi
both of these are at least twice as fast as a parallel drivethis slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch
it is also lightweight and compact and it will store your palm as well as some business cards andor credit cards
i personally preffer the hard cover  which has a more modern look and protects the palm better
nonetheless i  use the slim leather case when i go to elegant social events because it is  slimmer and less heavy so it is easier to carry in your coat pocketthis is a nice case
bought it for my dads m and out of the box it didnt fit because the stylus insert is too large for the accessory slide but he was able to modify the case so that it does fit
he likes itthis is a decent case for carrying your palmpilot
a lightweight metallic case with hinges might be better
actually i dont know anybody that carries this device and i havent for  years but the case was goodthis was the first case that i had for my palm
there is no doubt that it a good case and it looks really nice with the vx
with the case on it very little to the overall size of the palm
the silo design of the vx which allows you to attach the case to the palm was ingenious
it a huge leap in case design compared to the velcro concept of may pdasas for this case it is made of high quality leather and it a loopstrap design that i also liked
velcro and the button proved that after prolonged use it tends to rip
the loopstrap design secures the case very well and it still looks very eleganthowever like many leather products they tend to warp and deform after a while
just think of your wallet and how deformed that can get
if your going to be putting it in your pocket a lot i suggest you go with the hard case
however if your going to be putting it in a bag or brief case then this case will be finealthough the case has slots for credit cards or business cards realistically you wouldnt want to put more than two credit card and  business cards in it at one time
it does a lot to the bulkiness of the case
personally i only carried  business cards in it at one timereatively speaking i wanted a case that was smaller then this one because it got a little too big for my pockets whether it be the shirt or pant pocket
i found that not only was the hardcase by palm smaller and almost weighed as much it also protected it just as wellalso the fact that the powerbutton was often times turn on when using the leather case convinced me to change to the hard casedont get me wrong
i really like this case
the hard case just fit my needs for a case a lot better then the slim leather casethe best thing i can suggest is to try both of them out before you actually buy it
a lot of stores will let you try on the case
thats really the best way to determine which one will really work for youi wonder if this will fit the m series hmmmunlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so this product is rather straight forward
first and foremost i must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case which is also manufactured by  com in both form and function
second it can hold credit cards and money  to be used as a second wallet although it is not a great idea to use it as  a primary substitute
and thirdly the hard case is about ten dollars more  than the leather case and is not nearly as goodhowever like all  things it does have its downsides
its biggest flaw like with other  cases is that it makes placing the palm in the craddle while still in the  case a little more difficult
you basically need to place the craddle up  on something upsidedown cup for example and pull back both sides of the  case all the way and then you can recharge
secondly the pockets are made  so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards  into or out of the pockets which is why you might want to stick to a  regular wallet
and thirdly if you place the cased palm in a tight space  like a bag or something there is a chance that the edge of the case will  hit the power button and cause it to turn on
this is not a big deal since  it will shut off automatically after a minute or so however it can become  annoying when you havent charged your palm in a while and you find that  your battery is dying for some strange reasonall in all you cant do  much better than this case for only  and while there may be more  expensive cases on the market they are all variations of this simple  design
however i would say that it would be nice it com or palm would  make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection  on all sides since something can get caught between your palm and the case  and end up scratching the screen which almost happened to mefinal  thoughts nice leather dont expect it to take the same beating as the  hard case but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm dont shovel  out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case get this nice leather one  insteadrevuman  stay tuned for more reviewspeaceone of the nice features of the palm v is its slim size
if the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit cardcash pockets it would definitely be a plusi have not had the accidental turn on  problems others have had but i think when the case softens up a bit after  use this could be a serious issue
ive got friends who switched over to  the hard case which isnt as quotsumptuousquot but fits well will  not accidently push any of the buttons and is a bit thinnerthis product does its job which is to protect the palm
they can and do break you know if you drop them without protectionthe strap holds the palm in the case securely as does the ingenious snapin docking mechanism
there are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash
but this only works as a wallet in a pinchon the down side the case does roughly double the depth of the palm vx but the way i see it thats the price of protectioni bought my first zip drive parallel port a long time ago and replaced it with a usbacadapter model a while later
i am still using it and it works
the disks have a higher failure rate than the drive but heystill working after all these yearsi bought this to read some old zip disks i had lying around
i wanted to save the old files
i bought my zip drive from thirdparty seller elizabethleehr and even though it was used it ran on my win laptop flawlessly
no driver needed pure plugnplay
of course zip drives eventually all develop the clickdeath syndrome so i can only rate this  starsadapter works fine  laptop is  years old but everything worked fine
good price at amazoni just plugged it in and it simply worked  both on my powerbook  running os  which exploits it as an extended memory hack and on my titanium powerbook running os  and os x i have iphoto set not to launch when the card is inserted on the tibooki gave  stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles
to merit  stars it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guideit does what is says it does the only downside i can think of is that it does not have an eject button for the cf card so when the card fits tight you have to remove the pcmcia card to actually get the cf card outthis is a very high quality leather case with good hardware
my laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything
the almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords
there isnt a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge
the velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone
a few snaps would have been much better
other than that the quality is first ratetheres no way i cannot not like this bag  its leathery its tough it looks good and has a lot of space for a laptop and paperwork
and i never paid a dime for the  that i hadi get these for free back when i worked for ibm
we were moving out of a client site and moving our assets out of that client company
i have a stack of these things and was told to throw them away
i decided to keep them as they were near brand new some still had the product inspectors card in it
i cleaned up the leather and conditioned themi still have  left
i gave the rest awaywish i had known how much these sold fori got one of these before and they are really good
i was going to get one at staples but it was 
i paid  less for the same product that is a good deal to mei bought  of these for my work so we can lock down our laptops while at the client site
the product is good minus the fact you can only set the lock code once
i already had a coworker forget his code after  day so we had to scrap that lockcompares favorably with much more expensive cables
i actually dont use it for antitheft but as a safety wire to secure a ceiling mounted video projector but im sure it works as a theft prevention devise as well
fit the defcon connector and the price was rightif you follow the instructions that is why they are there this lock will work just fine i have never had it mysteriously change combination on me
there are only two problems with this little lock the first is it tends to seize up on occasion but it comes out after a few seconds not  minutes as mentioned by another reviewer
also this lock is fairly easy to change the combo so if you have a roommate that hates you or criminals that carry around screwdrivers you may be in a bit of troublethis is a mechanical lock it does not have a mind o its ownthis surge protector works well and provides lots of outlets more than i actually need for my equipment
it does the jobive had my spiii for about two years now during which the pricing has come down some and the package offerings have increased so this review may not match the exact contents amazon offers here
my unit came with a mb memory cartidge the serial port connection cord the usb programmer cord the v power cord for the cigarette lighter the quotstickyquot dash mount and a mapsource cd with codes to unlock one region the us and canada consisted of  regions iirc
i have since bought the beanbag dash mount and a mb card and purchased the quotunlock all regionsquot option for city navigatorprobably already included items for a new purchase in todays package
additionally i downloaded the quotbritishquot voice package from garmins website to replace the default quotamericanquot voicethe british ladys voice seems less harsh and less like a drill sergeant when giving directionsi love this unit because it makes navigation so easyisnt that the idea behind a gpsr
with the citynav map information loaded into the memory card and with mb it fits all of pa de md and dc and good chunks of wv oh ny and nj i am able to get turnbyturn directions to nearly any street address
if you ask it to route you to a given destination the unit actually tells you when a turn is coming up eg
quotin point two miles exit rightquot or quotin  feet turn leftquot if you are driving without a destination selected the unit will display the cross streets by name as you approach
you can zoom the map in for street detail or zoom out to see more of the countryside
if you have a destination selected the unit will zoom in automatically as you approach and zoom in even more for a detailed overview of approaching intersections as you near a turnif you are in an area for which you do not have the mapsource detail loaded the unit still has an internal base map that contains cities highways interstates and major bodies of water so it can still route you from city to city using the major roads
this makes driving long distances crosscountry feasible and you can load up the memory card with the areas you expect to spend most of your time in if you dont have enough memory for the entire routehowever in those areas for which you do have the map detail loaded you can get turnbyturn directions to an address or even select various destinations restaurants attractions banks shopping centers etc
listed by name andor distance
the unit also displays address and phone information for those destinations which is useful to call ahead and make reservations or check for vacancy if youre the spontaneous weekend tourist like i amthe color display is beautifulmajor routes are in red arterials in thick black minor streets in thin black rivers and lakes in blue parks and golf courses in green and the background will change at sunset or sunrise to yellow daylight or black night as appropriate the black streets will also switch to white at nightplease note that the map detail which includes streets and popular destinations is a feature of the map software not the unit itself
garmin seems to issue updated map software on an annual basis but you must pay for those updates
im still using citynav  although garmins website states that  is coming out this summer
the new  software will probably contain more business listings and reflect more recent road construction but im doing fine with  and dont see a need yet to pay for the upgrade
one reviewer complained about the lack of starbucks locations with his map and i expect garmin will be adding more and more types of businesses like that as time goes byenough babblingin summary here are some pros of this unito cheaper than most indash gps systemso portable so you can share the unit with your quotfleetquot or take it along in a rental car and youd best hide it or take it with you when parking so it doesnt get stoleno voice navigation so you can anticipate an upcoming turn without having to take your eyes off the roado color displayso much better than a gray scale mapo accurate and helpful when driving somewhere unfamiliaro automatic route recalculation if you miss a turn or have to detouro address and phone info for listed businessessites so you can call aheadand the cons ive experiencedo voice navigation could be somewhat improved for confusing intersectionsdo i take a right or sharp right at this fivewayo eats batteriesbut this unit is too bulky to walk around with so there is no reason it should ever be used without being plugged into your cigarette lightero awkward interfaceentering street names or address numbers is awkward with the rocker buttono loses signal in builtup areas with tall buildingsusually when you are downtown and really need directions the most unfortunately
however this is a problem with all gps receivers and due more to the nature of the gps system than the unit itselfall in all i love my spiii
it has all the features i really need
there are units out there that are newer have more features and may be easier to use but theyre also more expensive
as long as garmin keeps releasing updated map software compatible with the spiii this unit should serve my needs for many more yearsi bought my sp when i moved to the washington dc area and have to say it works great
i am never lost and it can find nearly everything
there are a few streets that have no numbers in arlington but otherwise it is pretty goodi have also used the sp when traveling to other areas
the one issue that i have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings
dc is not too bad but i have had bigger problems in places like nyc and toronto with the tall skyscrapers
if it is plotting a course for you you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds
to make things worse since there is such a grid in the cities it often takes a while to recalculate the course by which point you might be lost again
i find times when i need to pull off and wait for the gps to catch upi would highly recommend it if you travel a lot or are unfamiliar with an area just be careful if you are using it for large citiesim a computer consultant which means i use my palmpilot all the time
i had a palm iii but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket
i switched to the palm v series for its solid construction and rechargable battery
i searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the palm v hard case for this reason
it protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package
even with the case its still smaller than a palm iii
you have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to hotsync while still inside the case
i had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish
other than that its perfect
when i beat up the case too much ill just buy another one
my palm v still looks brand newill admit it i bought the case the metallic blue one too
just because it was sexy
it does a good job protecting my palm vx but the case doesnt seem sturdy
there also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the palm pilot gets pressed by the case this can be fixed by sliding the palm just a hair
overall this case rocks very glad i got it the metallic blue one is better though i get many compliments and good looks from it
buy iti did a previous review on this case which i liked and just wanted to clear up a misconception i read by another reviewerhe said the case doesnt offer that much protection because its just plastic with an aluminum finish
no
the case has real aluminum bonded to plastic because one of the occasional problems ive heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plasticaside from the occasional problem like that i found this to be quality case
although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it its worth it as it costs  to get the glass screen replaced by palm if it breaksthe palm hard case will keep your palm v protected without adding much to its size or weight
since i have the slim leather case and tried the rhinoskin case ill try to address some of the complaints others have  postedits only plastic  true but the outer metal shield adds quite  a bit of protectionthe spring is weak  part of the problem with using  the palm v hard case is installing your palm
if the rail is not centered  in the stylus holder either the front or the back of the case will not  close properly giving the impression that the springs are weak
true  they could be stronger but if you use your palm a lot you want it to open  easily
there is a line and a flat side on the rail to help you center it
it may take a few tries but keep at ityou have to remove your palm to  use the hotsync cradle  not true
just move the cradle to the edge of  the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge
just be careful you  dont knock it off the desk accidently
others have suggested placing a  book under the cradle
either works finelets face it
you bought  your palm v because of its size and you probably use it a lot
if so  this is your best option when it comes to cases
pretty good protection  easy to carry very slim and trim and easy to open and close
this case  also solves the problem of your palm turning itself on accidently a  problem with the leather cases and covers although the leather cases are  far more elegant and sumptuous
also because this case does not press on  the scroll button if you forget to turn off your palm and close the case  your palm will will turn itself off and not run down the batterythe  rhinoskin case does offer better protection however i did not feel it was  worth the money see my reviewi  purchased these rechargeable batteries for my daughter and myself
in the description it said twin pack aa batteries
so i ordered  packs and was billed for  pack shipping
but when i received the batteries it was a for pack
so if i only received  pack of  batteries instead of a  twin pack of batteries
why was i billed for  twin packs instead of just paying for   pack
very confusingi love these cases and have a few of them and will get more
no real complaints with them  sure reduced the amount of shelf space my dvds required and allows me to organize by genre
the sleeves are held in a ring binder so they can be pulled out and rearranged too so if you like to keep your dvds alphabetically you can pop a new cd into the stream without having to move every dvd like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that dont have removable pages
the material is strong adn well made
i very much like the leather look and feel of the case and they look sharp on the shelf
the zippers are strong and well formed the rivets are good the binder material is sturdy
these babies will last for a good long timemy only complaint with this case  and also the  dvd holder from caselogic  is that they really dont hold that many without bulging or overpacking
i figure the  dvd holder averages about  discs and the  holder gets  or   figure it this way  i have  of these holders
one holder when i bought it was missing  sleeves
but even though i started  sleeves less i should have it doesnt matter becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity i have about  sleeves left over that i cant use becuase the case holders arent big enough to hold as many dvds as they saythe other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know whats inside them
i thought of putting stickers onthem but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone and look ugly
so what i did and i recommend this to you is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case i sort mine by genre so mine say action or science fiction and each genre has its own color scheme etc
i did not put the movie names on the labels cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another eh
 and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle
this system works wonderfully and if you make really nice cards for them they look good toofor those two reasons i only give these  starsthose caveats aside these are wonderful  the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the dvd space for the disc itself they can even fit  dvds in them for those double dvd sets like star wars
they reduced my shelving needs by about  and for that its worth the cost and its way easier to carry  dvds in one package then  plastic dvd containersbuy these get your life in order and open some space in your houseits not foolproof but makes a good inexpensive deterrent
it makes it harder for anyone to just grab and go
i hooked this up to a mac mini and a monitorthis is exactly as i expected and as described
simple to install
sturdy module attachment via included super glue
cable is long enough for three items
i ran mine through a large eyescrew in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplacei suppose this item might deserve stars  but by necessity and function its not every attractive
not really kensingtons fault on that
but something ingenious would earn a th star used it in team gatheringmeeting areas to allow multiple users quick tabletop access to power
the round format is nice for a centralized locationthe current protection is good the design is clever and it feels much sturdier than my cheapo power strips
but why does it cost this is a great power strip
as many reviewers have pointed out the design allows you to use all the sockets as the sockets on standard rectangular power strips are often so close together that a plug for one device may block one or more sockets next to it
it is also the most stable power strip that i own as the round configuration keeps it solid on the floor exactly where you put it even on carpet  instead of leaning lifting and sliding around like many rectangular power strips another plus that other reviewers have noted
i also like the angled plug that plugs the power strip into the wall
this allows the cord to point on an angle toward the floor which helps conceal the cord and keep the power strip stable
the only reason i did not give it five stars is that the cord that connects the power strip to the wall socket is too long
i would have been happier with with an  to  inch cord as opposed to several foot length of this cord
having all this extra cord to some extent defeats the purpose of what is otherwise an unobtrusive and compact power stripive had my palm v since june st
to my brother wife amp parents who conspired for my birthday thank you
within two weeks i abandoned my franklin planner and regretted not having had a palm device  years ago
ok that was impossible  but it has dramatically changed my life for the  better and i cant imagine ever going without it
in the last several  months i have grown to be a very definite power user and the corporate  resource person for palmplatform pdas
our guys have tried several others  and are convinced that the palm platform is the best and most flexible
i  am very heavily into rdparty software evaluation amp some  accessories preparing recommendations for highefficiency palm  devicesoftware packages for companystaff issue
eventually i may put  together my own personal website and post some evaluations and  recommendations for softwareaccessories for palm usershaving said all  that heres an engineers myperspective on the palm v visors will be  great and palm iiixs are just fine but the palm v package size is  definitely worth a lot to me
forget the sexy appearance  its great but  the superior form factor rules
yes i would prefer that the vx cost is  about what the standard v discounts for now but since it will always fit  in my shirt pocket without changing my shirt wardrobe i always have it  with me in a place thats probably least susceptible to being damaged or  lost  and thats what its for
though i prefer to use the slim padded  com case i frequently slip the original leather flapcover on for small  shirt pockets amp thus can still carry a separate penpencilstylus  device
a big plus with those covers that ive never seen in a review the  soft grabby texture of the rubberlike spine flex keeps the palm from  sliding even if you do toetouches
tadah it doesnt fall out on the  floor
very big benefit since the cover isnt a padded case
likes  i like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home  desktop with the included ms outlook conduit autocharging in the docking  cradle a battery thats never gotten below a halfcharge nice screen  the size
i really like the unit overall  a truly great deviceany  problems
yep
i did have to get the updated email patch from the chapura  site to avoid some lockups when synching email
also i highly recommend  tealscript the customtailorable graffitti addon for its ability to  help you tune up your handwriting speedrecognition  and it visually  showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up  handwriting by adding a horizontal line com quickly replaced it under  warranty and its been finememory space
the average user probably  will have no problem for a couple of years  ive met people with iiis  that are using less than k a year after they get it theyve seen amp  use very few aftermarket programs
however ive got more programs in there  than will fit launcher datebook calc amp memo replacements travel  programs doc reader picture viewer several clocks a dozen utility and  security programs over a dozen hackmaster hacks and a few games
since  flashpro gave me the extra k memory room awesome i found i probably  had enough that i could otherwise get by fine without deleting rarelyused  fluff programs  except that i use it heavily for work amp software  evaluation
the memory room of the vx would be heaven  the perfect device  i think
itd be handy to carry a lot of maps but my current standard p  doesnt have the memory room without deleting say my picture viewer
oh  the screen
its great
yes folks it is a  greyscale display
probably  ill upgrade to the vx amp give my wife my standard v p unit she  thought it was no big deal when i got it but has fallen in love with the  capabilities and wants her own palm device
bottom line is that if youre a  minimalist the k of p memory is fine
but if you like to carry a  gerberleathermanswissarmy device like i do because a pocketknife  leaves you unprepared better get a vx or get the mb upgrade on your  pprice
when handspring comes out with something to compete with a vx  the price world will probably be great
yeh ps are expensive compared to  some of the lesser pdas  but compare the price to a palmtop computer and  they look like a great deal especially considering the impact on your  lifestylecan i mention my essential addon programs list
tough area  but currently i wouldnt give up these  listed in order of descending  requirement undupe get it

indepth info
oreillys palmpilot the  ultimate guide is a fantastic reference for all palm ownerswhen i hear pda i would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the palm v but has a lot more packed in it
palm v is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technologys first stepbut after using it for about a year now i am being selfish
i want more memory i want color i want sound and i want a floating connection to the rest of the world
so my advice  when you buy a pda go for something with at least color and more memory for the sake of technologys next step
you are going to run out of the palm vs mb if you are like me and like to download all those available applications
palm vx has mb memory which should be enough for the time being but i want more sorry 
i am looking at the pda to be the materialisation of isaac asimovs vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number
so if you want to talk to your sister just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower 
our privacy is going to be under fire but it is going to be fun all the same
asimov said that by  this will be a reality
and the world is fast getting there
palm v is only an initial step 
my advice  go for the next stepi cant believe this can still be reviewed
i dont have much to say but i have a few old contacts still on my ten year old palm that i still havent transferred over
i know
the point is that my palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly
i dont think i have even charged it in a few years
this thing is amazing in its longevitythis was one of palms real groundbreaking handhelds with its sleek case and low weight
still a great handheld but only has  mb of memory and lacks the sd slot that the new palms are being manufactured with
if you just need a calendar and address book this will do it but the m will do just about the same with albeit a much smaller screen
the backlight on the palm v is woeful like the backlights on all palms but is not needed too ofteni was forced to buy the aluminum case for my pv because the power would consistently come on while it was in my pocketif you intend to carry this around as a pocket device youll be stuck with investing in a case  bewarealthough the palm v is more appealing than the iii its essentially the same technology
ive had one wear out and die another just fail and quotrebootquot itself alot another fail from getting a little wet
i  love these things but for me the extra  for the v translates into   per year vs  per year assuming it lasts two yearsummm the paper is slightly thicker than regular paper
it never jammed my printer
it has perforated lines for folding but it didnt work out like that for my printer
maybe i aint doing something right but to gets the job done so whateverthe template prints a little off and these are pretty much just pieces of cardstock paper but for a cheap insert these are good
they tear off of the sheet easily and fit perfectly in jewel casesvery easy to use and they fit very well
good cheap labels that work very well with my printer
thanksthese labels are great for cds and dvds
the labels have perforations in the paper to give excellent neatness that gives your projects a professional look
great for thin and thick media holderssoftware that you download is a little tricky but once you get used to it it works as it says
paper isnt the heaviest of card stock but thats ok  serves its purpose
i would buy againi used these to make covers for slim lined cd jewel cases
the photo and music list lined up perfectly without adjustment because i used memorex jewel cases
the only issue i had was with the design software
i never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers
all the icons and instructions were clear but the did not work
i could see the list download from the cd in the drive and it showed up in the software library but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover
ended up typing it in manually
also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo
it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo
i could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground
so i reversed the process placing the photo first and then the text on topthe paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case however i wish it had a gloss to it
the photo came flat and a bit muted even after changing out all the ink in the printerused this for a give away music cd for a party
it was fine for what i was doing however i would not use it on a professional work projecti took this hub out of the box plugged it in connected it to our internal network and my two pcs about two months ago and it has worked  flawlessly ever since
all without reading the manual
this hub is  perfect for me because i occasionally attach a legacy mbps device and  dont need more than three ports other than to link to our existing  networkone warning  if you have other netgear hubs and equipment  keep the power supplies separate
i had a singlespeed mbps hub and got  the power supplies mixed up
the unit looked like it was working but  actually wasnt
the power supplies look similar the plugs are the same  but i think the current andor voltages are differentother than that  this is a great product
as i said earlier it just works
when you  factor in price you cant misswhile i have never really found huge differences in hubs based on the name brand i have generally been very happy with this netgear hub and my new netgear router
it is built very solid which is not true of all hubs and seems to stand up well to some heavy use
ill sometimes have to take it into work and i move it around frequently when i rearrange my officeso it gets more mileage than most hubs
the one weakness ive found with netgear is the tech support
their web site is not the most userfriendly site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything
but it is all there and you can get pdf copies of the manuals and such so that is helpful
the one time ive had to contact netgear phone support related to a wireless network card it was not impressive at all
but for this hub you should have no need for tech support and it is an excellent hubour office used to use a handful of the en port hubs and some of the en the port version of the same productas  mbps hubs go the ens are really nicethe quality of netgear equipment has always impressed me  nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic  status indicators built into the jacks so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active  rightangled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally  with an easytoaccess switch port  toggles between station mode and uplink mode
unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink  screwmount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall underside of a counter etcif you want to set up a network without spending much these hubs work well
however i suggest you buy a  mbps hub insteadheres whypractically all new networkable devices today support  mbps fastethernet as well as  mbps ethernet
the en hub and other  mbps hubs will limit you to the slower speedas  mbps hubs are readily available today and are quite affordable i think your money is better spent on the faster hubis there a noticeable difference between  mbps and  mbps
it depends on your usage but if you regularly work with files larger than about  kbytes or larger youll notice a tangible difference
for truly large files like graphicsmovies or when installing an application via a network drive a  second transfer at  mbps will take well over a minute at  mbpsif the netgear  hub ds is a bit too pricey for you you might consider the linksys efahw  hub
though not as quotnicequot as netgear equipment the linksys  hub is only a few dollars more than this netgear  mbps huba great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with  computers or have a local network of  computers
either way the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised
netgear is known for making quality ethernet products and this is just another one of themi have bought two of these for home and office use
they work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality
i was running at least windows  on all computers i hooked up to the ethernet hub
windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharingafter you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing
you can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of filessetup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already
even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by stepthis sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and i find it adequate for carrying my camera aroundthis case is the perfect size for the d and accessories case is approx quot tall x quot wide x quot deep
the main pouch is well padded and made of soft material
the bottom is reinforced to resist wear
inside the front zippered pocket there is a mesh pocket for memory cards as well as an divided elastic band meant for  aa batteries
inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch which runs the entire legnth of the flap approx
quotxquot for extra accessoriesthe only thing i dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak and seems to come open without much force
i would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closedother than that this is a fantastic case and i recommend iti bought this bag to use with my olympus c
based on what other reviewers wrote i expected the bag the bag to be more compact than it is i could fit two of my cameras in there
construction and compartments are excellent and its a great bag if you have a few accessories to carryreceived this bag to go along with my olympus c
its quite a nice bag relatively compact and easily fits my c with plenty of protection offereed by the walls of the case and padded divider
there is plenty of room left for cables a flash or even another camera if youve got one
a mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offers a handy place to store my sm cards
on the other side another component offers  elastic loops for batteries  and  mesh pouches  zippered for storing more batteries or whatever else you might have
i can easily store  sets of  aa batteries in here with plenty of room for more sm cards
and to top it all off a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff nothing too thick though
theres an adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over your shoulder plus handles on the top and side so there are plenty of ways to grab onto the bag
the only think i dont like about this bag is that mine doesnt seem to want to stand up
it always ends up rolling over onto its back
this however is a pretty minor thingthe case logic dc digital camera and accessory bag is great for olympus c c c and the hp c xi and  a couple of other hp and olympus models
however it is not big enough to room the sony mavicas
so dont bother getting this for thosei do have a problem with this bag and that is that it seems like the accessories on there are really stuffed onces your camera is placed inside it
because the camera comes with the usb cable and the tv connection cable and its hard to  pack all of them in here with the camera without stuffing them intheres place for a battery recharger in there and a set of batteries along with the compact flash cards
overall this case is pretty decent although youve got to be careful not to let the case swing about from your arm and hit a wall or something
there are other websites selling this a little cheaperhad mine since december  but noticed that the battery failed after about  years like the other poster wrote apc didnt list a replacement at first but now they do and i finally got around to replacing it
battery type is rbc for those wonderingsolid unit having a telephone lineout and usb controller is a plusi have had three of these units for the past  years one for my pc one for the wifes and one for the tivo  cable box
we have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month  usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours
anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running
however they dont last too long on battery power
just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things downthe batteries wore out after about  years so i replaced them using batteries from a web vendor
now the first battery of this second round has failed so im buying another round of three batterieshopefully these units will last many more yearsthis is a basic sound card
nothing fancy
the thing that seperates it from the rest is that creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all windows the linuxbsd world probably supports this thing i havent checked
this is as close to plug and play as you can getthat guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his irqs not to mention dump windows me which microsoft doesnt even stand bylove the binoculars just like everyone else
only complaint is the flimsy attachments
the neck strap is impossible to attach and is obviously a piece of junk anyway so dont bother
i find it annoying that the lens covers arent connected in some way
they pop off very easily
just seems to me like something that could easily be prevented with better design
all things considered these are really minor complaints
the purpose is to get great binoculars for a great price and that i did
i would still highly recommend themwhen youre getting a pair of x binoculars at this pricepoint it would probably be harsh of me to criticize them too hard so long as i can see through them effectively theyre heavy  but thats what i expected so no complaints therethe strap that comes with these is made of nasty thick plastic  a kind of strap that i havent seen since i got a cheap slr in the early s
completely pointless unusable in my opinion and the first thing i would advise is to go buy the strapsupport system of your choice and dont relay on the nasty accessory that comes withthe binoculars come with lens caps on
i havent figure out if they intend you to use them all the time to protect the lenses or if theyre just for show in the box
the large caps are fine but the small ones do not stay attached so dont rely on them to protectin use the quick focus mechanism is actually very effective but definitely requires two hands to operate as its a little stiff and as a lever you have to be able to press down on either side
i guess few people would be operating something this heavy with one hand but it does mean that both hands are under tension as you have to have fingers on the  focus mechanismoptically these are absolutely built to the price
definite chromatic aberration here giving a nice blueyellow fringe especially at longer distances
but for the price i kind of expected that
diopter correction works welloverall a great product for the price
i would possibly recommend looking at spending a little more to get some better optics but really for this money its a great way to get this much magnificationgot these so i could use them for hunting and other spotting little bulky but good distance
comes with everything you needi bought this item to go nature viewing and must say that it really is a great binocular for the price
the items viewed have a really nice dimensional look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself
the focus for this model  x  wide angle is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it very convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers
it gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades
the binoculars do shake a little bc of the power of the magnification
and it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time bc of its weight
it weighs about as much as one of micheners hardback novelshere is where it can get interesting
the binoculars come with a pleather carrying case a really cheap neck strap that looks like a plastic shoelace and a cheap cleaning cloth that is way too abrasive to be used everyday
i suggest replacing both the neck strap and cleaning cloth as soon as you can
the soft microfiber cloths they sell in eyeglass stores works great
plus pick up some of the eyeglass cleaner spray directly onto cloth not lens as it really gets the lens clean and protects any coating on the glasstripod use  highly recommended to get a steady picture
you can get a regular camera tripod for around  dollars
yes this binocular comes with a tripod adapter
no its not very easy to find
ltggt  the instruction booklet is virtually useless but i found out through the website that the adaptor is located behind the front cap between the barrels
just screw the cap off and viola there is your threaded coupler
you will still need to get a binocular adaptor to connect the binoculars to the tripod but ive found that they arent too expensive  around  dollars for the generic models
i gave this item  stars bc of the poorly written instruction manual and cheap accessories
hope some of this info helps
cant wait to see the stars tonightthis modem is the most economical one that i have ever purchased
under windows  it ran at k
but in my case i had to enable the pci slot through the bios
my pci slots were disabled by default by the phoenix  bios
i have a dec xl
i tried to install it under windows nt sp  but to no avail
even though service was excellent the modem exhibited no  response after installation
i was advised to reinstall nt and the  service pack but my system crashed
with a us robotics internal faxmodem  i got k in windows  the difference is not significant but the price  was
in general i highly recommend this economical and fast modem under  windows like other people have said before me this modem wont break through the kbs barrier
my external xircom serial port modem could connect at  kbs on the same line
the effective difference between  kbs and  kbs  is negligible though so who caresthe drivers for this modem loaded  easily the first time and when i cleaninstalled win they  automatially reinstalled no questions askedon a side note this modem  supports the rare  volt standard
some highend workstations and  servers use the  volt standard but everyone else uses the  volt  standard so this doesnt matter for most people
 volts is an  quotemergingquot standard which will probably never catch on
most pci  modems only fit into  volt pci slots
a  volt pci card slot has  different gooves so that you cant mistakenly put a  volt card into it
the supramax is compatable with both
silicon graphics pointed me towards  the supramax after i struck out with another modemclosing comments  this modem has served me well but now it collects dust inside my computer  thanks to my cable modem
its still nice to know that its there for me  and i use it occasionally to test how long my sites take to load for the  notyetbroadbanded peoplei own a se and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same
i was worried about things that i had read stating that the case was shoddy the volume level was insufficient  and the memory didnt hold enough
i just wanted to say that all of this  is not true
it seems really solid to me not that id ever drop the thing  or be rough with it but it does just fine while jogging or riding a  bikeas for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening  to songs encoded at a low base level because i listen to mine on level  of   and its fine for most songs unless im in a really noisy  environmentlastly i listen to all of my songs at k
and i can fit an  acceptable amount of music on my megsno it isnt as much as a cd but  with  meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to  get me through all but the longest of plane flights
with the portability  of the transfer cable and software i can just burn all of my mps to a cd  or  throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever i  happen to bemuch more efficient than lugging around all of my cdr mixes  and other cds
true the parallel transfer is much slower than the usb that  the  offers but do i really want to use usb when places that i travel  might not offer usb support
also the backlight of the new s are  supposed to drain the battery power and i dont find the lack of a  backlight to be as big of a problem as i thought it would be however
i  would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to  use and extends the headphones cord length by a good  feet
see yai got my rio pmp  from my employer as a gift
it was my first exposure to mp as up to that point i had been dismissing it as a fad
having the device and about  cds i figured why not give it a shotthe installation of the software went smooth
i found an update and installed that as well with no problems
then i started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable
i was running on windows nt which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer but with some caveats
i would start ripping and the software would crash
i would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash
i would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didnt actually make it
bottom line  the connectivity for this device was patheticbut speaking for the device itself  i loved it
the music played cleanly without interruption regardless of how much i shook the device
the buttons on the front are well placed well labeled and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access but you dont have to worry about them protruding
it has all the features you might want including random and repeat
the display lets me know how much memory i have what track number is playing and the time of the song
there are also various other indicators that are helpfull battery etc
the memory on this device is small  mb
and the manufacturer says it will only support up to mb total with an expansion card
that expansion card can hold its own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory
however vendor chose the odd memory type of v for the external memory versus typical compactflashtheres a convenient quotlockquot switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering
this can be good in two ways it wont get turned on accidentally and burn battery and you wont accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening
the belt clip is handy and detachable and the battery life one aa is quite respectablein all i really love my rio pmp   its perfect for a trip to the gym a jog around the neighborhood or even for a short plane flight
if all you need is an hour  mins on internal memory alone at a  sample rate to pass the time then you really dont need to spend more  this is the perfect devicei recently upgraded my stock hewlett packard pavillion  speakers to the yamaha ystmsw watt piece subwoofersatellite computer speakers
first and foremost let me tell you one thing wow and i really mean wow what a great set of computer speakersunderstand you dont get full blown surround sound with these speakers  few pc applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway
but unlike the higher end  and  speakers on the market today these speakers will out of the box work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards
and this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable costmy only complaint and it is an exeedingly small one is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker volume and onoff and the sub woofer base volume  it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit ie
on a satellite speaker
but i can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the pricenetnet awesome i would even say unsurpassed sound quality to cost ratio extremely easy setup took me less than  minutes  and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my pc room wished the connecting wires were longer the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within  feet of the subwoofer needs some industrial design tweaks ie
audio controls should all be in one place rich base sweet highends and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers must have for any audiophile who is on a budgetnice headphones
no noise escapes the headphones to disturb others
got them for my daughters keyboard
she says the only negative is that they dont have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play  when others are trying to sleep or whateverthese headphones have some nice features
they are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head
they are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for nonlightweight headphones
they also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach
the only issue i have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones i have used that cost about the same
if you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around its tough to beat thesethey are not exactly noise cancelling as i read in some of the reviews
you can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if its loud
it does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well
for the price id say its worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is onthis headset is inexpensive so dont expect a product you will have for years to come
however it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortablei  chose this item to go with my synthesizer
it fits perfect and i can hear very clearly
it appears to provide a surround soundthe sound is good with these headphones and i use them to watch movies and you tube
my only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and i have to take them off
it would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size but for width
it would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top
otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky which was why i bought them in the first placei bought this for my son to practice piano with
he doesnt like his current headphone
its the kind that covers the ears completely and his ears turn red and itchy from it
this one doesnt cover the ears completely but the foam part is still much bigger than your average headphone
so i took off the piano connector part and snap it onto the plug a cheap headphone with small foam area and my son likes that way the best
i try to give the headphone to a different son but he doesnt like the feel either
prefers the cheap ones he already hasthe piano connector part snaps onto the regular headphone part tightly plus it has an area you can grab onto so that you can pull everything out of the keyboard easily so that the piano part isnt stuck in the keyboard when you remove the headphoneso now im using in bed to watch movies on my computer while not disturbing my husband
it feels fine to me but i have hair covering my ears
the sound is good
and it covers the sound pretty good
when i take off the headphone i dont hear much from itfor the price i think this is worth itthese speakers stunned me
when my tiny quotcame with the pcquot speakers died i looked into getting some similar little speakers but then realized that i could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker setfirst let me say that the subwoofer boooms
the bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system
really remarkable
i used this system in my dorm room at columbia university this summer and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching dvds and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine
with the massive boooom of the system it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiasticmy only complaint in fact is that boom
the subwoofer doesnt have an independent volume control so if i turn up the volume on the little speakers the subwoofer follows right along thunderously loud
a separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfectthis speakers are great sounding little things for the computer
if you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start
i have two sets of them and have had no problems with them and yes they are loudcertainly not the best speakers you could ever have for your computer the acs nevertheless fills an important niche in the market
if youre looking for subwoofered sound on the cheap this is probably your best bet
theyre competent performers without taking price into consideration
look at how much they cost and youll think there arent better speakers made on the planet
they have the potential to work as do most speakers on both macintosh and windows machinesinterestingly they also have a secondary use
because they dont need a computer to work at all they can be plugged directly into any stereo system that has the ability to output its sound that is one which has an audio out jack
they can thus give resonant stereo soundeven to lowly portables
youll think twice about whether you really need to upgrade to a whole new system after hearing these speakers
before buying for this purpose however id recommend you go to alteclansingcom and grab the manual for this product just to make sure that its compatible with your stereo
inasmuch as there are drawbacks to the speakers they are ones you would expect from a product so inexpensive
as another reviewer has rightly pointed out theres no volume control on the woofer
theres also no bass treble or speakerindependent volume control
and the speakers are rated at only  watts with a relatively indelicate frequency responsebut big dealif like most people youve got your computer jammed into a corner in a busy room you dont have the soundspace to set up a truly extraordinary auditory experience
if youve got a lot of people living with you anything more than  watts is discourteous anyway
unless you have a room that you can dedicate to the computer and thats relatively isolated from others its extremely unlikely you would actually be able to use more than this system offersif this is your first headset or you dont plan to have heavyuse this is as good as it gets
the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable
however if you are going to spend time with this the plantronics m by far worth the additional expense
much more invisible from the stand point of the user you completely forget its on your head and the listener on the other end
i have them both and switch to the plantronics unit when i know it is going to be a long call or i going to be moving aboutthis lightweight headset does the job and the price is right
its held up well for  months of daily use
the fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to but its nice that it is so lightnot many things you can buy for  anymore but this is definitely worth the small investmentthe headset is comfortable has a good microphoneearpiece and is almost unnoticeable after a few minutes of use
make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isnt too heavy to carry around
the only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button so its best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself
i use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with bothi am a gamer and i dont use headsets i use headphones with a seperate mic
i saw someone on headfiorg who bought one of these and used industrial strength velcro to attach one of these to their ads so i decided to try it with my akgs
it works pretty well but the mic is real quiet right out of the box but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to db it is super clear and crisp
if you put the mic boost up to db you can hear large amounts of feedback buzzinghumming noise but that it not too big of a problem because it works fine with a db boost
i would recommend this to any gamer but if you can spend a little more money go for the ant lion mod mic vedit  i recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable and has a volume control and mute button and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback buzzinghumming noisethis is one great trackball
the product i bought is actually the cordless version of the fx trackball but its basically the same as this one except for the cordlesswireless feature
the ergonomics are a little different also but its basically the same trackball deviceyou cant beat the smoothness of this trackball
ive seen lots of them over the years but none ever impressed me enough to buy one until now
now that ive tried one im a convert
the action is extremely smooth once you adapt a little to the finger movements to move the ball
also getting used to the placement of the four different buttons takes a little time
but once this is accomplished the ability to move smoothly and quickly around your computer screen is vastly improved over a typical mousethe buttons are all configurable as to function but ive found sticking with the default settings during the software setup is the best way to go
there is one thing i am trying to see how it works out
i reconfigured button  as the delete key
this is sort of convenient because it allows you to browse and delete files just with the  trackball instead of having to use the other hand to hit the delete key on the keyboard after highlighting a file with the trackball
pretty convenient for those occasional cleanup tasks on your hard diskanother thing i have found useful is to use medium instead of low acceleration which allows you to shoot all the way across the screen by moving the trackball maybe an inch and a half or so but then to drop the overall sensitivity down a bit
the default setting for trackball sensitivity is right in the middle of the range on the slider adjustment bar
i drop it down one more tack on the slider bar
this assists in hitting all those small buttons when using high resolution on your monitor
the medium acceleration gets you there faster but then you have more control once youre there to zero in on the button
try it and see if you like this better than the default settings
you will find these settings by opening up the trackball program menu clicking on quotmouse propertiesquot and then on the quotmotionquot tabone last thing i do to customize the operation of the trackball is you can check a box that causes the cursor to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box
i find this useful alsoi noted a very interesting new feature
one of the buttons when clicked pops up the quotwebwheelquot this is a wheel with  different pieshaped pieces which are configurable as web addresses or for other webrelated functions such as go back reload go to favoritesbookmarks and so on
when you hit this button the wheel comes up and you basically have a second menu to choose selection from
pretty cooli should mention the software install is a little nonintuitive
the instructions say to disconnect your mouse and plug in the new trackball with the power off
however when you boot the machine windows  sees the now missing mouse and wants to autodetect your hardware again and recreate the entire driver database
not knowing what would happen i just cancelled out of this screen and let the computer boot up normally but without any mouse function
i then loaded the software using the tab key to navigate around to configure everything which wasnt too hard and after you are finished it asks do you want to reboot and after that the trackball works normallyalthough not cheap all in all a fine product that is worth the moneyi like this headset
i have four of them
i find i use ptt most of the time to avoid cut off first syllables etc
when i absolutely have to be handsfree though the vox will work too
decent understandable audio unlike some ive usedworks wellonly issue i have is it appears to automatically activate vox mode
and id rather use pttother note might be that compared to the old spirit gt headset its not a comfortable
but its good enoughthis is very good headset sound quality is good
the headband is adjustable and very confortable
i gave it  stars instead of  because it doesnt do vox with my frs because the fr doesnt have vox capability
price is reasonable too
what more can i say about a simple headsetthis mic works well but its a bit awkward
i got it because the webcam i was using didnt have a builtin microphone for my yahoo messenger and skype live chats
it was crisp and clear sounding but ive since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so muchgood quality good audio and made by motorola
was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleekerthis product does exactly what its supposed to do
i dont understand people who expected this product to support vox
it does not say anything about vox in product description
i personally dont like vox because i dont want my children to hear what im saying when i fall down while skiing anyway the product is ok the only problem for me is a very short wire thats why i gave it  starsi have only one complaint about this earbudmic unit  the cord is too short
otherwise the sound quality is good and the builtin mic with ptt works fine
a mm extension cord from radio shack meant for phone headsets  alleviates the cord problem however
the earbud cushion is comfortable
to be discreet this is an excellent accessory for your motorola frs radioif the cord was  foot longer  stars
i dont get it
is someone saving  cents for every one of these
or  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer
would have been great if it came with a removable ear clipwire but not really complaining about that
maybe a future feature
then again if they cant make the cord  foot longer i wouldnt expect any other luxuries
functionally seems finei havent really tried this yet it hangs in my wah and whacks me in the head while im drivingi have to rig up some cord restraints that will allow me to still use the thingi think it will help me communicate when i get the instalation worked outthese motorola mics worked great for our gmrs radios
our crew prefers using these in the attics instead of pulling the walkies out of their pocket or belt clipsspeaker when you plug in the microphone the sound you hear come out of the mic when you press the transmit button on the mic or the radio the microphone acts like a microphone sound quality is nice volume is adjustable by volume control on radiocord my main gripe is the cord the coiled cord on the new mics are tight from waist to shoulder by stretching the coil out this problem goes away
almost wish that the cord came prestretched so the new cords werent so tightclip the clip clips at the top of the mic it would have been better if the clip swiveled on the back of the mic as everyone doesnt like to clip the mic on their shoulder lapel or collar
i prefer the mic in front of me and being able to swivel the clip would have been a major plusquality the mics are high quality and work well
out of the  i ordered i only had to return  due to failure right out of the packageoverall great mics at a descent price
at first the cord will be annoying but with time it should stretch and work better on adults
may look a little funny though if all your kids had these mics on their shoulders
people may give you strange looksmotorola  remote speaker mic works well with my scanner with the speaker mic my radio sounds loud and clearthe mic works well and has a built in speaker so you can have the audio feed close at handsadly the cord is so taught and tightly wound there is no possible way to have the radio at waist level and the mic at shoulder level
after months of trying to stretch the cord it remains as short and tight as the day i received it
when it was attached at shoulder level the radio often jumped off of my belt and survives only because the cable did not detach and the radio did not ever strike the ground
i have been relegated to attaching the mic to my tie at about sternum level which works but requires a higher audio level output than if it were on my shoulder near my eari give it four stars because it does what it says it will do keeps me from having to constantly remove and replace my radio and also because after my repeated stretching attempts the cord has not shorted out no small feati truly wish it were more flexible or longer but i guess it does the jobused for a long road trip with  cars
the cord lenth isnt horrible it was ok for my use but i agree it could be longer
overall for the  bucks i paid for a used one was worth iti bought this product for the handhelds i bought a couple of weeks prior
i used this for my job because i was not always in the cafe and if something was needed from the storerooms or there was a customer complaintproblem
they worked great and did as i expected toive been using for  weeks now for work communications with only one problem
the coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever i clip it
either make cord  inches longer or she more flexible cordnice having a speaker mic
setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap
too bad motorola can not reduce its weight
when hiking every ounce countsmy idiot producer lost my recorder so did not get to use more than one of thesei received these in perfect condition
they are used with a minicassette recorder
i have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder so i dont know if i have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor qualitythe only reason i didnt give this  starts is because im having a problem finding a place to hang it
not a product problem its an issue with me and my vehicle i dont want to block vents by attaching this to the passenger area in front
also note mine came with a webbed adjustable strap  not the string setup in the picturethis is a small and cute bag a book sizeif you have a long drive trip you may need a bigger one except dump it oftenif you have kids on the trip you need a bigger onei like this trash bag it fits the bill for me pretty well
just about the right size bag im not sure i would want it any biggeri think it would get in your passengers way as they get in and out
i really like the elastic closure on the top if it does get bumped nothing spills out
its also really easy to empty with the velcro along the bottom
i use this in my work car and i am going to purchase another for my personal carthis bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car
before i got it i would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor
this handles that pretty well
couple cons though it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly make sure to check out the dimensions and it is not always easy to empty out
the velcro does hold the bottom closed very well just if it is really full you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it
this is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor and i am very happy with the purchaseive been collecting radios for a couple of years now and own over  at last count
they range from old tubetype am table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest
let me tell you what i think about the grundig ybpestrong points  solidfeeling quality
it doesnt feel cheap when you pick it up  good sensitivity across all bands  nice full sound from the internal speaker  accessory package includes a good quality soft case ac adaptor budtype earphones and  compact sw antenna  the ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a hardtotune stationnotsostrong points  only  presets
i dont need  but it would be nice to be able to separate them into folders for am fm sw  battery life is acceptable but definitely not exceptional
i usually plug in the ac adaptor because of this  i wish it had a rotary tuning and tone basstreble knobs
why
i just like them  the backlight is very weak  a poor choice of ledsi know a lot of people find ssb reception to be important but i rarely use it
as often as not i like to just tune around the sw bands at night and see what i can find
sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the usim a radio fan not a radio geek
i just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good
if youre like me ill bet youll like this radio
if youre a geek you may have more bones to pick with it but on that i really cannot commentthe good stuffbfo for ssbwill tune in  khz stepsvery very good sound through phones if you have good onesvery good sound with built in speakerfm stereo through phonesvery good fmgood ammwgood sw with whip anthandy reel antvery good owners manual with frequency guide for ameteuraironauticaland maritimenice casebuilt very well with good quality feel to itthings that bug mebut not too muchbass and treble would be nicebut if not cant we at least have a tone knob
not even the famed sony  has one
why not
the hilow switch is better than nothingand does an ok jobno rf gain controltwo way dxlocal switch onlyno tune knob just up and down buttonsso its a bit of a pain to band scanpush push push push push push pushcan tune in  khz stepsbfo only
no usblsbtunes in  khz steps with bfo fine tune knobstill ok for ssb just could be betterno sync detectorhaywhat do ya want for that price cheezy earbud phones
then again did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything
not mespend a little and get some koss portapro phonesyou will never go back to cheap ones againdial light only stays on for  secdont let all of this talk you out of one thoughwhat it does it does wellall in all a fine little radio esp
for the 
quite good sound with the speakerand very very good through phonesgood mwam dx not a  or rf butstill a lot better than you might thinkgood with just the whip ant
for swvery good fmi think its by far the best radio you can get for the moneygrab one while you can still get a new onei have many shortwave radios around the house and use them primarily for easy access to many regular am and fm stations
i use a sony swg black version as a clock radio because it only has  presets per band
its how you switch the stations thats important and the ybpe requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stationsif the memory preset is two digits why do you have to press enter
the sony takes one keystroke granted though the new silvercolored sony doesnt do this either
surely if youre looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful but the frequencies change so much i always use the wrth and ptwbr books and never use the presetsthe sound is much much better than the sony
it has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and musicaside from choosing memory presets this radio would be more perfect if it had synchronous detection where the carrier is discarded and a sideband is used for better audio
the sony has this and it completely removes interference form rfi sources like computers and fluorescent lampsbandscanning is okay if you dont mind the muting every time the frequency changes some people call this chuffing
the automatic seek stops on the noisiest frequency not just one with a carrierthe radio is made in china and has been rebranded as eton recently
i have one of the preeton chinesemade models but i wonder how much better the old taiwanese version was
edit after about four years of daily use the sound has finally deteriorated
i notice that after about two hours operation something overheats and the sound becomes muddy and distortedi have had this radio for  years
it has worked well and has good sound quality as well as very decent shortwave performance for the pricepros great value for price and i recommend the purchase if you want a good shortwave radio with stereo fm capability
the cons which follow would not prevent me from making this purchase againcons the packaging is injection molding plastic fitfinish and design is poor and much like a product that costs 
it has not failed but just leaves a bad taste compared with japanese competition
what is worse is the legend for the features that one would use in low light conditions such as alarm is medium blue against black small letters
they cant be read easily in normal light much less normal household lighting
the logic is typically germanlike my  vwsthey seem to do things in a way that is different from anyone else and thus it is not intuitive without reading the manualagain if it is a seldom used feature
also a tone control instead of a switch would have been nice as well a ability to charge batteries while plugged inive had the opportunity to compare the grundig ybpe to several premium radios the tivoli pal the sony icf sw the grundig s the sangean  and the kaito  how does it rank
it ties for second with the aforementioned radios for fm
first place goes to the kaito  for am it takes a tie for last place with the sangean  even the reception strength meter shows a weak signal for  am a major los angeles station
in contrast my kaito s meter shows full strength in its signal
and you can hear a huge difference too
the yb  does have a good speaker clear and adequate for a radio its size but its not exceptional
id give the nod to the kaito  since the kaito  is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the yb i say its a no brainer get the kaito this is one of the best portable radios out thereit has great shortwave reception
the fm
and am both have great sensitivity and selectivity the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones
the only reason i dont give this radio  stars is because of the telescoping antenna
ive been through  radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use
other than that this would be a perfect radiobriefly the fm and am reception are very good for the grundig yb pe radio
sw is decent and ssb is fair at best
the controls and display for the grundig are good too ergonomically the choices made by grundig were sound and better than much of the competition
which is to say the buttons and controls are easy to master in comparison to similar kaito and sony models
the sony icfswgr is a better unit i have to say but the audio on the grundig is much preferable to the sony
overall i would take the sony but the grundig is a good portable radio and i would not be disappointed if i were on a desert island with just a grundig yacht boy pe as company
well donethis was my first and only digital camera that i purchased as a display item will i was working at compusa
if i remember correctly at the time this camera was over  but i got it for i have no idea how old this camera was when i bought it but despite that it lasted an additional   years before it stopped working the battery connections went bad
i took it apart to see if i could fix it but to no availthe  megapixels was more than sufficent for me it took crystal clear pictures everytime
i really enjoyed the lcd screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture
it also had a usb slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your pc
my only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneousthis camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials
this camera had been dropped a few times but it still functioned without any problems
i have taken thousands of pictures on this camera not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before i came to own it and i have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this cameraafter my dc finally met its demise i was dissapointed to find that kodak no longer made cameras like this instead they make these plastic cheap looking cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the dc series
i purchased a dx model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because i was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera
to this day the dc has been my only digital camera and i havent had one since
i will have to turn to ebay to get something from the dc series because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used toi really like mine
it takes good pictures
it was easy to get started with it
do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag
i highly recommend the usb disk reader makes things a lot easier
with that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your tv
note that the kodak  is offered here it is probably more value
but you will have to buy accessories so it will become a bit more after its all done
i cant say too much about how the pics print because i have been using it exclusively for internet images
i am having fun with mineworksi like belkin products and need a patch cable to run from my wireless modem to my laptop it fits just right and snaps in tighti needed a cable shorter than  feet
the  cable i had was too short
the snagless feature is  really useful since i have a tangled nest of cables under the desk  disconnecting and reconnecting will not be a problemneeded a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch
wanted a reliable brand name belkin cord with quality connectors
this one looks well built
only shortcoming is that it is cat e  speed vs cat   speed
didnt see a  foot one in cat  but the price for the cat e was very fairi know its a silly thing to say about a cable but i love the color of it
its difficult to get to the release latch to unplug the cable when its hooked into the back of a  but otherwise its just what i was looking for
it works fine for system link as long as your monitors are close enough togetheri mostly use this in hotel rooms and its been nice having the short cable
its flexible and the ends make a nice connection
i think with normal use this cable will last me a long timeit is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where
i recently rewired my office and have now colorcoded everything and it is making things much easier
its nice to know the external network drive is purple and the networked printer is yellow etcits hard to gush about a cable but this was the right amount of cable for a short run and it worked fine and the price was good
you have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping workwhats blue  long and filled with bits of wire yeah stupid joke but this thing works as advertisedyepthe product was what i expected and the price was the main reason i made the purchase
i have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on woodi needed short cables to connect my home theater devices to a single ethernet cable by way of a ethernet switchrouter
these cables fit the bill nicely and the quality is good
local stores charge much more money for  cables which would be an expensivecable eyesorei bought this for my onkyo receiver which required a direct connect internet connection to receive the dozen or so channels available xm pandora rhapsody etc
it is of good construction and looking color and adds some fun to my otherwise mundane system layout
live it up and try come of the colors availablesince using daily ive not had a problem at all
arrived on time well packaged and as i ordered
solid good productwell not alot to say on this
i bought this to connect my roku box to my router since they are only about  feet apartits thin and not the best quality but it works great
snagless means that the ends are protected from being snapped offwhile feeding the cord through holes or openings in your desk or entertainment center
it worksand well thats what matters most
so my opinion to run an ethernet cord to a short distance you cant get a better valueit worked for me but then i pulled it out of a box of other cables
the plastic tip broke off because it caught on something the other end was already broken
the ends must be quite fragilelittly pricy but a great cable
you will plug this in and never get  another so why not get it
you may want a longer one though i just use  this from my cable modem to my routerdoes what it should act as a patch cable for internet connection
i only needed a short cable and isnt much more expensive to purchase this ready made one than terminating my own wirei needed only wee little cables to connect computers to switch and these are just the right size
handy to have the light blue everything else is grey or black so i know which cable goes to what at a glancea good quality cable at an affordable price
it has worked well for me and i would purchase additional cables of this brandthis is a simple cat  cord and inexpensive
it works great
i would recommend it
i have has no problemsbelkin foot rj cat e snagless molded patch cable blue worked just as it was i thought it would
pagkaged well and arrived on timethis cable is what it is
i needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works finethis cord works great and the length is just right for me
my only complaint is that the orange isnt quite as festive in person
i thought it would be more neon but its actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords
orange is my favorite color so i paid a little extra for it but i wish i had just gotten one of the cheaper onesnot much to say about wire  it does the job
we use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printerits a piece of cat with snagless ends
it is blue in color and approximately three feet in length
good for making short patch connections
nothing wrong with it at all i would purchase more if neededthe cable was just exactly the length i needed
the no kink feature is really nice
it worked very finei needed an extension that was not wireless so that i could reduce the buffering in downloading and watching movies and this does the job adequatelyand now i have one
i tested it tied to multiple connectors back to the source and it works perfectly with no delays etcgood product and it does the job and great price  seems to be very well made just as most all belkin products arepaying little cash i was not expecting a great deal of volume from this speakers
consider this some cheap non amplified speakers cost near  dollars and for double that price you would expect about double the quality
well let me tell you this baby more than quadtriples the sound of those speakersthe creative labs pc works  system comes complete with the  satelitte cubes the subwoofer power adapter audio inputer cable mounting stands velcro attachments and screws
installation was very easy just plug the speakers in the back of the sub plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the sourcethe included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running
they have recommendations on placement and volume
i plugged my system into a discman first
when i first turned it on i was amazed at the power of the bass
the oomphs really shocked meconcerning the volume this is one of the problems i have with the system
first off the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting
there is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard
when the bass level is at  as set when you first get the system the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes
solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen tomy second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips
these were supposed to be used to mount to a wall
i was obviously skeptical at the concept but i tried it anyway
about  days after mounting them to the wall on one of the speakers the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell
after resticking it almost a day later the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell
after this happened it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wallspeaker is too weak not the velcro
if you decide to use the velcro let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast  days before mounting the speaker to the wallthose  problems are my only ones other than that the volume is excellent
you will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system
its hard to explainhear the sound you will be amazedin conclusion if you think about it the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system
the speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor
if you got extra cash and you want neighbours  or  houses down the road to hear you consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system
but for regular people like me on a budget this system is an excellent solution for any sound needpros low price decent sound unobtrusive easy to set up
unlike some  or piece systems the pc works bass unit is shielded in case you ever need to put it close to your monitorcons though it seems a bit silly  to complain that a  set of speakers offers less than perfect sound  reproduction  heck ive spent far more than that on speaker wire  the  quotsubwooferquot in this set is not really a subwoofer at all
its a  woofer and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response
still the sound  is fine for games and most internet music contentas long as you  arent expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers   dont believe the hype on the box  you probably wont be disappointedi have been using it on my pc for  years now
this madeinchina product proved to be very reliable
it sounds great with games and cd audio
it sounds a lot better than those mini  speakers
for just  i dont see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers
my only complain is the volume distortion
if i push the volume higher than  using the buildin volume control the speakers starts to have some background noisei bought these for the price and really did get more than what i paid for
if youre shooting for looks you wont get it
these speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume controlmakes for too many wires running  around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension  cords already
as far as sound goes i thought they were far more than  serviceable
if you really like to turn it up i would recommend something  a little more powerful but if you have them in a smaller room and such  theyll do great
great price nice sound ugly packaging but a definite  recommendation overallnot very loud and the sub tends to get boomy
other than that best sound for the moneystill is
perfect quothifiquot for a student living in a dormtook it to a friends home with a portable cd player
my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first
they werent laughing anymore when they heard it playingpros its actually a relabled vicam which has been favorably reviewed in the past
excellent low light performance
detachable usb cable is easily replaced with a longer one
comes with an unregistered copy of webcam  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the webcons  apparently com now owns the product so expect no driver updates and no  useful customer supporti bought this camera after reading several reviews here on cnet and also by visiting webcam sites that use this particular camera
i heeded the advice of reviewers to go directly to coms site to download the latest drivers for this and installed those first instead of using the cdrom
no problems on a micron mhz  ram win  machine
i installed the software no prob but be forewarned the webcam software to create your own webcam on the internet included is not registered
you will have to pay for it if you plan to use it for more than an hour
i did pay just because i wanted this specifically for a webcam
im not that crazy about the webcam software though  it feels quite amateurish
alas its the only thing i have so i will stick with it
apparently many other webcam creators like it
the low light performance of this camera is excellent
it self adjusts to many light situations
even the largest image resolution is very clear
i previously had a logitech quickcam web usb camera but the image was quite grainy on that and it was hard to get anything clear in a dark situation
but its user friendliness was excellent
and it had a convenient free membership to spotlifecom that hooked its software into logitechs which did all the work for you to send a webcam image to their site
with a quick refresh time as well
i only wish this com camera had something as useful and easy softwarewise
also no problems with angling of the camera in the direction you want as i read in another review
perhaps i got an improved version
the cable doesnt weigh it down at all and it sticks in the position you put it
com has discontinued this camera so get it while you can for good quality
this camera is quite small unlike the photos
if you are just starting out you might want to consider another cam for ease of usethe styli are of sufficient quality for me to be satisfied with them  they work but i have two complaints about this product  the product is said to be quotsame as stylus provided with productquot and a quotgenuine palm quality productquot
it is neither
these styli do not fit the silo perfectly and the screws at the top and bottom are badly made in contrast to the perfect screws and silo fitting of those that were provided with the product the price is excessive
why should a simple piece of mass produced plastic cost over three uss especially considering the mediocre quality of the product i bought this dvd player and have had no problems whatsoever
the picture quality has been flawless as has the sound

excelente calidad y si quieren tener maacutes espacio para almacenar compren la tarjeta smartmedia de mb mientras duren existenciasotherwise very good  never tested limits of the battery  have used on ac generally  works very well pricey  i would wait for one more generation if too expensivei get only  of battery life on average barely enough to watch a good movieid love to see cheaper packs or a camera battery add on optionit plays r but not rw disksi read the reviews by other people here and am wondering loudly whether they know what these batteries are for
they are rechargeable batteries for highdrain devices that require higher mah rating
nimh batteries or nicd batteries do not hold charge like an alkaline battery so if you have charged an nimh battery and put it in say an alarm clock the batteries will lose charge in less than a month
they are for immediate usages like digital cameras where you need high mah batteries and that digital cameras drain batteries
its more like spend it immediately battery unlike the disposable batteries that discharge in a circuit but drain very slowly when not in a circuit
i use energizer aa batteries for my digicam and they recharge the flash much faster than even the best disposable batteries
a best guide is to look whether the appliance for which you are buying this battery is listed on the package or is identical to those on the package
this v would be a great thing for a toy where the battery drains out fast and you cannot afford disposable ones everydayjust a note if the device is a direct draining one like a motor and not in a solidstate circuit do not use a rechargeable battery since if they are completely drained they cannot be rechargedwe use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does
so far this little rechargable hasnt needed a recharge  is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out  then back on while were sleeping
i gave it  stars because we havent had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just givenworks good much sturdier than the cheapo other brands
definitley a keeperbatteries are expensive no matter what you buy
this recharger is inexpensive and dependable
given that there are four battery docks youll never run out of charged batters
this recharger quickly charges nickel metal hydrido nimh nickelcadmium nicd aaa aa or v rechargeable batteries
the price is fantastic and what it lacks in aesthetics it makes up for in power and speed
when the batteries are charged the light displays green and be warned that it is normal for the batteries to be warm
unfortunately there is no real carrying case for travelgreat for the volt and d but for aa and aaa it does not do as fast as the smaller rapid charger ones form energizerdont travel with the cradle and dont wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop
just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case
this is especially useful for palm viis which cant use the  version of palmos that supports synching through the ir portthis cable  does not have a synchronize button
in order to use it connect the cable  turn on your palm press the hotsynch icon and press the localsynch iconremember that leaving your palm in the cradle or leaving this cable  connected to both your palm and your computer will put an extra drain on  your batteries so you should unhook your palm as soon as you finish  synchinglightweight portable and simple
these words describe both the hotsync cradle that came with my palm iiix and this cable which i just purchased
however if you travel a lot and sync to a laptop or second computer this  cable is the way to goi takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag and  can fit in virtually any luggage pocket and also a suit pocketthere  is no other software to install
just pull the cable out of the bag  attach to your pc and palm and sync using the hotsync icon on the palm  itselfone way that it could be improved would be with a button on the  cable end itself which would trigger the hotsync
this would most likely  make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long  term however
all in all a welldesigned and utterly useful productfound an old palm in my basement and wanted to get it working again
took a chance and bought this cradle to charge it and sure enough it booted up
i have no real use for either the palm or the charger but for as cheap as it was i got it
worked welli bought this palm v hotsync cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolenthe cradle itself works great
it is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the hotsync software installed
a good productit does what is advertised
charges palm v and is also  downloads to pc
that i havent been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female
need an adapter
the charger works great and if it came with a usable connection i would have given it a  star rating i bought these and mine came with  batteries
another  note it doesnt have an electric cord just two plugprongs that flip out  and go into a socket
makes it very compact somewhat elegant
but its  design is such that  it doesnt work well in a horizontal outlet only  in a vertical outlet ie
where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle
in a horizontal outlet the box ends up hanging precariously on its side  prone to falling out of the wall
 if you happen not to have the lower  outlet open it doesnt sit readily in the upper outlet because its upside  down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall
so far it hasnt fallen out in this position but its probably gonna some  day
personally i think a regular electric cord and plug would have been  better  i suspect kodak just wanted to save a few bucks and calls it a  quotfeaturequot
other than that its okay but why did i really spend  this much money
as long as its ul listed buy yourself a cheaper  recharger from a major brand name and make sure its intended for nimh  batteries if thats what you wantits a great charger
you can basically bring it to anywhere you go
but one advice dont buy too many batteries because most of the time you think  that you really need a lot of batteries but after you really bought  a lot of batteries you will realize that you dont need that much
and  regret about wasting money
and if you are out of battery you can just  charge them again two hours after they are full chargedthe only reason i give it  stars its because i only paid about  bucks for it but its a toycheap plastic breaks easy treat gentlythese teac drives are great
i have them for about  months and no problems
just remember  no cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cablei was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive also a teac so suspecting the problem was with the drive itself rather than the motherboard controller cable driver etc i went ahead and bought this one from amazon  well it installed without a hitch and now works flawlessly
file transfers are somehow much much faster  faster than with my drive at work and especially compared to my old drive
funny that floppy drives dont carry x speed ratings like cdroms  if they did this one might be an quotxquotthis drive made it possible to read some old floppy disks on a new pc
the new motherboards do not have floppy interfacesnot much to say here it works for me
i was able to access my old floppy drives
windows detected it without needing to search for driversthe product was delivered on time and seems to work ok albeit a little slow  but floppies are slow
i used this to transfer some data from an older xp machine to my new windows  computer
no problem as far as i can presently determinedoes not work with win out of the box  have yet to find anything to make it work  find an older machine xp and see if you can extract your datai was very happy with this drive
it di exactly as described
simplicity and speed of operationthe drive i received was sabrent model sbtufdb fitted with a mitsui drive
the drive installed completely plug and play and operated without any further actions to install it
the operation is a bit querky on some disks all of which must be high density hd mb disks
i had one problem and discovered the write protection slide tab was open
sabrents latest manual sftusdbnewmanualpdf from their website explains that the write protection tab must not be open so you can see through it  for those of you that have not been through the glorious  floppy era for the drive to function correctly
also i tried several techniques to get some floppies to work correctly  right clicked on folder and selected open ejected and replugged the drive without the floppy in it and several verbal invectives
most of my photos program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily albeit slowly onto the hard drives
overall a good bargain compared to the hassle of trying to install a  floppy into the computer that wasnt designed to accept such an installation
also the floppy is an acceptable media for transferring smaller files from computer to computeroverall this floppy drive is a great value
i have used it in both windows  and linux without issue
it presents a usb mass storage device so it doesnt need a special driverthe floppy drives of old were heavy high quality and made of metal
they were also very expensive
this floppy drive is lightweight and made primarily of plastic
it is made as well as it needs to be  especially considering the very low pricepersonally i wouldnt mind paying more for more heavyduty floppy drive but the reality is there is no point
floppy drives arent needed very often these days and theres no point in paying extra for a device that will get occasional use at mostworks like a charm
i have used it on two computers and it has worked well on both
i am able to transfer data from the floppies to my hard drivei would recommend itdoes as advertised performs well
worked flawlessly right out of the box
everything needed was already present in my wintendo  installi had a bunch of photo disks that i wanted to upload
and this product fit the billinstallation was plug and play  and the product worked flawlesslymy new computer has no  inch floppy drive but i still have several such floppy disks with data i wanted to retrieve
this disk drive read the floppies just fine so i could save the data directly to the computerthis drive is a little slow but it gets the job done
for the price its a great and very useful buywhen you need a floppy disk for an older computer to update bios this works great
portable windows and the bios saw the device without any problem
no brainer purchase if you are going to work on older computersworks well on both osx and windows  havent tried it on linux yet
now i remember how slow floppy disks wereworks well for the price
occasional miss read
unplug and try again fixes the problem
just was trying to recover some old files i found
did the job
cheap enoughi bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive
i plugged the usb drive into a windows  bit computer and it was immediately recognized
this was a oneoff transfer it worked and i wont use it again
dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage
god love anyone still using floppiesthey have the patience of a saint
file transfers are slow because of the old technology not the drive
the th star was for the easy plug and play otherwise my rating is a neutral i received a defective one the first time and it would take forever to load any file or it wouldnt load it at all
so we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge
the second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it
it is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them
it also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesnt accept floppy diskburied deep within the user manual available online at sabrents web site is the troubleshooting observation that you must wait one full minute use a timer between plugging it in and inserting a  mb floppy it does not support any other densityfollow that directive and the device will work pretty much like any ordinary floppybefore reading that directive i was about to join those who swore the device would not work at all
it had repeatedly failed to read any floppy
the only other problem ive encountered in only  hour of testing is that the device driver written by microsoft hung on one occasion requiring a reboot to resolvei would also note that the user manual available online is for a teac drive while the drive they sent me is a mitsumi drive
that said the teac user manual seems entirely applicable to the mitsumi drive
but if you search the sabrent web site for the model number of the mitsumi drive fludrv you will find at this time no information on that model number at allthis unit seems to work great
i was able to read all but three of my  floppy discs
not sure why the three wouldnt read
might be their age
but the sabrent floppy drive was great
it worked from the usb powernever thought i would actually buy a floppy drive in this day and age but when a friend came to me asking for help with stacks of floppies that contained baby pictures taken with a sony mavica back in the dayi did
discs would not read at all in any of the  xp computers at work that still had floppy driveserrors and format disc optionsbut no reading what so everbought this and plugged it up to my win  machineand first disc read like a charm
other discs popped errors but after reinsertingopening  times all would eventually read and i was able to retrieve  of a total  pictures from the stacks of discscant say i will ever use it again and it did take a little wrangling and a lot of timebut  isnt much to spend to retrieve priceless memories from  yr old floppies no other drive would read
money well spentworks very well
not the greatest sound but its just the thing for patio parties etc
make sure to read the manual firstexcellent purchase for the price i paid
works great sending signal from my computer to outdoor location approximately  feet through a wall with window
it is a little testy when i first turn it on often requiring slight adjustments to the tuning to find the proper signal frequency
every once in a while i think uncontrollable outside static also causes issues requiring me to readjust the frequency on the transmitter and receiver
but once working ive rarely had to make adjustmentsand it plays just fine for hoursi have not used batteries yet so i do not know the life when playing music without ac plugin
but overall it has been an excellent purchase and far simpler than wiring outdoor speakers at least for nowbeing able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic
the speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound
on occasion especially very humid days its harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal but overall were happy with the productif you can buy the speaker at a deep discount like we did then youll be happy with the productoverall i am satisfied with this purchase
for the first hour or so i was extremely frustrated with this product
i tried changing the frequency the volume of the transmitting speaker and the location of the wireless speaker a few times with no luck no sound
after some fiddling it would transmit sound for about one second and then go silent
it finally sounded like it had blown
it got very loud very staticky sp
 and then went silent
the power light turned on and off
it did this about three times
i was about to give up
i gave it one more go and it worked
i kept the frequency and even moved the speaker a couple of times to see how it would operate
it is still working
it is not a high end speaker but for the price and what i am using it for
i am very pleased
it does what i bought it forive played with this digital camcorder for about  days now and i am delighted with its quality and features
if anyones disappointed with the quality of the video see reviews below they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations
to get better video youd have to go up  to a ccd camera at about times the cost
as for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy i say just try shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book
you need something  larger to get a good steady picture even with quotsteadyshotquot
i  appreciate sonys innovative digital  because the tapes are less  expensive but you still have the quality of digital recording the pauses  are terrific
im not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the minidv format
i mean how often would i want to trade digital  tapes with someone
i also have the option of playing back any old  or  hi videotapes that were previously recorded and converting them to  digital try that with a minidv camcorder
i like having av outputs and  inputs so that i can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens
the sony infrared quotnightshotquot is astounding
its like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder
the lcd screen on the trv is  wonderful  inches
the x optical zoom is sufficient and going  partway into the digital zoom aint too bad either as long as you dont  try to actually use the full x
i cannot say enough good things at this  point
if i have to find something negative to say i wish some of the  controls were in easier locations to get to while im still filming
all in  all a nifty camcorder that i highly recommendi have had this camcorder for  years and i am still happy with the purchasefor myself being a big guy i was never comfortable with the tiny minidv camcorders out there and the size of the digital camcorders is a nice fit in my hands without being too large and heavy for my wife to use comfortablyi have not had much chance to do comparison testing but the picture quality is very good
in some cases i might think the color is a bit undersaturated but i prefer this to seeing colors pushed beyond what they should be
i have no complaints about the sharpness of the video
in very low light the picture doers become grainy i suspect that new camcorders out there may do a better job in low light than the trvone thing i really like about this camcorder today is that it seems better built than the digital models than sony is currently producing
in addition the lens is a bit larger on the early digital models so low light performance may actually be better than the current ones but i have not done a comparison
i also will recommend the trv for video editing i have had no problems loading video off of the camcorder onto my windows xp pc with a firewire cablemy complaints on the camcorder still uses tape which can jam up inside the camcorder luckily i havent lost a tape yet
ive also been told specifically to use only sony hi  digital tapes with this unit
there is a manual exposure setting which is good for shooting candlelit scenes etc
but the camera is missing a manual white balance that i wish it had
the white balance is done automatically when the camera is turned on when indoors with natural light i will point the lens to a blue object at powerup to eliminate a bluish tint to the picture likewise if the indoor scene is lit i will point at a warmtoned object to eliminate everything looking orange
the supplied infolithium battery is useless
i which sony would include one of the larger batteries as standard
as mentioned above low light performance could be better
the low light settings the camera provides are rarely usedaltogether im very happy with this camcorderthis is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying
for this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift meaning the station you listen to wont change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial great stereo fm on headphones or ear buds the buds that come with it are ok buy a better set and get ready for great sound good am reception and shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like bbc but poor for most everything else
the speaker is only good for talk radio
for music this is a tinny and tiny speaker about one inch wide
if you want a pocket radio that also gets bbc radio canada and voice of america this is the trick
listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase
it also has a good vinyl case
the radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for yearsthis is my first shortwave radio
so not having anything to compare it to this is a good radio
on the amfm side i am hearing radio stations i didnt know were available
on the shortwave end i am amazed what is coming in
in the short time ive owned this ive heard bolivia cuba and either french canada or some other french speaking nation as well as many spanish speaking stations
if nothing else this is a good beginner radio
yes the reception on the sw side are a smidge in and out but its ok  at this point i am just in amazement at what i am able to hear
there may be better radios out there as i delve into this more maybe ill get them
but this is good for me just starting out and is fairly easy to figure outthis radio is a great value in a plldigitallytuned radio
it is being phased out in favor of the etongrundig e
these days there has been a trend for analogtuned radios with digital frequency counters like the grundig  field radio
while these radios are easy to tune and bandscan they do not have any memory presets and the tuning drifts after a few hours based on temperature and humidity
the grundig ybpe on the other hand is a true digital radio and has  memories
the memories are a boon for fmam listeners like me who like to channel surf during the long minute commercial breaks on howard stern and the don  mike show
the direct frequency input is unheard of at this price especially for a grundig
granted this radio is no longer made in taiwan but mainland china the box actually says quality product made in china in big letters possibly in response to the reviews it gets in the passport to world band radio bookthe extras that are included with this radio cost almost as much as the radio itself a quality ac adapter that doesnt introduce that annoying  hz hum a reel antenna a carrying case earbuds and a lanyard that is actually really handy the radio is much smaller than you might imagine from the pictures
it runs on  aa batteries for what seems like forever in fm and only a little shorter when always in am or shortwave cheap offbrand aa batteries are includedi cant really say that the speaker is useful for those who want to hear music but those folks are better off with the ybpe the larger cousin of this unit or even sony icfswg
no singlesideband is available but if youre serious about something like that you wont be buying a radio at this price anywayoverall a good radio for am and fm digital preset channel surfers like me and the occasional jaunt into shortwave
a great clock radio for travelling toothis radio has very good sensitvity to fm mw and shortwave
its sensitivity is almost as good as my grundig pe but some of the other specs arent quite as good which i would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the  pe
its power consuption is better than  the  pe too
its smaller size than the  pe very good designed  easy to use controls good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value
i like this radios abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency i am interested in
this is a fine little radio four starsit works for me 
it also has a few extras such as audiovideo tests 
i dont have any complaints did exactly as it is advertised
be aware however that there is only one tiny brush on the disk
other brands have a few or many if that matters to you
ive always had good luck with maxellsony has sure come up with another great hitthis dvd player is the only one youll ever need to buyat this price and with features you cant beat itbelow are features and details for all of us technical  junkiesalot of these specs are typical of all dvd players but sony has  avery well engineered unitif youre not a techie just go and get one at  your local av store features sony precision drive system  advanced smoothscan high speed search

dimensionsquot x  quot x quoti dont know about the rest of you but i have been researching products to allow me to play music for about  months and ive had a hard time making a decision
ive looked a mp minidisc and regular cd players
i finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because i didnt want the mp craze to pass me by 
heres what i thinkstyling  look good
it is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about  less
the clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume
the pouch is quite cushionany and probably saved me when i dropped it
it does feel and look durable
the blue backlit screen looks attractive
the mp file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but again a minor pointsound  apart from the miserable headphones my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket the sound is good to great
i wasnt looking for quotknock your socks offquot sound anyway but i am quite happy with it
the highest volume setting is not as loud as id like it but it doesnt bother me to any great extentloading music  loading is quick thru the usb port
i use  realjukebox plus the one that costs money along with an addon to manage music loading and i am very happy with it
i didnt like the rio audio manager but it works fine
setup was a piece of cake
very intuitive and fastmemory  mb allows me to place almost any cd i have in memory
i have a mixture of kbs and kbs sampling rates on my mps and at  a single cd is about all that fits on there
the expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handyoverall  nothing really to complain about
a nice little gadget that im very happy withtwo quick negatives about this machine documentation is terrible
youll be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual
software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on  occasaionthe player itself is very good
i would also suggest looking  at the rave mp mp player before you make up your mindthough this is a  neat little machine i am not sure that the usb option works as fast as  its touted in the promotional literature
recommended with some  hesitationthe rio  is a great mp player
it has all the features i wanted pretty good battery life and is a perfect sizeprosbasic easy to use interfacedecent battery life although not as long as the manufacturer claimsconsi hate the software interface
it is slow unstable and poorly designed
i suggest you use windows media player instead to upload files to the deviceas of firmware version  availible from ftpftpscompubmultimediarioriofirmwareexe the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to mb to give it mb of total memory
although this is a decent amount mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaperthere is no windows xp support with the included software
it will work with xp using rd party software which consequently is better than the included softwarei still prefer my rio  and have yet to quotupgradequot to any of the newer mp players
it is light smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use
i used it primarily to listen to audible audio books while commuting and it has been flawless with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly with a checkerboard screen
a quick search at rios website rioworldorg revealed a recovery utility which i ran and recovered my rios firmware
whewthe rio is overall a great product
the buttons and quotinterfacequot on the player itself are for the most part intuitive though it took me some time to figure out the more quotadvancedquot features and are  easy to use even when youre fumbling around in your pocket to change a  songthe fact that the player is unskipable its not like minidisc  where they say it doesnt skip and it really does and extremely  lightweight makes the rio the perfect exercise companion i take it on  every runfor  of purposes  megabytes memory is enough unless  youre a fan of  kb encoding
i can almost always fit ten or more songs  on the player and changing them is easy enough
so dont worry about the  memory sizeits enoughthe software i use a macintosh is well done  and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself
the only  thing i was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs  copy in the scheme of things a very small flaw
the usb interface was no  problem at all even on an older less compatible imac revision athe  headphones included with the player are neat looking but not great  sounding
the fidelity is low with barely any low and lowmidrange sound
assume you will have to spend at least another  for decent  earbudsthe only feature i feel the rio lacks is recording capabilities  like the nomad
but again no big dealoverall a great product
id buy  one for a friendin its own world the rio is great
just an mp player with  meg ram
needs better headphones although they feel snug and secure
also it  would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in mic or input  for a lapel mic
that would blow minidisk out of the water
i must say  however that this is the future at its best
no moving parts removable  smart media cards used to expand memory
the future of music does not  involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk
ive allready downloaded a  ton of online books and music and the quality is greatand remember  mps can be be converted back to a standard wav file with just about any  mp editortry music matcha great product davidcarlinvtelcomthe diamond rio  is simply the best bet out there for anyone buying a mp player for the first time or buying one as a gift
its also far and away the best bet for macintosh ownersas others have noted the only  downsides are the lack of an ac adapter and the horrible headphones that  come with the unit
this may be a bit subjective but the design of the  unit itself is also a bit uninspiringthe unit is however extremely  small light and portable
you wont mind taking it with you in your coat  pocket although im not quite sure if it would be appropriate for jogging  i wouldnt know where to put it
dont be fooled by the packaging which  is overly large and cumbersome the device inside is smaller than it  appearsoh one last nitpick battery life is pretty short
i would  recommend using two sets of good rechargeable aa batteries otherwise  youll be buying new batteries every other daythe rio is a lot like an  ibm thinkpad
its perhaps not the sexiest device on the market and its  a little bit more costly than some other options but it does everything a  bit better than the competition and will last making that bit more you  spent upfront more than worthwhilethe documentation to get started is sketchy at best
i almost took the unit back and thought it was flawed because i could not get it to download to the recorder
ripping from a cd is fast and downloading is also fast  but it appears that battery life might be a problem since it shows  considerable use after a couple of hours
i also have a mini disk player  and will not throw this away since it is more flexible in repeating songs  and the disks arent that big that they are a pain to carry
in essence  the price may be a bit high but the quality is great and the unit is nice  to carry
i am not sorry that i bought it since it is nice to download  songs right from the net
jimthe player is great small light and easy to use
you must either use a mac works great with itunes the riositude program freeware google for itor win
i use mine whenever im outsiderunning yardwork whatever
youll need to replace the earbuds  but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone elses earbuds
the serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggestedalso if you buy a used one make sure you get the usb cable
its proprietary and you cant get it anywhere
refer to rio support coments below
customer support at rio or sonic blue or whatever they call themselves this week is a joke
i will not buy another product of any type from them everthe rio  is great for gym workouts train listening etc
its small light and sounds good enough for listening in an environment with ambient noisemy biggest complaint is the rioport software
there is no simple way to download songs directly to the device from a folder or cd rom
instead you have to import the songs into a database and then create playlists
if you move songs from one subdirectory to another you have to manually edit database entries for every song that you moveda tedious and timeconsuming process
if you readd the songs to the database after the move you get duplicate entries only one of which is valid
however you cant tell which entry is the valid oneanother gripeafter paying this much money for an audio player it seems wrong to have to shell out another  to unlock the softwarein shortgreat product once you get the songs loaded but reaching that point is frustrating at timesi have a  and now a  there are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement
most impt is the usb connection which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free
the software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled
if you download your songs at very high compression sound remains good and capacity can exceed  hours
one suggestion get real headphonesthis is great for jogging and sports but for most an hour of music isnt  enough
if i added an hour more as in memory it would cost me megs
i spend at least  hours hours maxlistening to music while i could  saved it for the new mp playerscapacity in the gigs
arriving later this  year well thats what they saidpeople who will be using it for a  short while every day should buy it but downloading mps with a k modem  is a huge problemits easy to use from buying it to using it
the size  made me realize to get it but im still using cd players for the rest of  the day
it did what i expectedonly jogging but i rather have those with  gigs as in memory instead of only megsits useless during vacations
aaarrrggghhhi bought an svhs unit simply to get the svideo inout plugs
now i can have just one wire svideo going to my tv
the jvc vcr has a nice feature in that when you change channels updown included in the list is  line where i input from my dish
so after the highest tv channel it  just goes to the dish input  nice
i dont need the tv remote except to  turn the thing on
also any time i want to play a tape i just put in a  tape and run it and it just takes over the tv picture
the instructions  were not clear on the plugplay hookup
it didnt seem to be working but  i left it alone for a while and it was ok  it just needed to find the time  signal from my local pbs station which is only sent once per hour  i hope  thats helpful
i havent tried it with an svhs tape
a complaint i have  is that when useing svhs et with a regular vhs tape there is no indicator  that shows the quality that it allowed itself to record at
one could  argue that one could just observe the tape post recording
however id  like to try a tape to see if that important movie will record on that  tape in a high qualitypros excellent value great picture quality in svhs jogshuttle svideo inouts easy setup cables included quality construction lots of features ok tracking super vhs et mode  lines of resolution has u heads for taping in the extended mode can record super vhs on standard tapes do i need to say more
cons tracking problems in ep mode flimsy some color problems super vhs tapes may be hard to find and expensive the menu system is kind of complicated clunky remote traditional programming procedure front display panelthe bottom linethe hru is a bargain  the picture quality svhs ability and features for  are excellenthighly reccommended
introductionmy reason for purchasing this vcr was simple
i wanted an inexpensive vcr with svideo inputs
for those who may not know svideo inputs allow the transfer of  lines of resolution as opposed to the usual  or so transmitted via rca connections
in theory the higher the resolution is the better the picture looksfunctionalityin addition to the vcr there are a set of rca cables and an svideo cable included as well
overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup
the unit has both rca and svideo jacks on the back and a set of rca jacks on the front
this makes it easy to hook up an external source such as a camcorder or something and record to vhs
i have my unit hooked up to my computer it has a video card with svideo out and rca audio outs and i havent actually used the input jacks on the front of the vcr
another feature i really like is the simple touch recording button on the unit
the way i have it set up i can just reach up from my computer and hit it and off it goesthis unit has a jogshuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards
ill have to say this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel
i like it
it just seems more cool than a rewind or fast forward button
lol the unit rewinds tapes faster than my old zenith vcrthe clock is easy to set as well
i think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years
for that matter all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner which makes programming and such even easieri noticed some were saying they didnt like the remote control but i think it is just fine
grant it i dont use it much but the times i have used it i havent encountered any problems with ittwo other things i really like are  having a time code counter display on the lcd so you know how much youve recorded
 when you rewind this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape
its not really super useful but i just like knowing where im atpicture qualityill have to say that for  this unit produces great quality dubs in regular vhs mode
ive been using it for several months now and the video productions ive produced always come out looking very good
and thats the most important thing
i havent dubbed anything in svhs or svhs et mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that
i would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular vhs mode thoughnit pickswhile the outer enclosure looks nice the unit feels cheap
i dont think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions
hopefully this vcr will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isnt moved around too muchthe cheesy glow in the dark keys on the keypad of the remote
i hate it when electronics manufacturers use these gimmicky things
they never workconclusionsfor the money you just cant beat this vcr
the ease of setup and great picture quality are this vcrs strongest points
i highly recommend this vcr to anyone looking for a budget level vcrthe mavica mvc is a good low end camera
if i want to blow up my pictures to x i use my mm slr
megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require expensive memory cards
the camera takes great shots for web sites and email
if you shop around floppies cost almost nothing
with a rebate i bought  floppies
i put  of them in a bag and i took over  photos
it would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards
they used up less room than two rolls of film
the recharable battery lasts forever and i can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card
achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive
the camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development batteries or extra memory
i give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable
if you are looking for a good quotsnapshotquot camera this is a good one
the other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again
this is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the  pictures of the baby or the family picnic
its a fun simple and easy to use camera
how many pictures do you wind up enlarging
i run my favorites on my screensaver and they look greatthis is my introduction to the digital camera
so far im very pleased with the results
the mavica is programmed with five picture formats fine sepia bampw negative art and solarize
it is easy to use even for the beginner
i disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size
i was able to shove it in my purse when i wasnt using it however for the price i wouldve liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case
it does come with a shoulder strap which isnt uncomfortable
the camera has zoom capability but i found that you have to be careful with blurring
i dont fault the camera but the photographer
i have had some experience with blurred pictures and redeyes
photoenhancing software such as photoshop will take care of that
i know because ive tried
the mavica works well with macs and pcs
the only problem i came across was sending the pictures after editing them with photoshop
if your mother doesnt have the same software that you do then you will have to send that blurry or redeyed picture of junior
oh well
i like this camera but if i win the lottery someday i will go out and buy a cd camera because of the memory constraints that these floppybased cameras havea wonderful camera for intrnet use
for auctions emails web sites etc
this is a fine camera
the advantages are great macros down to quotx zoom lens comes with rechagable battery and charger simple downloading of floppies to your pc and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium
however this is not a camera suitable for photos because of the x resolution do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos
for fine photos go to a  or  megapixel cameras
i also own the nikon coolpix  camera and recommend any nikon or olympus camera
only the nikons have great macro capability if this is important a great buy for the money is the olympus the convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat
no proprietary cables or special setup is required
even the newer cameras with the usb interface often require their own goofy photoschmuck software to be installedthe  floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time even with friends  that have older computers or god forbid a mac
almost any computer can  read the formatstandard jpeg used by the mavica cameras
you can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere
try that with a smart card
if you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line or at the  olympus  if you want to make a living on ebay or just have fun with  your camera its hard to beat the mavica for convenience and versatilityi have used this camera since the late s for mostly professional purposes
i write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs andor to accompany job announcements often with almost no prior noticeof all the cameras i looked at in the s this was the one that best suited my needs
the reasons for that follow shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my pc
the x zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when i could not get close to my subject
the camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder a large left hand grip and big button to press when shooting picturesbefore i bought this camera i worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work i do now
in all those years i never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one nor did i use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to efile was easierhaving said that this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results
it is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in eventsbut ive taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes and i took some pictures of the christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a treeso dont buy this to create awardwinning photography
for all the same reasons it doesnt produce very good hardcopy photosbut this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast
thats my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve itin addition the battery charger works fast and ive never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a halfdecade of use
i dont know how this stacks up in the camera industry but its a lot better than most of the electronic equipment i use in the office or at homesimple and easy to use for what it does this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays
on the good side you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures the batteries last for ages and its extremely easy to  use but on the other hand the resolution x in hires isnt good  enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps
if youre prepared to  do lots of retouching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool  and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself but for anything  more than simple website images and casual snaps youd be better off with  a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smartcard memory storagethis is great camera with many features
you can take the pictures in many conditions
the flashlight is good enough for indoor shooting
you can use the arec mode for automatic shooting amp mrec mode for manual shooting
you will have a great photos just using arec mode
just switch on the bottom amp ready to take photos
if you want more professional photos use mrec mode
you can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture
in this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light
the  mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web sending though email amp print in a paper
the worst think that i know is a battery live
this camera its so hungry with power that i thought same with the others digicam
for your convenient use a  set of nimh batteries which can take  to  pictures each set in normal used
you can save your battery live with minimize using lcd monitor to framing the objecti use this camera with a usb sans disk flashcard reader which i find incredibly convenient
i email pictures to family regularly
the quality is matchless but i have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over  megthe quality is so exquisite that get this got a  color matched fabric from a friend in ny based on a close up picture i took  of a printed upholstery piece
i took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf emailed it to my mom and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  btthis is a camera with more capability than i need but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn
i print pics on a hp and the prints look  great
tho the color degrades after a year
printer ink problem not  camerahowever it has a few shortcomings
the paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning
you just cannot see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible
the add on lenses wide angle etc are awkward to use
i have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than i will confess
i even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it
i now have  having  asked everyone i know for one for presentsi bought a nikon coolpix my first digital camera about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it
previously i had owned a nikon  mm quotpointandshootquot camera but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures now the ability to send jpg images to freinds and relatives the  ability to delete pictures quotontheflyquot etc
what i got was a  mixed bag of results  mostly positivebefore i go any further i must  advise you to get the following options  two sets of rechargable nimh  batteries which should be standard with the camera i use the kodak ones  available at amazoncom a highercapacity memory card i use a  mb san  disk  nikons oem and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly  the serial cable is just too slow
i have purchased a sandisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the pcmcia slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transferanyways in use the camera is  fantastic
initially i was using the x resolution setting to save  space but with the new larger card i now use the x setting with  moderate compression for all pictures
i find that the card can hold about   pictures at this resolution
once i find a picture i like i use the  microsoft photo editor software comes with office and reduce the  resolution as appropriate web pages etc
i store my  quotkeepersquot on cdrom at the higher resolution  you can always  reduce resolution and sizethe picture quality is great
the flash  however should only be used up to   any further and your pictures come  out too dark
nikon usa has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download  which i recommendlow points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off
i find myself zooming out every time i turn the camera on  this eats up  your batteries and takes time
the flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time
sometimes the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures so a bit of spontaneity is  lostthere are now newer cameras out there
i find that the   megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that given the  recent price reductions i would buy this nikon now if i were in the market  todayoverall this isnt a bad digital camera for most types of photography
its quite easy to use and perfect for the beginner
the only real gripes i have are the limitations in the size of the compact flash it uses and the fact that after a time the battery compartment wont stay closed
otherwise ive taken some fantastic pictures with this camera
in fact id have to say it does better than some of the newer nikon coolpix cameras like the l which i also have
ive found newer models to have focus and flash issues as well as severe shutter lag
this may not be comparable in resolution but its quite enough for most uses
you dont need more than  megapixel for decent resolution unless youre doing huge blowups of photographsi also own a sony mavica and a kodak dc so this isnt my first digital camera
with the  i found that i needed to read the manual with care  because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to  just quotgo for itquot after blowing through several dozen test pics  i started to find the tricks to metering autofocus and nikons digital  simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera
the quality of the pictures once you get the hang of using the camera in a  particular setting is amazing
this is the highest digital quality ive  experienced with a digital camerai love my nikon
it was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer
she had outgrown it and was tired of me complaining that i saw this or that and wished at the time i had a better camera than my phoneif you have never used one of these before it will take a little getting used to
the camera pivots in half which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens
the whole thing rotates freely  degrees with snaplock settings at each  so you can watch yourself taking a picture of you or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder
the flash is a bit annoying as it automatically fires in even remotely lowlight circumstances
a simple press of a button disables the flash but then you have a longer exposure time about one full second which means that you have to keep your hands really really still
just for fun try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakesthis camera is really at its best during the day
it should win an award for being the official picnic or even beach camera
it really is point and shoot but it has an easy to learn and use zoom automanual flash and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery
the live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at
my guesstimate is something like  framespersecond of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picturethe short version it is selfcontained easy to load and swap the memory card
it takes high resolution photos and is so easy to use and durable that a  yearold could handle it carefully
stock up on extra aa batteries though
it eats through  of them in a few days of usehope this helpsamazons review still touts this as a quottop of the linequot camera when nikon released the third generation coolpix  months ago
the   fixes all the complaints people had with the  and the  shown here
it also ups the resolution to k x  megapixels
its a fantastic  camerathat much said the  is more expensive and if you dont need  the extra resolution the  remains a great choice at a lower price
i  just take exception to amazon presenting it as quottop of the  linequotthe swiveling body on the   and  allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down or at your knees  with the lens looking up and still be able to see your composition on the  lcd display because the lcd is on the other half of the body from the  lens
you just twist to see the lcd regardless of where the lens is  pointing
other digital cameras dont do this and its really useful
its  made possible by the fact that these cameras especially the  are so  good at autofocus autoexposure and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the lcd to compose and frame the shot not worry about  anything else and get a great resulti have owned this camera for over  months now and i really like it
the image quality is stunning and i didnt find it all that hard to figure out how to use it
the controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomicallythe camera is also slow i think this is true with most  digital cameras
you click the shutter and about  or  secs later it  takes the picture
this may not sound like a big deal but last night i was  trying to take pictures of my infant son and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the cameraa significant short coming is  the built in flash
its nowhere near powerful enough even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is  feet away
images often come  out too dark
this wouldnt be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash but there doesnt seem to be one
also the camera tends to  create quotred eyequot a lot which you can correct if you have  photoshop but thats more work than i want to dothe camera does eat up  a lot of power i agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries
you can get a set of nimh batteries and a charger for about   bucks it takes  aa batteries
id suggest getting at least  aa  batteriesi do suggest getting extra memory i have  megs and one of  those usb memory card readers its a lot faster than a serial portgreat camera once you learn the menus and buttons
advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy
i have avoided the autoeverything cameras because i like controlling all of the creative process
because of  this it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons but it was  not hard
the coolpix  still allows you to control the creative process  but i would recommend a good book on digital photography such as real  world digital photography to get you started especially if youre a film  junkie such as myself
note a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger compactflash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable nimh batteries
the first two replace your film and  processing budget
one nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card
mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot
a light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a quotspeed ratingquot of iso  and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash
if you must use flash get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and as with all small cameras  produces flat featureless images
youll also need access to a good fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual
a copy center such as  kinkos should work
this is not a camera for the quotinstamaticquot  crowd
hint negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an outofthebox instant hit but with a little creative work the camera  does well
i may trade up to the coolpix  in a year or two after the  price comes downworks just finei use this item at work and its a good product that serves it purpose
i would recommend this itemthis replacement labeling tape is for a low end brother labeler
amazon had best price and shipped quicklythis tape works fine for my label printer
the adhesive holds pretty well
it is not very flexible once you have it stuck on  i would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the flag method
i have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind ifwhen you remove themlabel tape works as advertised on brother pt
just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge
it works wonderfully but i think that its pretty sad that i paid more for the tape than i did for the whole labeler
regardless im still very happy with the productbrother has hit a home run with their labeling tape systemsi used to spin the old dynamo labeler to make labels but nomorei just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what i paid for the whole unit with a couple of these
overall it works as described so i only docked it  star for the priceofficial brother mtape does the job right in the label maker
cheaper than all the local office stores
organization is pricelessthese cartriges are well build and the tape dispenses smoothly they are a little prices but it does a good jobbrother makes good labelers that works and sticks
this is a convenient model and is useful in everyday labeling
not too expensive and stays on the items you applyi went to staples at first and found their price to be very high
since it is retail packaged the produce is the same everywhere so i saved buying here important note this product also fits thebrother pt labeler
the description only lists the newer model labelmakers
i love my labelmaker and cant imagine life without it
i label rubbermaid totes charging cables av equipment boxes leftovers for the freezer etcand it always sticks to everythingand actually comes off cleanly as well
just make sure whatever youre labeling is dustdirt free and youll be good to gothe product arrived in a very short time
the price was very cheap
i am extremely satisfied
i would recommend this company to anyonepricey but the print holds well even outdoors in a new england winter
also the cement is durable
easy to usei love brother labelmakersthey are the easiest to use
this standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time
will not stick on large plastic containers very well but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar coffee decaf flour etci wish brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels
it takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itselfthis fits the sample package that came with the label maker
well the whole new label maker is like double this so you pay for the labelsworks well with label printer and is easy enough to use
overall i dont use the system frequently enough to commentblack print on white backing tape
easy to install and prints great labels no faulty letters everything comes out printed properlyi love my brother ptouch labeler and i purchased more to stock up
this labeler has worked well for us and i use it for everything at homethis cartridge fits well and ive purchased it a few times already
it works well and has no problems
it is authentic and cost effective for our needs labeling leftovers in the fridge so that we dont poison ourselves with  month old food that should have been thrown out last weeklovely useful product
works as expected
buti would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a much larger and longer tape cartridge
if brother were to increase the label tape length it would only cost pennies to do sois brothers profit important enough to damage the companys public reputation
why not offer a more equitable costvalue ratio to customers
if the company brother had given me the labelling machine free of charge i would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumablesi ordered extra tape for the brother  personal handheld labeler
knowing it would be used the tape was backup for itwhat i like about this labeling tape is the precut line running along the back of the backing paper
it makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when youre ready to stick the labeli did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past
the tape jammed upon installation and i had to throw out a new tape
you can avoid this by being careful during tape installationgood quality product and looks good
one thing though it has to feed blank tape so you can cut it resulting in an inch of lost tape for every printi got my wife the brother ptouch labeler pt i think to use in organizing things primarily the  or so gallon plastic tote bins we use to store things in the basement and garageweve found through a few years of experience that the  is superior in longevity to the smaller width tapes for labeling these plastic bins  little to know spontaneous peeloff that you get with a smaller width tapei think it has something to do with the surface area to volume ratio for the adhesive and the slightly irregular and porous nature of the recycled plastic binsin any case we like this  aside from the durability  you can print large font so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance saves having to take everything out etcgenuine brother tapes are the only way to go
clean and correct printing each time
i like this item
thanksreasonable price ad it works all the timethis product never disappointed me for labeling folders and some asset lists i label themlong time user of brother labeler  only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges
this was a good price but kinda slow shipping
otherwise okupdate  these tapes can get pricy
buying three or four tapes can add up to more than the cost of the printer
this is how i deal with it
order three or more online at amazon
remember these labels help you organize your life and or business and or customers and i have come to believe the value of this outweighs the cost by a long shot
white on black is the best as i have tried black on clear but if the surface is dark then you cant read the label
i have used whit on black but the letters are not as clear  the advantage is it looks classier then the white labelsthree years ago i purchased brother ptouch pt there is an update to this model which is even better for about 
it is larger and heavier but you get much better results than the smaller brother pt which i bought around  and replaced the cutter a couple of years ago
the pt has usb and i recommend downloading the update drivers and free software from brother because it lets you get more out of the tape reviewed here because you can print  lines instead of  and any font installed on your computer as well as many types of boarders
you can even save the labels you make and open them later to reprint
once you go the usb route and see how nicely you can arrange your labels it is hard to go back to the little handheld unitsreview starts herethis is the classic black letters on white tapethe magic the tape is separated from the backing in the label printer then the letters are burned with a thermal print head from the inside of the tape then it is stuck back down the backing and comes out of the machine
this is why the letters cannot be wiped off even with alcohol or other cleanersblack letters on white works on all surfaces
i have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface
if surface is dark it is hard to see the label
black on white is also the cheapest most common tapebrothers price is on the high side and i dont know of any generic aftermarket tapes
amazons price is about the best i have found and i trust amazontip buy three tapes at a time so i dont run out and it makes the cost easier if you take your lumps in one shot
if you buy the tapes one at a time you will be reluctant to use them when you need themtip ways i use brother tapeson the ends of power cords like the type that comes with typical wireless router
by labeling them it make it easy to relocate cords or pack up and move or if a power pack gets separated from what it belongs to it is easy to match upcar i label the date and miles i last changed the air filter fuel filter or battery etc
these labels will last for years in your engine compartmentcustomers sadly i used to label computers with a magic marker
yuk
labels look very professional
i also add notes such as be sure to remove cable x before y etcmy p international p kill a watt ez electricity usage monitor that i bought on amazon this summer
i put a label on it that says something like push up  times to show watts which is the only function i use
i also measured every electronic thing in my house and put a brother label on it that showed the power use when offon and idle if that appliesi labeled my brother cx computer printer with the info for the generic ink cartridges  amazoni will label a flashlight what bulb type prxx and where to buy it
i label hard drives with the size data i bought it etc so i can see that without removing it to read the label
if its for a customer i record the date installedtheres a million uses for these labels and the make your life more organized and better the bible says god is not a god of chaos  amenthe brother labeler is a great tool around the house
i use it to label my files tools kids items and many other things
the black on white tape is perfect for any jobblack on white is the best
it is easier to read than white on black the letters dont come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes and black on clear
black on clear requires that the background is light or clear
i used to label an old power mac g cube computer and it looked great
other times i tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to readthe special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black
brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life
i have two brother printers a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by usb model pt
you get free software from brothers website and you can save your labelsthis is a good label
sticks well and stays on
only thing is its hard to peel the back of the tapeit fits my labelerit does the color scheme as advertisedits the right width
its stickywhat all can you say about tapegood price for acceptable yellow label tape used in a brother ptouch pt
will probably buy some more maybe some red and blue versions next timeit is what it is
it works but when removing the tape months later it seems to leave residues
i had no problems other wisei use to but this black on clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me
the clear part was really clear  now its sort of a matte clear but its ok for most things you put it onthis tape is a dull matte silver with black lettering  perfect for my application
do not expect shiny silveri bought the ptouch and wanted some label refills that were black on clear
this was perfect for me
not much to say but it is what is advertisedi use this on my motorcycle to listen in on the road captains conversations while tripping down the road with the hogs
it works very well especially as a simple monitor and the channel switching  swapping is handy since they change from   to  and dont tell anyone
compact  nice packagethe radio is made of great quality but like others have wrote the range when its in carry mode is very bad
so if your thinking about using this as a bug out item dont
to use this for a bug out scenario wouldnt work unless the person youre talking to is standing right next to you
in car mode with a antenna its cool as heck
it has all the bells and whistles in place back light weather rechargeable battery pack with power cord  and moregood job midlandflexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception
good product put together nicely and has tons of features
minor annoyances the clip behind the radio is not the best feature the lcd light does not stay on long enough and the speaker volume should be louder
lots of upsides well covered in other reviews with some minor but annoying downsidesneeded a cb for a jeep jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year
perfect for this radio
price is right easy install good for a jeep where theres  room for full size perm cb
did a perm antenna install ran the coax just to the right of the console keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when i need it
cant speak for the portable performance but as an incar cb its perfect for occasional usei use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas  listen to the truckers discuss road conditions
i can hear pretty good with this
talk power may be limited  even though ive got a good roof k antenna with a good sws
acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving
i wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that i dont need to constantly fiddle with itthis little radio is feature rich the features just require you to be a half mile or less to the other radios
using the adapter to plug into my trucks antenna i didnt get that more range at the most maybe bumped the range up to a mile and thats it
this radio would be good for a vehicle that didnt have a cb permanent mounted or even a rental when going on vacations to get road reports from semis and to listen to the weather chanel on it
would also be good to have to and talk between two cars on a tripi shopped all around and read hundreds of reviews of hand held  cb s  i used to travel aback and forth from tempe az to chicago when i was in college
i used a  mounted cb for eight years and i relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the  hour trip
so nostalgia set in before xmas and i bought this unit
and a second one for my son who commutes to college
the reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit
not good
i bought a lil wilson magnet antenna
on the highway today my radio checks indicated i was getting a transmission range of  miles
not bad at all
brought me back to the college commute
i recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers and their kids  and i should add that the noaa weather channel is great
cb radios saved my life a couple of times
im back  innice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles
ride in a club where many members have these
one of the only suitable cb for a bike that doesnt come with an oem cb
range will depend on antenna
rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances
would guess  mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions
weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector
also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses  aa rechargeable batteries
i am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit
the other battery pack holds  regular aa batteries
both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options
i dont see why  rechargeable batteries couldnt be used i the  battery holder
you would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular chargerconvenient size great adapter arrangement for use as a mobile cb
both reception and transmission are very clear
reception from a distant source can be hard to hear on the builtin speaker
i havent tried a headset yet but i think that would help
range with an external antenna is good  several miles with no problemdisplay is good but i wish the display had a backlight instead of lights off to the sides and i wish there was a way to keep the lights on when plugged into the car adapter
lit keys for night use would be nice toosolid construction
the one i received was flawlessthe removable antenna is really convenient
i added a  collapsible to replace the rubber ducky that it comes with to extend the range when using it as a handheldi use this compact cb while traveling and it work just fine it is small and with the cigarette plug option i dont have to worry about batteriesi used this radio on  mile  day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time keep in mind though it only has a  watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was withglad i didnt need this sooner
the radio moved on the super saver shipping timeline even with mandatory  standard shipping
i could have walked to ky for pickup in the time standard shipping took
the vehicle mount antenna ordered same day standard shipping from cricket ventures amz reseller arrived four days before the radioon the other hand the radio and antenna are superb
an exceptional package of capabilities size and features
midland would do well to copy this product architecture across their other families of htmobile products gmrsmurs business bandbuy the radio
just dont expect timely deliverya nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicleproduct is solid
the pluginportable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil wilreception is not great a couple miles but typical unless you plug into an antenna again typical
full scan and  scan is a solid featurenothing amazing about it nothing bad about it
great back up when cell service is not availableim not a serious cb user i use ham and gmrs mostly but this is pretty handy to stick in the pickup when im pulling the travel trailer for a road trip or camping
range was about what youd expect without skip about the best you can get on cb is around   miles with a decent antenna with a  ft antenna
dont be too disappointed with radio activity cb isnt what it used to be what youll mostly get is truck drivers if youre on the freeway and just about nothing anyplace else although i did pick up a couple of drug dealers conversing in spanish a few days ago
recommended if your intention is to have it around in your vehicle for road infothe only reason i did not give  stars was the lack of ssb on this unit
otherwise is is exactly what i have been looking  for
newer trucks dont have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on innice small unit
the range isnt that great but it picks up the weather stations
fits right in the glove boxi am overall pleased with the midland  radio
out of the box i was picking up a few transmissions with the rubber ducky antenna mostly truckers from the highway about a  miles away and even some powerhouse channels from across the country
using these as mobile units you could probably transmit to maybe  mile between two identical units with the rubber duckies which isnt bad when youre out in the field with a buddy
once i had this setup in my jeep however i was easily receiving transmissions from  miles away
i have this setup with all firestik equipmentfirestik ii antennafirestik stud mountfirestik  coaxim also using a rugged ridge jeep mountthe total setup yielded    swr  pretty darn good on a jeepa few notes about using this in your vehicle
its convenient when you dont want to mount a full size unit within the cab of the vehicle
its so small that i can store it in my center console or the glove box  which is nice for jeep owners since you can easily store it away to prevent theft
this unit has all of the functions of a full size cb within a tiny package the size of about a normal cb mic
the sound is very clear and the transmissions come off clear from what ive been toldthe only thing i really didnt like about this cb is that the product description says full led back light however the back light only stays on for  seconds even when powered via the car adapter
i figured that it would only turn off after a few seconds with the battery pack installed which makes sense but theres no reason the light cant stay on when youre in the vehicle
its also only lit by  leds  one from each side of the display  not technically full back lighting but clear enough to read the display from a few feet away
the only issue is when you want to continually toggle channels etc
at night youve got to keep hitting the light button first
also which would be really nice is to have lighting behind the buttons sort of like a mobile phone
there is no lighting behind the buttons so youve got to remember where each button is and what they do for night drivingoverall this is a  out of i took this little unit on my bmw motorcycle for a  mile spin
worked the whole time even when we were getting rained on
it didnt really say anything about being water proof but did ok in light rain
buttons were a little small for my gloves but i dont think this unit was design with motorcycles in mindpurchased this radio as a hold over until i mounted my other radio in the truck
worked fine
speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows downi was intent on using an old cobra  in my new suv but when i tested it hadnt been used in about eight years there was no transmitting
its not worth getting a  and  year old unit fixed so i was in the market for a new cb
sadly there is no room to easily mount a pro size cb in my xterra and cubbies and flat spots are scarcethe midland  along with the cobra  wxst seem to be better than a handheld only cb
the cobra may be nice but the midland is so much more versatile
you can use the  inside or outside of the car with battery power both adapters for alkaline and rechargeable batteries as is a charger for nimh or nicad batteries and a rubber ducky antenna outside with batteries and antenna or in car with dc power and an external antenna
with the rubber duck antenna range is very limited for transmitting but it receives cb and weather okay
with an external antenna you give up nothing over a regular cb
i mounted my antenna to the roof rack and have a  ft firestik fs and a  foot firestick firefly to use as needed
with the  foot reception and transmission are worlds apart from the rubber antenna as is weather
with the  foot antenna i get all three noaa weather stations and two are  miles away and transmitting can reach out easily  miles which is fine for legal cb power
the main cons i have is the lack of a constant backlight and lack of cover for bnc connector when not using the rubber antennaive had cbs since the late scobras unidens and most others
midland does and always has made a good product
this is no different
the handhelds are great if you are in an rv campsite looking for others or on the road searching for traffic infoface it the s are gone  and even then power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of otherwise friendly local chats
in the area im working near canada i get really tired of watt skip talking power hounds out of orlando florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in la that you cant hear your neighbor a mile away
face it we arent buying bad radios we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guysdont think badly of the midland hh
it is a good little watt radio
its output with a lil wil magnet mount antenna is comparable to a cobra ltd with a suitable tuned antenna
get your swr  or so on  get  and  as close as you can and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles
on a good day you can get  milesand thats all they are really designed for
dont forget the more sunspots the further you can reachand sunspots are starting to pick up nowgood radioi gave it stars because theyve never offered this handheld with a mated external magnetmount antennamaybe i expect too muchbut you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount and add an antenna for the same pricei have this attached to a  firestik on my jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where were within a mile of one another
i really dont use cbs for anything more  like longdistance chatter with truckers and whatnot
its got some cool features but honestly i havent used them
either way this thing is good for what i use it for
plus when camping we can go mobile with it
 good buddyupdateok i received a replacement radio from midlandit took about  weeks for the replacement to arrive
it came in a small brown box not the retail package that i sent it in
all the parts were piled in the box with packing peanuts
the radio and accessories were all fine not beat up or scratched
i guess it didnt look expensive enough for ups to bother trying to smash to pieces
the only thing wrong was the wrist strap was not in the box
i probably wouldnt have used it anyway
i put some rechargeable batteries in the battery holder and turned the radio onand i was receiving skip so the problem was fixed with what is probably a refurbished radio
looks new though and it works
i should not have had to pay shipping to have a defective radio replaced but thats life
i like the radioreceived the radio and placed the batteries in the battery holder and turned the unit on
did not receive any cb signals but not too suprised with the flexible antenna
checked out the weather channels and received them fine
took the radio out to the truck and installed the vehicle adapter and connected the radio to a wilson  antenna and flipped through all  cb channelsnothing but background hiss
i backed the squelch all the way off and got the same result
connected the cobra wxst back to the antenna and received skip on almost all channels
reconnected the  checked the swr all channels below  still no cb reception
packed the radio back in the box called midland sent radio to midland and now i will wait for a few weeks and think about the extra  it cost to own this radio due to shipping to midland
customer service at midland was pleasant and spoke english
i could have sent the radio back to abetterwaytobuy but the turn around time from midland seems to be shorter than the long wait i had the first time from abetterwaytobuy
also i think that midland will probably be sure that i get a working unit when they send one back
so i cant comment much on the radio itself as far as performance but will update this once i get the radio returnedas a backup for when you are traveling in areas with spotty cellphone coverage this is a nice to have device
also listening to drivers is entertaining unless you are offended by blue languagewell made switches into hand portable format in seconds
great range with a vehicle antennathis is a small cb it works good and has some nice features
i would recommend this product if you are looking for a versatile handheld cbi have had this radio for about one month now
the speaker stopped working
i had to buy an external speaker
i saw several complaints about the same issue when i was researching the radio
however the radio still transmits very well and receives well also
i continue to recommend it but i suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radiothis unit fills a niche for those who want basic cb capabilities in a convenient and flexible form
this is not for people who want great range or will rely on for emergency usethis little convertible isnt much bigger than some cb microphones
im particularly pleased with the three modes of power aa batteries nimh rechargeables or v vehicle
the mobile vehicle adapter includes both a plugin cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna
i use the midland  magnetic mount it will tune to swr of about  on channels  and  to significantly increase the range to several miles depending on conditions
as a mobile radio it works pretty well given that its a one small size fits all type of unit
but what i really got this for was to use it as a handheld walkietalkie
and thats where it truly shines
the provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short but it severely limits your transmit range
use it if you dont need to talk more than a couple hundred yards
i mounted the cobra ha ta telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance
battery life is pretty good
the rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage
plug it into the charger overnight and youre ready for the next day
the weather alert is a nice feature tooall in all a very useful small radio that really comes to life when connected to a decent antenna
recommended for those who need a versatile cb for automobile and handheld applicationsgreat cb for light use
i love that it doesnt have a whole box to mount
makes it possible to install discretely without tearing up your dash
and i love having the weather bandmy only gripe is that there is not a black cap to put over the silver portable antenna outlet for a cleaner look when its mounted in a vehicle
i have tried to find something to put over it and i keep striking out
maybe somebody can suggest somethingno space in yukon so just what i needed
purchased an external speaker so works just like the big boys except for a little less rangegreat radio
i bought with to be portable
has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries
also can plug in an antenna if you want
range is short with the stubby but that is to be expected
love that is has the scan feature and weather
for the price its hard to beatthe midland   channel cb radio is a solid handheld cb with just a few flaws that prevent it from being absolutely great
if you are looking for a truly portable cb radio this is the one to get bar none
it is important to understand the capabilities of this radio
many people rate radios poorly because their expectations far exceed the capability of the radio
most cb radios are  watts which is generally good for a distance of  miles
as with any radio there are a lot of variabilitys that will impact the effectiveness of the radio
cb radios are not for long distance communications
if you need long distance comms then you should consider a ham radio which requires a license from the fccpros multiple methods to power the radio car charger alkaline batteries and rechargeable batteries  watts weather channels work great and can be very valuable quick button to transfer between channels  and  very easy to use radio itself is well built can use high setting for  watts or low setting for  watt which will save batteriesconsthe adapter for the car charger and alkaline batteries are very stiff when removing from the radioboth alkaline and rechargeable battery cases seem delicate especially when being separated to put the batteries in the case
time will tell how durable these will be over the long runrecommendations upgrade your antenna to thecobra hata handheld cb antennawhich in my case significantly improved reception
it is also good to have a backup antenna get thewilson  watt little wil magnet mount antennafor your vehicle
you will not get reception if you use the rubber duck antenna in your vehicle get the bookemergency radio communicationsby caleb watts for a good understanding of radio capabilities rules  regulations and a good example of an emergency radio planoverall assessmentthe midland   channel cb radio is a very flexible cb radio that can be used in multiple situations such as in your vehicle or out hiking
the radio itself is very well made and while the battery cases seem a little problematic they are not a deal breaker but they do cause me to give this radio  stars instead of if you are looking for a handheld cb radio the midland  is a great choicei bought this because i didnt want to install a hard mount cb
i park on the street
when i park at night all i do is slide it out of the holder and take with me just like my radio face plate
volume output is barely adequate
i like how the acc plug and exterior ant are integrated into one piece
makes it easy to talk feel like you have mike on regular cb
i like the buttons for dual watch and scan which are easy to press by feel when driving
it will beep when sw is made
the receive seems to be good and tx is good
you cant do much with  watt output
so much for freedom of choice
uncle sam wont let me up the power
 everyone is abiding by that rulethis packs a lot of features for a decent price
the different power options are great
if you are going to use it for distances farther than car to car you need a bigger antennae or a roof top onethis antenna isnt going to provide great range or performance but it works ok in situations where you cant easily hard wire a cb antenna
i installed it on my travel trailer window to avoid drilling a hole in the roof or exterior wall
works fine for short range cb communications in the campground which is all i wanted to begin withi read all the reviews before buying  and was a little worried that it might not meet expectations
but it has worked out greatit was a thrill to see saturns rings and view jupiter
the moon comes through bright and clear
you can see other heavenly objects even galaxies
with it
you wont see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books  but youll see the dim shading of them in parts of the skyits compact and portable  so you can bring it to the beach etc
our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much nightsky viewing  so portability was a musta scope that gave a better view at the same price would have been too big
and a better portable would have cost too much
this one was just right for us
if price is not a problem get a better portable scope
if size is not a constraint then spend less on a larger scope
otherwise this one will do finemust have add ons a tripod see my review there
the computer controller youll never find a lot of the night sky objects without one
one or two good night sky books to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxiescomplaints it would be nice for this and all scopes to see some pictures of how nightsky objects will really look with it before buyingwe purchased the etx  and we found the autostar to be necessaryit was very easy to plug into the telescope and turn on but getting the telescope aligned was another story
the first night we went out with just the autostar and the telescope assuming that we would have enough to get started
we were very wrongin order to align the telescope and get the autostar working the unit first asked us to find true north
yikes
we gave it a rough guess
we were off compleetely we would find out the next evening
next was the exact time which we also guessed on our inaccurate watches
then we picked the nearest city which is about  minutes away
then the unit asked us to find two stars in the sky and identify and align them in the telescopes eyepiece
the stars that the autostar gave us to find were not exactly wellknown stars and they werent in a part of the sky that was devoid of other bright stars
without a map of the sky we were lost
pollox rigel castor were some of the stars we have come to know well through the autostar
needless to say we did not get the autostar working that nightthe next night we went out equipped with not only the scope and the autostar unit but also a compass to find north a detailed map of the sky to find the stars it was asking us to and a watch that had accurate time on it
before we headed out we took the time to enter in our exact latitude and longitude into the autostar
that night was a great success
after a short time spent aligning our two base stars in the scope we were off to explore the universe and beyond
we saw saturn venus jupiter the pleiades the orion nebula and several messier objects that eveningi highly recommend the autostar but wish that the booklet would have warned us that we needed to be prepared with the compass star map latitudelongitude and exact time to make our experience with it successful
the only drawback to the unit was that it needs to be aligned and reset every time it is used but its not like there are other competing units to use
its well worth the money and enhances the experience with any meade scopethe astrostar is a great etx accessory
my favorite feature is its quotgive me a tour of whats good tonightquot it is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its quotidentify thisquot feature
the only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work
the instructions werent that clear between the scope the tripod and the astrostar book
my recommendations to you remember to align the scope to true north i hold a compass on the lens tube use a bubble level to level the tube set your watch to the second on the nights you go out and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned
do these four things and i guarantee youll have a great night of viewingi have mixed feelings about this category of laptop locks
it wouldnt stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters
it will stop the casual impulsive thief who walks by in the libraryanyway as this particular product goes it is well manufactured and works smoothly
i use it in the law library where you know and trust most everyone if i have to be up and down a lot like when im doing research throughout the library
it provides a little peace of mind in such situationsthanks for readingi just got back from a two week vacation and i used this  lock for the first time
i looked all over the place and aside from the plumbing under the sinks  which didnt seem like a good idea  the only place i could loop it to was the bedframe
this is in no way critical of the device just you might want to consider what youre going to attach it tothe only flaw was a bit of a burr in the cable sticking through the plastic coating which i filed down
you might want to inspect it when you take it out of the box so you dont get surprised and bleed all over the placethe cable is of course vulnerable if a thief has a substantial pair of cutters i lost a bicycle locked with the same kind of cable many years back
but this seems like a goodenough product considering that limitationthis computer lock works great with my laptop
the key takes some trial and error to be turned correctly but it all works out in the endits not rocket science to make a well functioning laptop lock
and this one works really well if you like me prefer a key over a combo lock
i only gave it a  because the first one that i ordered came with the wrong keys and i had to get a replacementthe concept and the quality of the product leads me to believe it will work when needed
it is easy to use with part wrapped around a stationary object and the other end entrenched in the computer
someone trying to steal the computer will break the case if the cable is attached
the cable appears to be heavy duty and a large pair of nippers would be needed to cut itnothing sucks more than when you are sipping on some tea studying at a coffee shop and you need to go pee
however you dont want to leave your lab top unattended
thank god i now have this cable to secure my investment
its lightweight and convenientpros cable is very strong cable isnt bulky fits into my laptop long enough for me to use kensington has a registration process where if you loose your keys they send you a new replacement set comes with a nice small rubber strap thing to wind the lock together when not in use sleek feel which doesnt bother the handscons difficult to lock because sometimes the piece right in front of the locking mechanism turns the locking mechanisms location makes it a little difficult to insert the key properlyoverall the lock is great
its a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed
other then the difficulty locking it the cable is awesome
its very strong and bends easily so it can be anchored to something
i was very pleased with this lock and it does everything i neededwanted it to do
i would definitely recommend this to a family member or a friend to use as wellworks great but very obvious
does the job we are asking it to do with no complaints
great that it has two keyswas on my way to a trade show and worried my laptop might leave me for anotherthe kensington did the jobwhat it is  security lock for kensington compatible deviceswhy you need it  this is great for a dorm room or other location to provide light security for any kensington lock compatible device most laptops and other portable devices have have this security port
i have used them for several years in many environments and they work very wellwhy i like it  robust cable that is long enough to secure your item in most locations reliable lock kensington warrantysummary  this was a very good deal for the lock itself which is why i bought my customers are always looking for something like this
i would have given it  stars but the sellers shipping fees were pretty highi got mine at a nd hand store for a buck and i love it but it does take some wiggling to get outfits like a glove and very streamline
works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing  temptation of otherslocks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around
secure and reliable locksetmy son leaves for college next week and may never use this lock
in the instructions we read about the tamper proof feature
if someone tampers with the lock youll see a red line on the lock and no key will work
the instructions are to call the  number which i did just to see what the next step we would take
we were told that we would have to call a locksmith and kensington would pay up to  for the locksmithso lets say my son is at the college library with his locked computer
he gets up and someone tampers with it or maybe some of the kids are just fooling around with it
when he returns he cannot unlock it from the library table
so now he has to call a locksmith and wait possibly missing classes
what if the library is closing the computer would have to stay there
what if he cannot get a locksmith for a day or so the locked computer still sits at the librarywe bought a combination lockthis product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it
i first tried it on my wifes new hp laptop and it worked well
then i decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame
i quickly removed it from my macbook
since it didnt stay on my macbook long it doesnt seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook
it will damage the frameworks well on my  inch imac
its secure enough for sure but the attachment isnt tight against the computer
it has some jiggle room
doesnt look like this effects the security factor thoughpros thicker than many other cable locks ive owned
locks and unlocks easily so you dont have to spend five minutes trying to lock and then another five minutes trying to unlock your computer
it does wiggle around on my netbook which is why the rubber bumper is really nice but doesnt wiggle around on my laptop
so whether you get the wiggle people were talking about depends on the computer slot youre dealing with
it is superior in every way though to the kensington combination lock with the coiled cable which is what i bought before this one
that one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock
so if youre choosing between a kensington combination and a kensington key go with the key
your poor computer casing will thank youcons as others have mentioned its a little short
also im a bit concerned about the if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again
feature others have mentioned but ill deal with that when it happens if it does
key is a little bulky to carryi use this as part of a multitiered security system
of course a lock alone wont stop someone with a bolt cutter
im only hoping to slow down a casual snatch and grab thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or suchthis lock is very easy to use
the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself
tie your laptop up wherever you go especially the library
i live on the ground floor and my desk is right next to the window
so i keep my laptop locked up even when its at home so that any wouldbe burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook
although if he really wanted to he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cableall in all this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and i recommend it for all laptop userspurchased four of these locks for various computers around the house both portable and desktop types
took a little while to coordinate the latchholding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism offalignment so it will no longer insert properly
but once youve figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to completethe attached encased steel cable is thick and stout more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store tiedown security setups for instance
this should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks
its not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft but the wouldbe thief will now have to have a fairly heavyduty set of cutters in order to get through this cable
the lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itselfsolid product at a more than reasonable pricei bought this cord to deter people from waltzing off with my work laptop
it feels and looks good and sturdy and doesnt have any obvious glitches or defects so its doing there job well in that respect
it is a bit bulky which works for my work computer which is  thick at the hinge but it wouldnt be suitable for my newer ultrabookim using this lock with a relatively new hp pavilion laptop and it seems to be a very nice product for what its intended to do  protect your computer in reasonably secure areas
as others have said it wont stop a bolt cutter and it could probably be picked given enough time
but in an environment like an office or restaurant it should be finethe cable is flexible and nicely coated so that it doesnt scuff surfaces
the lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy and it hasnt scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses
the only real concern i see the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks ive used so if theres some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same timethe lock arrived early and did what it is suppose to do
it is easy to install and comes with a velcro strip to wrap up the cord when not in use
good overall productit wont stop somebody with the right cutting tool but deters random theft when attached
good productit works on my imac  but the directions didnt help
it would seem intuitive to just shove it in the computers rectangular hole made for the lock
it did though require a lot of fidgeting to get it inserted
i had to hold the barrel from spinning and insert the lock at the same timevery frustrating
but it is on nowi bought  of these this year  i guess out of habit
they seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot but maybe thats normal
it didnt keep me from buying  more of themas the picture shows you loop the lock through a stable object then lock it to the laptops security slot some notebooks wont have it i have an dell inspiron which has itif you leave your notebook computer unattended and there is no one around a determined thief could just break it off of the security slot attached to the computer
it doesnt feel too stable there
they would have damaged good however
this prevents my notebook from being walked away with when i am at the library
its worth paying  to protect a  toyit is not the best mouse but you get used to iti now buy nothing but kensington mice and trackballs
they are built well and have superior drivers
the orbit is a great entry level trackball i got for my sons mac mini
i use expert mice on my three macs  home  at work
the orbit gets  stars only because the kensington expert mouse is so much betteradd in a no questions asked  year warranty and you have no worriesmy only complaint about kensington
no bluetooth yeti think this is a good product if you plan to use it as intended
those that have incompatible graphics cards will run into serious problems but otherwise this is a great product that gets the job donei am very happy with the speakers they are great
they are not the loudest out there but its amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your handmy only complaint is that yamaha was offering a rebate when i bought these speakers and i sent in all  the nessecary stuff reciept rebate form and the upc from the box
then i  got a postcard from yamaha saying that they needed the upc
and since i  sent them the original i was out of lucki bought these speakers to complement my macintoshlinux machine
for my purposes watching dvds listening to mps and general fooling around they are perfect
the price is simply unreal for the quality these speakers  havelook elsewhere for speakers to replace your stereo however
these  are thirty watt speakers
you arent going to find punchy bass for the likes  of hiphop rap and other bassheavy musicthese speakers provide rich  clear sound at normal to loudish levels fills my house
i would give  them a  out of five stars but i wasnt able to
i wholly recommend these  to anyone who is looking for speakers for their computeri have this pieces set cost me  b rebate once i set up and play on my cd walkman first yes
this is a good set for the price deep no boomy bass clear mid and treble but somehow the midhigh sounds a little bit awfulthis set is much better than any peices set i had till i got jvc desktop stereosony woofer then i gave away and they says this speaker set sounds very goodas the author of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tent and a former radio discjockey that worked in several electronic stores i am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the s and steac ad combination cdcassette deckif you are looking for a very good unit that will play both cds and tapes this is a wise choiceteac has a strong reputation and quality for those that dont see the justification for spending more then  to there are a couple of terrific features included in this unit
the headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control
if you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side you can adjust the pitch for normal playbackthe entire ad is under twelve poundsas always try to use quality tapes such as maxell or tdk for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment
dirty heads will give the playback muddy resultsenjoy the music and be wellcraig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tenthard to find a cd  cassette deck combination in this day
seems to be the best price for the unitgreat if you need this to type of unit and still play your old cassettes
also useful if you want to transfer your cassettes to cds or dvdsnice controls a solid chassis easy to use remote
the standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playingno hiss or hum from the motors i mean if you put your ear up to the component itselfnot the lack of noise on the audio outputs which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player
the errorcorrection algorithms are excellenti played some badly scratched cds that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points
i would give it five stars but for two things  occasional speaker pop on powerup easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power ampreceiver on last when powering up your system and  limited programmingplayback optionsthere doesnt seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single cd straight through without creating a program containing all the tracks of that cd
the internal dac is not bad and of course the optical output lets you hook up your dac of choice
bottom line this is a great bargain in red book changers well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model what is jvc thinkingif you want a multicd changer driveplayer for your home separate component stereo system this is a good choice
mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities
it closely matches my older nonjvc rcvramp unit in size and looks
it is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money this is a good deal imhono

i mean some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one
often ill do a dry onethen follow it up with a wet one likemaxell vp vhs wet cleaneri wouldnt recommend a wet one followed by a dry one that might bind you all up orsomething
i hate it when my stuff gets all bound up and it requires being opened up bya professionali hope i have layedlaid put all the options on the table
buy these before they gothe way of of vcrsthank youit seems to work fine if youre having issues with your vcr playback and recording quality this is the answerthe tape video head cleaner works as expected
very good product
i recommend it for those who want to keep their old vhs equipmenti just cant fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well
i also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button probably doesnt clean the record heads is my guess however it is by far the simplest to use
even my mom could do it
thats got to be worth something
i think ill give it to my momi use both a wet and dry vhs head cleaner so this product goes well with the maxell wet head cleanerit sort of works
it worked in one vcr fine
i didnt seem to work in the other one
iffythere is no question that maxell has made the best of cleaners for your electronics
they have definitely done it for years with accessories and continue to do so
while many people have stopped owning vcrs there are some that still do after all these years and maxell is still making those aids for it
this maxell dry tape head cleaner handles very well and works in a instant
it is very easy to read and understand and should not die down
it will last around  times for use in your vcr and definitely is worth the money
while it can take a bit out of you if you do overuse it it should keep you vcr from any flaws for at least  years
i have always loved what maxell had made with their electronics accessories and this should definitely be a great buyprice bconvience  quality boverall b this is okay
but i prefer one that has a message that shows it is working
i still like to tape some shows and find it hard to find a cleaner that does have a message instead of just noise showingive been digitizing a lot of family movies videos etc and it is very important that the vhs player ive been using has clean heads
we manually cleaned the heads when we started but i purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process
the vhs player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear
i believe its doing what its supposed to doi purchased this for a friend and they absolutely loved it
based upon that i strongly support anyones decision to give this product a tryreceived the head cleaner on time
worked as expected although the actual cleaning time was less than  seconds as stated in the instructionsi purchased this for my dvdvcr converter combo
the product is working just fine
i havent had an opportunity to use it a lot but thats a good thing rightfor the cheap cheap price these speakers work as good as needed and sound decent
they do what they need to do and did i say they were cheapi bought these after reading reviews i dont think they sound as good as some said they didhowever i am satisfied with them for what i use them for background music on patiofor the money i didnt expect bose qualitydollar for dollar these are hard to beat 
every body was right about the brackets they are a little weakly made
mine are mounted inside our camper in the upper corners of the bedroom and sound much better than the old ceiling speakerswill buy another pair for the living area to replace the other pair of ceiling speakers out there
are a nice size for space avaiablefor a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants and lasted longer than i expectedthese are awesome
best  headphones ive ever heard and they cut out the dull roar of trainscarscomputerscoworkers almost entirely
i truly wonderful product and amazon had them in my hands in  hours
im just so so pleased ok the deal is that i was looking for earbud headphones that i could wear while riding my motorcycle long distance on the highway
most earbuds are useless because at high speed the wind noise drowns out everything
in fact wind noise is so bad that i normally have to wear earplugsenter the koss earbudsfirst the sound
great sound very accurate with excellent range
headphones arent worth it if the sound does not satisfythese more than satisfysecond the applicability to the taskthe earplugs supplied with the earbuds are darn good and will work for most applications
i decided that i wanted something even more custom so i cut up some of my normal motorcycleriding foam plugs and fitted them over the earphones
the result is excellent
even at  mph i get good sound with comfort and acceptable windnoise reductionif you want absolute noise isolation plus sound i recommend you get largesize soft foam earplugs
drill out a hollow shaft through the center
to do this heat up a quot drill bit force it through one end and then twist repeatedly to cut out a shaft
press the earplugs over the small tube on the earphone then apply the earplugs according to the instructions on the earplug package
purchasing notei was suspicious of the circuit city pickup option but tried it anyway
i was very pleased
circuit city confirmed the purchase within  minutes and i picked up the headphones the same eveningupon determining that the applebrand ear pods included with my ipod were of inferior quality i opted to have them replaced asap
i assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product and decided on the koss the plug or spark plug ear buds
my other option was the shure ec model as a friend owns these and they sound phenominal
however since i dont foresee myself using my ipod all that often i didnt up my budget to accommodate thesethese headphones are of the ear bud style which basically means that a foammalleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear as opposed to ear pods which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal
an important thing to know about ear budstyle headphones is that they will not perform at their maximum ability if not properly inserted
instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package and if not followed you will not get the best usage out of your product  in fact the sound quality very well may sound terribleto properly insert these ear buds the entire foam nub must be fully compressed via pinching and rolling with the fingers and immediately inserted into the ear canal
additionally your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting
the ear buds then must be held in place without shoving them in deeper for approximately  seconds while the foam expands into your ear canal forming a solid fit
if incorrectly inserted ie
not inserted all the way not compressing the foam prior to insertion etc
highs and lows will sound awful even if you own a pair of  ear buds yes they do exist
simply put if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well donewith that out of the way the sound output of these rather inexpensive koss ear buds is very impressive for the price
the frequency response ranges from  hz to  khz which is nothing to smirk at
distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point i suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums
the bass output is subtle and effective for the most part but doesnt perform very well with certain genres of music while almost all electronic music sounds amazing bassheavy rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction
it should also be known that there literally is no headphone inear or not that perfectly reproduces all styles of music and this applies to even the most expensive models
any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction while performing less impressively in others
can you tell im an audiophile yet
the few negativities to speak of are as follows
the cable while a decent length not too short not too long feels rather fragile
additionally the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side and may or may not cause some minor to severe  discomfort after extended periods of use upwards of an hour
thankfully replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics storesoverall if youre finding yourself in the same boat i was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing applebrand ipod ear pods but dont want to break the bank the koss the plug are highly recommended for the price
i havent heard any other inear ear buds in this price range but i can imagine that these are hard to beat for the moneyjust dont forget to properly insert them every time
once you get the hang of it they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within  seconds
if you dont insert them correctly they will not sound good at all and you will have wasted your money
im a smoker and even i hate wasting money
so educate yourself on inear headphones before buying any and you wont be disappointedi have tried almost every kind of headphone and somehow could never get ones to a stay in my ears b not hurt my ears c keep the quality of sound from my ipod
i purchased these headphones for myself to use at the gym so i can keep them in my ears and the plastic wont hurt me after a bit of use like most do and my husband took them and fell in love with them
he used them all the time and had them with him camping and sadly lost them in his camp fire so we purchased each of us a pair the second timethey do a nice job of isolatingthey block out tons of noise
they can be a tad noisy when you chewoverall im very pleased with the plug headphones and ive been using them daily for over a month nowi purchased these headphones to replace the stock ipod headphones
i use my ipod almost exclusively for listening to podcasts while i do my morning walk and while im driving to and from work
for that reason i didnt need high fidelitywhat i was looking for was a headphone that would block external noise and stay in my ear comfortably
good sound was important to me but im not that picky since i dont listen to a lot of music
heres how the plug fulfilled my criteria noise cancelling  stars
if you take the time to compress the foam by rolling the foam between your fingers and get it inserted correctly you get almost no external noise
it acts almost like a regular ear plug
stay in my ear  stars
again if you compress the foam and let it expand in the ear canal
if you dont it still stays in well but not nearly as well as it does when it is compressed and allowed to expand
comfort  and a half stars
the halfstar deduction is because the hard plastic part of the plug presses against a spot on my ear and causes just a little bit of a pressure point
everybodys ear is shaped different so your mileage may vary
i did try these with music and they do sound great
ive never had an expensive headphone so i cant give a comparison therei really liked everything about the stock ipod headphones for my use except the ear bud itself
the foam covers kept coming off and they didnt stay in my ear very well during my walk
the plug headphone does remedy those problemsim knocking off another halfstar because the plug headphones have a thin cord that gets tangled much easier than the apple headphones
this is probably common to any other aftermarket headphones thoughapparently i have nonstandard ears
normal buds will fall out easily
so i focused my research on intheear buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting
onto the prosconspros block outside sounds out well
you can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence
 the sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you
 produces a lot more sound output at the same volume
i attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears
does this benefit battery life since youre running reduced volume
id think so but probably not a noticable amount
 nice long cord
 seemingly good quality
 includes extra foamiescons you have to sick them into your ear
some people probably would hate this
 they can block virtually all outside noise
someone could be axe murdering my family while i listen to music with these things and id never hear it
seriously
 if the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit noise to your ears due to the fact the plugs are in your ear
this is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since i primarly use this with my shuffle in the gym
 i find the bass to be muddy
however this is the case with every earbud ive used
consider the price of these its a very minor complaintive tried a lot of earbud style headphones and have found these to be the most comfortable
a great value
sound quality is good and the design of the plugs helps filter out noise
i found these to be great on an airplane allowing me to relax to my music while filtering out engine noise conversations etc  highly recommendedupdate i still agree with everything i wrote in my original review but ive gone through few of these now
after  months one of the ear buds goes dead or becomes intermittent
the wire seems to be worn or fatigued over time due to use its a cheap item so maybe the price is still worth it but just know that it may not be a very durable pair of earbudsexcellent price for a non audiophile
for me sound is great and isolation is too
nice snug fit
they tend to wiggle a but lose when i run so i use a headband to help hold them in
this works because they are so small and the headband doesnt make it feel like a visei use these with my ipod nano while at the gym or doing yardwork
the closedin ear piece helps keep out the sound of the lawn mower or chatty gymrats on their cell phones
these also have the deepest bass of any other earbuds ive tried  too much for some but those that like rock or metal should dig ema couple things to note  a brand new set might have a few issues with falling out but once the cushions are broken in they stay in the ear with no problems
also the cushions occasionally soak up sweat and become soft and pinched in the ear
lastly they are almost alway gross after useit takes a while to get used to the pressure in the ear but i cant switch after getting used to thesethe only fault i could find with these is that the cord is too short
other than that theyre greatjust super sound coming form this small device
i use it when i travel on the airplane and discovered i dont need the bulky expensive noise canceling headphones
with the ear plugs nicely placed all you hear is great sound and its easy to carry around
definitely recommend itgood deal for the 
the foam earplugs fit much nicer especially if you have big old ear holes like i dothis is my rd pair and ive liked all of themfirst while im no audiophile and wont attempt to offer comments about the smooth deep bass or crisp highsyour results may varyi will say that im personally very pleased with the sound from these earbuds and find the isolation they offer is a real plus
in fact thats partly why i bought them  working sometimes in a very noisy environment that necessitates wearing hearing protectors i thought it would be nice if i could turn them into headphones and at least enjoy some music while working
ive never cared for earbuds that rest in your outer ear so prone to falling out
with the hearing protectors on over them it was still rather easy to tug the earbug out of position
quotthe plugquot stays quite well put thanks to the soft foam cushions
away from work the noise isolation of these stereophones continues to serve a great function especially when travelling on airplanes or in any noisy environmentit is the isolation offered by the ear cushions that surely attribute to their efficiency
even lowpowered headphone outputs on portable music players will likely still have all it needs to drive these plugs sufficiently for enjoyable listening
the drawback of the ear cushions is as others have said that they do mean you must be careful about how you position the plugs in your ears as that will affect overall sound quality
the bass is excellent yet can become quotboomyquot
that is why i say quotyour results may varyquot
but for anyone willing to spend some time getting familiar with quotthe plugquot i think they will be happy with the sound potential providednowabout the custom fit
yes they really do custom fit to your ear canal if you choose the appropriate size cushions from those included
however again as mentioned the provided cushions do not remain compressed very well while attempting to insert the plugs in your ears
moreover while the foam does seem to be the best ive experimented with in terms of comfort against the skin and general acoustic performance it doesnt hold up very well over time
so this led me to exploring for a substitute and learning in the process what a difference in sound the type of foam makesas i write this im wearing my plugs modified by replacing the koss foam cushions with some i made myself from aearo ear classic foam ear plugs
the beauty of this approach is that as the ear plugs are designed for hearing protection they do compress very well and hold their compressed shape longer making it easier to insert the plugs into your ear canal for a better and deeper fit
but therein lies the rubit is that more deep secure fit that affect sound quality
my observation is that the impact is primarily upon the bassmaking it even deeper and risking again a potential quotboomyquot quality
im pleased with the results i obtained from the aearo ear plugs after trimming them down in diameter so there wasnt quite so much foam to quotbulk upquot in my ear
while the aearo plugs work well and sound good ive found an even more comfortable and bettersounding i think alternative in using howard leight laser lite foam ear plugs
the latter have a noise reduction rating of  and are made of a softer smoothertextured foam than the aearos
i think the aearos have a similar nrr but they are not labeled with itnow how do you go about making your own ear cushion
the approach i took was to compress one end of the foam ear plug down until it was basically flattened squarely against the other end on a flat surface
then holding the quotpancakedquot plug in place i heated a large nail over a flame and then pierced the center of the ear plug with the tip of the nail pushing it gently through the foam so as not to tear the foam
rotating the nail tended to help
once the hole was pierced through the foam to the other end i lifted the foam off the surface and pushed the nail fully through this also serving to tug the foam along enough that it helped it to stretch back out along the nail shaft
once the nail cooled a bit i slid the plug off the nail and had a rather cleanly pierced ear plug that i could then slip onto quotthe plugquot
if the new ear cushion was too long or too thick to fit my ear well id trim it down gradually with sharp scissors
in the end i made up several pairs of cushions to interchange as i like
the aearo plugs were rather easy to modify since the foam is stiffer and thus easier to pierce with the hot nail
but with care the laser lite plugs could also be pierced without tearing the foam and they are smaller in diameter such that i found no need to trim them except in length
when the modified plugs are slipped over the sound delivery tube of quotthe plugquot earpieces ensure the tube does not get crimped and extends fully through the cushion so as to deliver the best quality soundthis may sound like a lot of work for such inexpensive headphones but they are greatsounding headphones for a small price and can be customized to your own liking with a similar approach to what i describewhen im not using quotthe plugquot i switch to my koss ktxpro titanium headphonesanother pair of excellent headphones that i dont think can be beat for the price
they too sound great and have very good efficiency at about the same price as quotthe plugquot
they are bettersuited for an office environment where you need an openair type earpiece to hear conversation through rather than being isolated
the volume control on the cord is also a real convenience and is the only thing i find missing from quotthe plugquoti kept seeing these on the rack in my local supermarket for  and finally gave in and bought them
i hate wearing fullsize headphones as i wear glasses and the ear pads always jam the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull and hurt me after a short while
these koss buds are very comfortablei also travel on airplanes quite a bit and dont want to fork out the big bucks for hissy noisecancellation so this seemed like a good compromise
these plugs seal out external noise quite wellthey are also reasonably efficient and have stacks of bass  sometimes i have to use the eq on my mp player to knock the bass down a bit
the top end is a little bit messy cymbals dont sound that clear but the overall performance is very good considering the pricevery lightweight
cable is very thinthey came with a set of about  replacement sponge ear plugsno builtin volume controlthe first time i bought the plug i thought the sound was tiny and weak and i immediately returned it
then i saw someone mentioned the purple vs
blue earlier version and i purchased it again making sure it was purple
sure enough the purple ones are great
like other koss headphones you not only hear the bass but you also feel it
its amazing that such big bass can come out of these tiny earplugs
i replaced the included foam plugs with regular plugs from a drugstore and they make an even better seali also have the etymotic eri which costs at least  times more than this one
when it comes to sound of course the eri have a much higher fidelity but much less bass but considering the price difference i think these koss earplugs have a greater value
overall the sound quality is just average but if you mostly listen to pop while on the road you probably wont mind or care that some notes are a little imbalanced and muddy
as far as sound isolation go after replacing the included foam plugs with the ones from the drugstore they are as good as the etymoticsbe sure to get the purple onesafter a month of use i am quite satisfied with my purchase
the foam inserts are far more comfortable than any other style i have worn
the sound quality exceeds standard headsets that generally come with mp players and walkman stereos
they are not audiophile caliber but considering the price they sound fine
i wear them while running and theyre sweatproof so far  and unaffected by any stethoscope effect that other reviewers have noted about sony earphones
i can also adjust how deep i place the plug in my ear canal enabling me to hear the environmental sounds sirenshornsetc
that affect my saftey when running in public placesits too early to comment on durability but i do treat them carefully as i would any lightweightportable headphonesan excellent buy at under this product is a great value
when coupled with the  pair trilevel  earphones plus brand replacement ear cushions made to fit klipsch shure etymotic and other models requiring a mm attachment diameter
clear large it makes these ear buds on par with higher cost phonesi find these ear buds to be very comfortable decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound
one downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic strawlike tube if youre opening your mouth ie
eating yawning the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled but this is only temporaryi can confirm that this model here does not have the volume control inline thankfullyeditafter owning these for several months i put a pair through the wash  they still worked but the foam died
i bought another pair and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the priceedit after ordering a second pair and using them for a bit they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat etc
therefore i am off to buy my rd set
for such a low price i really could care lessim giving a  star review for these earphones with a couple big caveats
ive owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of koss sportapros that have served me well they sound good not as good as the portapros but still good and were pretty cheap
but they leak sound terribly meaning theyre not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work and also are not that convenient to carry around
when i recently bought an ipod and finally got to try out some inear headphones i loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use but i never could get the stock ipod headphones to fit my ear
they didnt sound particularly good either
so i knew i wanted to try something elsei first bought a pair of sennheiser mxs and while i actually liked their sound a lot better than the stock ipod phones they didnt fit my ears any better
theyd fall out even if i so much as turned my head to one side
one of my coworkers then recommended the plug and at such a low price i figured id give them a shotive now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed but i do feel these earphones are a pretty good value
most importantly to me is that so far theyre the only inear headphones ive found that dont seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place
i do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions  i apparently have very large ear canals  but they seem fairly secure though not tight once theyre in there
some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable  you really have to place them well up into your ear canals make sure you clean your ears well every day
 but i find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you dont have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your earsoundwise id say theyre fine though certainly not remarkable
my mxs sound better and my sportapros sound a lot better
id put these about on par with the included ipod headphones
theyre pretty bass and midrange heavy though like other inear headphones the bass isnt really very bassy  it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce
it ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced and theres a lot of this fake bass
on the high end theres a lack of clarity  things like cymbal crashes sound muddy and ragged
this is typical of lowend headphones of any typestill id rate the sound good enough considering the application most people will use these for portable listening and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs more conventionallydesigned inear headphonesi was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones and the koss brand name convinced me to give them a tryi compared them to the sennheiser hd headphones that i normally use for portables and my akg df headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albumsthe koss the plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity
this means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps such as those found in multipurpose portables like pdas and portable synths like the yamaha qy series
they also have excellent bass which together with the dynamic range makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance musicunlike another reviewer i did not find any problem with the midrange or high end
i suspect that this perception some people have had is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted  especially in headphonesas others have mentioned the fit is critical to the sound quality
read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging
even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound
experiment a little until you find the best soundwarning  these headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps mp and cd players
famous musicians like pete townsend and jeff baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music  so be carefultwo of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears always being too big for them
they love koss the plug inear headphones because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel fitting snug
the only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them so they will need to be cleanedthese have very good bass although they dont sound as good as my sennheiser cx
the price is cheap so i mainly use it when im on the streets so if someone steals it i wouldnt get very angrynote the description i saw on the amazon page does not reflect the product i have
above it discusses a headband and an adapter which are not part of this product
also the rated frequency response is k not k
i think this is or was an amazon editorial errormy interest for this product is as a solution to listening to music lectures and movies while travelling and i travel a lot
i have a set of panosonic noisecancelling headphones which were good about five times more expensive than these earbuds though bulky but the plastic broke so they wont stay on my head nowthese earbuds are an excellent alternative to noisecancelling headphones for the frequent traveller
i find them more comfortable for extended listening than most conventional headphones
the ability to seal out noise from the external environment is very good and makes it possible to understand what actors are saying when watching a movie on an airplanethe overall performance  sound quality and noise blocking  is not as good as the bose noise cancelling headphones but the bose are  times as expensive much less convenient to carry and subject to damage from the rough world of the road warrior
if the plug had an optional noisecancelling unit say combined with the eq it would be a killer combination  are you listening koss
the sound is good
bassheavy to be sure i would like them better if they had a flatter response but the product is marketed at the portable music crowd and many of them are looking for dramatic bass rather than goldenears soundbesides mobile sound is always a compromise its just a question of whether the compromise they chose works for youhere are some problems ive heard and the solutions
they fall out of my ear
i think an older version of this product did not come with alternative cushions the ones i bought recently as pictured here came with  alternative cushion pairs one of which fit well in my somewhat large ears
to make them fit well roll the cushions in your fingers and squeeze them down then hold them in place in your ears while they adjust the fit
also it is possible to fashion your own cushions easy modification to commercially available ear plugs from pharmacy go to google and search for koss plug mods what about when i have to replace the cushions theyll get waxydirty with use
see last sentence of 
they sound tinny
i have a sense that the sound was tinnier on an earlier version of these earbuds judging from comments ive read in feedback and on the koss plug mods page
the purple plugs as opposed to the older
blue ones do not sound tinny to me they seem a bit heavy on the bass instead
koss also makes a band eq  dollars for their headphones that can be used to adjust the sound some
i have an eq on order hoping it may temper the boomy bass a bit
of course your player may have a way of changing the color of the sound but my laptop does not
theyre easy to lose
the price of their tiny size and negligible weight is that you need to be careful not to lose them
ive already lost a pair
koss also makes a carrying case which may help or you could just put them in a mm film canister
but at  a pair compared to  for noisecancelling headphones ill just keep a spare pair around in my travelling caseoverall im pleased with the priceperformance tradeoff for these earbuds and they are an essential part of my travelling kit
they sound better than any other earbuds ive used and they remove a good bit of the ambient sound offering more pleasure in listening
i give four stars out of five because id prefer a less bassy sound though some people will really like the way they soundokay the price of these has gone up since the last time i bought some ive given a lot of these to friends im wacky about them but not by much
as was mentioned they do crap out ive had one that quit working and another that broke while i was treating it very roughly
anyway i think that these are ideal if your player has an eq on it
these contrary to what another poster has mentioned are very bassy
ive found that by plugging just about half of the little holes on the back attenuates the bass if an eq isnt an option
they block sound quite well better than any other nonactive nr headphones ive usedthe weakness in my experience has been treble i use the eq to boost the treble and drop the bass and these sound spectacular i have to do the opposite for my grado headphones
i dont think that you could find anything better for this price and ive tried
the other nice thing is that if they do break or get lost its no big deal
pair these with a cheap gb sandisk player the cheap sandisks that ive used have eqs and you have a nice lowrisk investment for the gym or anywhere else where they might be damagedas for the poor bass comment they are tricky to get seated at first
poorly seated plugs will sound tinny and weakgive them a shot
not much to lose herei bought the plug after reading all kinds of reviews for it and similar products
it really is a nice stereophone for the money
the sound quality is very good and i have not noticed that it has too much bass as several other reviews said
the earplug like ear pieces are pretty comfortable i wear mine up to  hours a day and provide moderate sound insulation
i would estimate they cut noise db comparing them to the performance of earplugs rated at db
the only concern i have is that they are a little bit flimsy
i wear them every day at work in machine shop so the sound dampening is essential and enables me to listen to music except when using the noisiest machinesa great buy for the moneyi use sony s in the gym and they are a nice earbud phone but ive had them for awhile and wanted to try something else
i read some reviews and ordered these
first off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs
you squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand
they must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear
if you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass
if you like exaggerated heavy bass these are for you
as for the guy who said buy a dozen or half dozen and thank him later idont think that thats necessary
they are very nice sounding for the price and work good in the gym for me
if your mp player has an eq you can select a curve that makes them sound more realistic
hope that helpsthe ear cushions that come with this product are terrible
i used an awl to make a hole in the earplug and then cutoff a bit off the top of the earplug
i cut it off a bit too muchjust cut it off a littlethe sound from this product is great for an earbud style headphoneto increase isolation i use a hearing protector ear muff on top of the plug and i really cant hear anything after doing itthe main point buy foam earlugs and these things will be a lot more comfortable and will let you enjoy your music more by eliminating background noisei have owned two pairs of these earphones and i love them
noise cancelling wannabes by me saying this i am applauding koss for the price to quality ratio
you could spend  for a noise cancelling pair of headphones but i find that these headphones do equally good of a job i have a pair of creative noise cancelling headphones and i prefer the koss plug
wmodificationif you replace the provided foam plugs with regular foam ear plugs you will get a much better fit
do this by triming a regular pair of foam ear plugs to the length of he canal on the plug
then drill a hole through the center using a small drill bit or use a needle and work around to make the hole bigger
this process is tedious i will admit but having a clean pair negates the con listed below that fits better than the provided foam plugs is well worth it
you will also find that the replacement plugs will stay compressed longer making it easier to insert into your earconsthe rubber canal that channels sound to your ear can fall off easily if lose that its all over this is why i gave it  stars instead of 
build up of ear wax on the plugs no matter how well u clean ur ears you will get some dirt build up on these things replace the plugs every few months using modification aboveprosprice deep bass even wo super bass systems noise cancelling ability w modification listed abovegreatly enhance deep bass perception
very comfortable fit
balanced sound
come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs
potential problems not too good with treble highs
i recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum band equalizer or if youre not a treble fanatic
also the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long but thats just speculation on my part since ive only had them for a few days
finally it insulates from all ambient sounds so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important then you should consider another designfor me these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm
a good seal is essential for achieving strong bass
they are rated a little more efficient the db rating than many of the others and this was noticeableive used many low cost earbuds and there are a lot of decent ones out there
the really cheap ones are usually just that cheap
i find the  to  range offer among the best qualities someone may be looking for in decent good sounding earbuds
most are good having varied degrees of what predominant type of sound you may be listening forthese koss earbuds offer a very good bass range with overall good sound and volume
the mids and highs are not as crisp but usually can be adjusted well enough for good tonethese buds are mostly for strong bassthe fit of these earbuds is one of the most comfortable with nice cushy foam inserts that stay in your ear well and really eliminate most outside noise
in turn they also provide a very discreet listening experience
i find the best way to insert these buds is to give them a little squeeze and stick them in my ear and let the foam expand in my earoverall the build quality of these earbuds appears to be quite good with minimal wire to bud noise transferthese earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good
bass response wasnt that great but what do you want for the pricethere are more expensive ear plugs but these work very well
i use them when i jog and while on the motorcyclethis is my rd pair in about  years
i wear them practically every other day  exercising or working in the yard
these are actually better than the previous ones from the same manufacturer that i bought at a brick and mortar
those had a very annoying mute button on the cord
these do not
compared to other ear plugs or in the ear headphones that i have i can use these when i run or bike in the summer without them falling out
ive paid over  for others that didnt work half as welldefinitely not highquality but good enough for the average person
at such a low price i have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs so we have a total of  sets in the house
if you want audiophile quality youll need to pay a lot more but at less than  these deliver decent sound and i dont get sick every time i step on one or break a wire
for sound id rate them  stars for durability id give them  stars and price is a i like how the foam plugs conform to your ear but if you want them in tight  like for running  and you dont get them wedged in just right the foam will squeeze shut and block the soundi like these they sound good are priced reasonable block out all other sound
my only complaint is that i cant find the soft replacement ear buds
i have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder  are not as easy to roll
think i will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft onesjust as expectedand when you need a volume control down only in a mm format this one works fine
it is not an amp just a volume controlthe volume controller is reasonably well designed no crackling drop out of volume or other distortion during use
its ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand
the connecting cord is to short and the quality of the wire feels cheap
this product was a recent purchase so i can not comment on longevitythis is a lifesaver for using headphones with my dell d laptop which boasts an extremely noisy headphone jack with lots of interference at low volumes
using this volume control i can turn up the volume on the dell to overpower the static while keeping the volume of the music in my ears lowthe control is even less sexy than the picture on the website if thats possible
it also doesnt work great for an extremely loud source like my dell port replicators line out port because the sound from the volume control doesnt seem to be output equally in both ears at low levelsi have had four different volumen controls
two on the earplugs and two on a seperate controls like the koss vc
this is deffinately the easiest access volume control i have used
you do not have to search to find the volume control
it is a simple roll knob that is easy to find
note that if you care this is not an l shaped plug as shown in the product image
i might mention i am not that concerned about high quality
i only use the mine to listen to audio books which this seems to be fine for so far
but will get some tough use
i broke the last two earphones quite expensive onesat the plug and decided breaking a volume control would be cheaper
i broke that as well
i thought i would try an l plug connection
i failed to notice the photo of the notes from deepanker at the top which shows this is a straight line plug
i will see how this one goeskoss vc volume controli purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and i to use with our laptop
the koss volume control does exactly what its supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily
i didnt notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged inline with the headphones
if you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit
my wife absolutely loves the convenience but ive concluded i could just as easily live without itshould you buy it
just answer three questions and youll have your final answer
 would you prefer a little extra cord length
 in everyday headphone use do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume
 do you have the extra cash to burnmy wife answered yes to all three while i answered no
did we keep it
you know what they say happy wife happy lifei would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels but if you need a simple volume control than this is the onethis is a perfect companion piece for my f lineout dock and bluetooth transmitterreceiver for my ipod
allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the setup
clip on back allows me to keep it handymy only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel
it could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing playi typically have my ipod in a leather case tucked in my pocket and i dont want to have to dig it out when i want to adjust the volume
this device is a practical  inexpensive solution to that functioni would like the volume wheel to be bigger or stick out more so it would be easier to use
the plug is straight not l shaped as shown in the current picture
the cord is  inches
i use this with my mp player because im trying to minimize wear and tear on my old player and i dont like my panasonic headphone volume control slider thing
i didnt want the thin metal pocketbelt clip but fortunately i was able to pull it off with some thin pliersi initially used the koss volume control inline with headphones in order to listen to the tv late at night without disturbing others
we have a  speaker system controlled by one speaker volume knob no remote control
its wired from the tv to a  yduplex plug one line continues to the speakers the other goes to the headphones
turn the speakers down all the way and you only hear it through the headphones
ok so farbut guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway with the headphones plugged in and you change the volume on the headphone using the koss volume control
the volume of the external speakers changes
huh
how is that possible
it was odd at first but if you lowered the koss units volume the speakers volume went up
raise the koss volume the speakers volume went down
its something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the  speakers
i had to add a label loud and soft mounted just the opposite of the lowtohigh volume legend near the control wheel since it controlled the speakers opposite of what youd thinkso the koss volume control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers
who knewps
i like it so much im buying anotherperforms as advertised
some people have noted a drop in audio quality but to a person with average ears such as mine your audio should sound almost exactly the same
the price is definitely fairthe one problem ive encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side so i have to use my fingernail to turn it
but its only a minor annoyance since the product worksit was bought in case i had issues hearing from a pair of earbuds that i bought and it works greatthis product is great
when my wife  i both want to share a wired connection to an audio source i dont have to have her continually telling me to turn it downits too loud
i bought this for her to turn hers down while i enjoy it at a level i can hear
too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection
sometimes its not always convenient to used hearing protection
they didnt have those hightech earplugs back in the day and a lot of us older babyboomers have lost significant hearing as a resulti use headphones at night to watch tv and this helps because i can clip it to my pjs  adjust the sound level on our me tv channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice  the wheel that makes the adjustment is very touchy takes some practice to get used to it so it lost a star because of that it does what you would think it would nothing more and or lessas far as i can hear i used a pair of audio technica athms plugged into a focusrite scarlett i studio quality setup there is no loss in sound qualityi initially just needed an extension to prevent exerting too much tension on a heavy headphone cable
however i figured being able to adjust the volume with an analog control would be a nice bonus
and it isit does its job and at that it does it simply and wonderfully
edit after a while of use i noticed that it subdues the highs lows and even at the highest volume it is slightly quieter than without it
still a good buy thoughgood quality no impact on audio qualitythe wheel is small and recessed
maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket etc
but it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if youre gonna stick it in your pocket
anyway the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvementsimple inline volume control
works as its supposed too which is all we can ask
no issues with it at this timei bought this and used it for a few weeks before it just died
no reason no drops or bumps
it just quit working
i requested a replacement because i really liked it while it worked
the returns process was quite easy and i didnt have to pay to ship it back
overall still a positive experiencebought this because my earphones had no inline volume
it does what is says it will
my one complaint was that is can only decrease the volume not increase itfor my use its perfect
i just have my speaker set to the max volume because its broken and i control my volume with this i love it although that shipping thing threw me off
   would have liked to know from the start thank you very muchthis product does what it is supposed to do
ive occasionally noticed that the connection isnt perfect but mines been banged around a lot and dragged on the floor of my study
ive always been able to get rid of any connection problems by just ensuring that the my phones are plugged in tight
this product comes in handyits a good unit and does what its supposed to do but the sound passing through loses some quality
seems slightly distorted or missing some of the sound rangesdoes a good job at attenuating the sound out of my phone
my android has a bug where the media volume resets to max anytime a notification sounds
this lets me set the media to max and then turn it down to comfortable
i have very good earphones and havent noticed any sound issues
the cord is flimsy feeling and quite long so ive just kept it tied in a bundle
well have to see about its longevitythe sound is perfectly fine
i couldnt tell any difference in quality when i had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster
the cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse
i wish it was strongeri was hoping to get more volume from my tablet with an auxillary conrol but that was not the case
but still a good product for extending the length of your speakersi purchased this to hook up to my headphones that do not have a line level control
for its purpose it is finei am not an audiophile so i cannot comment on how good or bad the sound is
seems fine to me but i have bad hearing anyway
the one i got did not have a curved jack as pictured but rather a straight one no problem
i use this on my laptop and i have noticed that if i want to reach the louder setting i first have to turn my laptop up to one of the higher settings and then i can go up or down with the koss
overall i think it was a good purchasei got this because when we are recording music i dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time freddy p wants it super loud in his ear
this way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want
great deali am using this volume control to operate the volume from a  satellite radio to one of the popular mini mini speakers being sold which do not have volume controls
works just finei use it at work where i use inear earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me
very usefulnot sturdy but has lasted a year so far without problems
even the cheapie inline volume control has not created any noise problems
the price is right and this extension can be used with any headset
i think koss will replace the cord free if it goes badmade listening on the head phones much more comfortable and convenientit is a good addition to the purchase of head phonesdid most of what i wanted gave me easy to access volume control while i was snowboarding
on the other hand as soon as i took a tumble the tiny fragile little metal clip bent way out of shape
a good thick one wouldnt have done that
im knocking off a star for that since this isnt completely ideal for someone using this for a sports purpose
aside from that it does work pretty welli use this to ad a volume control to my headphones for my computer
it works
what more can i sayi have a number of headphones that for some reason have no inline volume control
of course i can always dig my ipod out of my pocket or backpack but its not always easy like this device which clips to pocket of beltnow i move this minimally priced addon from headset to headset and wear the pair most comfortable for the situationvolume control dial is a little small
probably makes so it doesnt adjust in you pocket however if you have large hands this may be difficult to adjust
worked as expected at  i thought it was a little overpriced
however now i am able to control my audio volume from tv to my headseti use my new koss remote volume control on my desktop computer in line with my powered speakersremanufactured harman kardon hk  computer speakerswhen im at the computer i always have it playing something  streaming music news national petroleum radio whatever
and the computer has a dozen virtual volume controls  winamp has a few volume controls windows has even a few more for adjusting the volume
why should i add the kossprosbut nothing compares in convenience to being able to reach out to a physical volume knob laying on the desk
no mousing required
faster than a mouse or keyboard controlin fact my keyboard has a dedicated volume control on it which i used to be impressed by
but it works through windows so sometimes its action is delayed after i hit it and then it starts moving at some arbitrary speed when i hold the button down
so its a minor challenge to make quick delicate adjustmentsthe tiny knob in the koss has a silky feel to it
ill let you know in a few decades if the physical control ever gets dirty and scratchyat the loud end of its adjustment range the control is very gentle and smooth
so if you turn the koss to maximum volume and adjust all your virtual volume controls so the audio is just a bit loud then its easy to use the koss to cut back the volume slightly and make very delicate adjustments around the desired volume setting
of course the koss can also reduce the volume to zero smoothlyamazon published another review the koss most critical review where the reviewer observed that the audio got muddy when the volume control was turned down to its lowest settings
i wouldnt use it at the lowest settings anyway because else youre going to blow your ears off if you turn the koss up towards the high end of its adjustment range
anyway it seems clear to me that the other reviewer tried compensating for the koss being turned to the low end by turning up other volume controls in his system so that he could hear the audio and one of those other volume controls was causing distortion
ie it wasnt the koss at fault for causing the muddiness and his outof star review is erroneous
i can confirm that there is no fidelity change when the control is turned towards its low endconstheres a clip on the koss so you can attach it to your shirt or shortsleeve and use it while you walk your mp and your dog
the wire is plenty long enough for that my wire is about   feet long but if your desktop computer isnt located on your desktop the wire might not be long enough for you to reach the volume control  not unless you add an audio extension cable
and you know adding more audio plugs and sockets threatens to make more scratchy connectionsthe wire itself is thin
were talking the type of wire that has a few wisps of copper for the audio a few more wisps for the ground all inside a  inch diameter plastic sheath
if i treat it gently it will last a while on my desktop
if i were to take it jogging and toss it around thoughtlessly it wouldnt last a year
thinking of opening up the housing which is glued shut and resoldering the connection
those wisps of copper and their tiny connections are very difficult to work with good luckanother reviewer mentions that he buys one of these periodically
he blames himself because the wire breaks periodically
i think some blame should be reserved for the delicate design of a product whose function it is to be used on the runi just needed an extension cable for my sony headphones that had very short wire length they connect to my cell phones hands free cable and thats why they have been made that way but most of the extensions available are at least ft in length
this koss vc was perfect and i also got the added convenience of a volume control
however at  what i paid at the time they are pricey for what they do
these days you can pretty much buy a cassettecd walkman for that pricenevertheless i am happy with my purchasei have had them before
so i knew what i was getting
it is hard to find these at walmart or even better radio shackthe volume control works as described and is well made
the only complaint i have is with the long cord
if you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy
otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wireif you use any sort of earphones or earbuds and you need to extend the length of the cord and at the same time also control the volume this little device is something you can use
a true audiophile might have some issue with it but for general use this works like a charm
i use one between my computer and my headphones and it sounds great on games and music alike
i also use one between my earbuds and mp player again i cannot complain
very cost effective and hard to find something better
note this will not amplify the sound beyond the volume of the source but can control it within the range of the signal being sentbought this for my brother to use on his motorcycle speaker system and it works really good
for this price you cant go wrong with thistrivial setup just put it between your headphones and whatever they were plugged into already
works although i agree with others who have mentioned that the thumbwheel is pretty smallthis online volume control works good no issues so far
i recommend it for anyone that owns headphones lacking volume controldoes what it is supposed to do
only criticism is the volume control knob is a little smalli needed this to adjust the volume while snowboarding and wasnt able to remove my gloves while on the mountain to mess with the ipod and this did the trick
its also good as an cord extension
no reduction in sound quality and it definitely took in some snow but still performs just finethis is a great companion to my jvc noise cancelling headphones
i dont really need the extra length while traveling but at home the added range and direct volume control is a big plusi used this for my father so he could control his pillow speaker control which has no volume control
its been working perfectly for about a year nowi like it but it has a  foot cord
add that to the  foot cord from my headset and i am dragging around  foot of cord
i have quit using it because i catch it on so many things
i will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset
it would have been nice if the cord was removable
i dont really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my jvc headset is turning out to be a challengemy niece who lives with me loves to play video games but we have wood floor throughout the house
this causes the noise from the video games to echo throughout the house
so i bought a rca to  mm cable and hooked up headphones not realizing that i needed something to control the volume with
this is where this koss vc volume control comes into play it worked wonders for my tv which is older and did have the rca audio outone thing to note is most of the modern tv do not have an rca audio out instead they have digital optical audio toslink output
this means you would have to get an adapter that takes the signal from analog to digital and backthis is yet another case of the product delivered being somewhat different than the product image which is not agreeable in principle of making an online purchase
the product i reviews has a slightly different casing that the image and also the wording is not white but grey
my problem is that in this case i feel with this image the seller is trying to give a somewhat skewed image on the devicefor one the mm male connectiongoing into your device that is producing sound is not a right angle connector
this can be a issue for some users since depending on their intended usage a straight connection can cause undue torquing on the mm port potentially causing damage to either the connector or the jack on the device itself
to balance this somewhat the mm cable is flexible and the jack is fairly small in comparison to some straight jacks that are larger and stick out quite farsecondly the metal clip that is supposed to attach the device to a shirt pocket ect
which is not shown in the product image is really cheap so does not hold fast to whatever you try to clip it onlastly the volume control it recessed into the chassis so it only protrudes slightly
this can be taken as a positive or a negative depending on your perspective
on the positive you will not have any issue with the volume control breaking or the volume being altered unintentionally
however because of this altering the volume can take slightly more deliberate effort than usual
it also means that it might be uncomfortable for those of you with larger fingers
this again has to do with your preference and how you change the volumeeither with the tip of your finger close to the nail or with the flat of the tip of your finger
overall i would have preferred the item been closer to  than the  it costs but i was in a hurrywhich i rarely ever am when it comes to electronics
so keep what i said in mind and look around for something that might fit you better before deciding
that is unless you were like me and just need an inline volume controller quickly and without hassleadditioni noticed this a while ago buy forgot to add it to my review when changing the volume the sound to the headphonesor whatever device is connectedis changed so that the volume in one ear becomes louder than the other
it happens when the volume is only changed slightly so only another minor move is required to bring the sound back to normal but it is noticeablemy portable xm radio was over driving the amp in my truck no matter how i adjusted it
installed this product in line with the radio output and problem solved and for almost nothingportapro headphones did not dissapoint
sound was good and a good alternative to in ear headphonesthese headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day i bought them
they are small light and deliver surprisingly good sound for the sizeon the negative size the foam ear pads can fall off very easily and have a relatively short life
the sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touchi purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub dollar onear phones
like many other reviews say the sound quality is superb for the price range
my only complaint is the comfort
i dont wear them on a daily basis and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to
other than that this is a top notch productgood product for the cost
good sound quality folds easily and can be used a variety of settings
nice priceyou cant beat the sound quality for this price
its good allaround for every type of music
clean high and solid low
if you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important you might want to check out other makes
i listen to all types of music so this is a good allaround headset for this purposeit does look a little dorky but sound quality is more important to me than looks
the headband does pinch your hair occasionally if youre not careful adjusting it
mine did not come with a case
it came with a soft pouch instead so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes
even in the folding position its not easy to get it in the pouch
the sound does leak enough to bother my wife as shes lying next to me in bed
the ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use
dont know if you can buy the foam separately
i gave it  stars mainly for sound quality and price 
ive had mine for about  years now and they still sound just as good as the various  plus headsets i recently listened to at the local best buy storegreat audio with the headphones nothing else needs to be said about thatbut now that thats said these headphones can be uncomfortable on larger melons
i find myself pulling them off and switching to my over the ear koss headphones because they dont feel like theyre crushing my skullalso the cord is by far the worst part about his set
the cable itself is a little too short for my tastes about  feet
this means i feel tethered to my laptop often
but more importantly is the quality of the cord
the cord itself feels like a wire stuck in a narrow sheet of plastic
the reason that is important is because the wire holds its shape any time its folded or bent
this means that the pretty cool looking pair of headphones now have a cord is sometimes so bent out of shape that it rides up in my facethese headphones are really great unfortunately mine broke early on
the return policy calls for you to ship the items back to koss   shipping and handling
i stood up and literally tore the cables out
in my own defense theyre not secured in tightly
i still give the headphones four stars because i believe theyre stylish and the sound is really great
they really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want soundisolation and they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channelsi liked these headphones pretty much what i paid for
the metal band on the top grabs hair sometimes if you adjust it on your head so just dont do that and youll be goodgood sound fairly comfortable
essentially just what i wantedfollowup comment june  i ended up sending one of the broken headsets back to koss along with a  check
turns out these have a lifetime guarantee and for  they will repair or replace them for you
i got the new pair in rapid order total turnaround was about  days
cautionif you send these in for repair do not include the pouch  they returned only the headphones without the pouch
anyway it was really nice having the new headphones
but this morning i picked them up to put into the little carry pouch i use for my nano and headphones and found that the left earpiece was dangling again broken at the swivel pointi really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that i dont have to crank up the volume to hear
but i am now actively looking for a replacement to use as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work
sorry to have to do this but i would change my  stars down to  but amazon is not letting that happenif you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table then these are great
if you plan to fold and open a lot i now suggest you look for something more durablesorry kossorigianal review jan  quality good enough to make me get  a rd pairi have gone through  pairs of these things now my current pair is nearly ready for replacement
the first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it i had had those about  or  years  i took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging
my second pair is now only  years old purchased april  and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy
if the wire moves sometimes the phones go into single ear mode so i guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint
this plug has a right angle into the player and it is right at the cord end of  the right angle piece where the wire is weakening
i am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving and see if that solves the problem temporarilyi do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals
i ask them to put the volume where it wont blow out my eardrums then i listen using their phones and settings
i then plug in my portapros and listen
so far i have not found anyones setup to beat  the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones
usually i have to turn the player down when i plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than othersif you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every  years or so then these are definitely a good deali just wish koss would send a hard case for storage since i do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed
koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug
when i get a new pair i will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem  less than  years is too soon for this to happenbecasue of these two design flaws i rate these a  intead of the  that the quality of sound deliversi listen to jazz smooth jazz pop rock and audiobooks primarilyhappy listeningamazon just reminded me that i purchased these from amazon in these portapros used to be the standard as the most comfortable and best sounding headphones for portable pc and casual listening
you cant go wrong at the price pointon my cowon iaudio u player much better audio watts than any crapple ipus where one can really hear the quality of audio
it has several audio formats that include the superior open source formats like the losless flac and the best lossy format oggi listen to different types of music classical classic rock blues progressive  audio documentaries audio booksi am one that really loves to listen to music that is distortion free as possible
i love clear clean sounds that are natural where you can really pick out all instruments little nuances in harmonies
where quietness silence in a song will be totally quieti have that as good as the portapros are they give more of a distorted sound especially with distortion at bass
i say this in compariason to sennheiser headphones and what i see as the best of breed the sennheiser pxssomeone called them livier than the pxs where i totally understand what they are referring too
the livier part is why i gave them to me son
that is distortion especially at bass
i dont like distortion or over amplification that creates distortionbut if one prefers that heavier distorted bass sound which many do these are the onesthey are sooo comfortable but then again so are the pxsi for one couldnt care less what others think if they look cool ugly whatever
what is essential is the comfort and audio qualityif someone is really bothered because they are not in a style that is not currently marketed then i feel the issue is withe the individual not the headphonesthey really are great and i see at  a great buyor  if you want you can pay of  and get some heavily marketed headphones that are more stylist but will be a more more uncomfortable and probably not sound as good as the portapros or the pxsi also will tell you that i cannot stand the headphones that are made to drown out sound
for one the headphones that do allow air sound better
the headphones that totally cut out air and environmental sounds literally  give me a headachei too want to know if someone is trying to get my attention or if their is some kind of loud noise that i should be aware ofjonas for me i have my portapros to my son several years agoi love a listen to music that gives me the most distortionlessthe koss portapro looks delicate but its folding design belies a hardiness that competitors should try to emulate
all headphones require a burnin period before they sound their best and thats certainly true of the koss portaproafter burnin they show themselves to be equal to their reputation
retailing between  and  or so they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume but grate a bit when pushed too hard
the portapro works nicely with a variety of musical styles pop and rock to jazz but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk this may not be a problem with most listenerswhile the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity songs often lack color  a common complaint with less expensive headphones
yet compared to its competition the portapro offers a much cleaner sound no irritating bass thump on these phonesthese are the ipod phones of choiceafter doing a bit of research this headphone was recommended as the best portable headphone in the price range which i mostly agree withthe goodgreat sound quality
bass booms and highs sound clearmuch more comfortable than incanal buds this may be more of a personal choicestylish but not too garishthe badmy hair gets caught in the adjustable band sometimesfeels little bit loose on my head even when its securealso this is more of a peeve but the included carrying case is really just terrible
its very hard to fit the headphones in there even when they are folded as small as they can possibly be
you can tell koss really cheaped out on the material for the bag its just too smallthats about it really honest headphones cheap and the sound is quite balanced
headband pressure adjustable firm  light
i find the firm a bit too tight but its a good setting when being active
totally recommendprosexcellent sound qualityreasonably durableconsfitstylelet me explain a little about the cons very ugly headphones provided with some temple dampening system that does absolutely nothing
the metal band comes in a very unnatural round bend that make the temple pads barely touch my cranium so they leave me wondering whos oblong head might this design fit perfectly
i have been pondering bending the metal to fit me more properly but i really dont like the idea
the headphones metal bands will pull your hairs and also note if you like loud bass you might want to look elsewhere
there might be a better headset for your portable music needs but i have yet to find something above the sound quality of my porta prosit works the sound really come out from the phones
just not as good sounds as i thought or maybe i just played crappy music with lousy mp quality downloaded from unreliable source
i confusedbut the good thing is i can bring it to airplane and dont have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines
yeayits not as pretty as it look from the picture though i think that beats by drdre look more sturdier than thisi bought these because they looked kooky
they sound good and theyre foldable but theyre not as comfy as i imagined
they hurt after an hour or soso headphones break on me all the time
i go through at least a pair every year
i guess i dont treat them amazingly and i like having music on me at all times so they get worn out fast
i realized awhile back i can go two ways on my next pair cheap and easily replaceable or expensive and higher quality hopefully lasting longer
i tried the latter a couple times since im a bit of an audiophile but this time i was sick of the joint at the jack breaking which is how pretty much every pair ive ever owned has broken cant wait for the day of cheap good sound quality wireless
then on cnet i saw the koss portapro listed as the best bargain headphones and i thought hell why not my last pair were  and they only lasted six months
got these and id say its probably the best dollar to quality value money can buy
the sound is rich and full especially in the base department
when i first started using them the treble sounded a little muffled but after a break in period i stopped noticing
i listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music as well as alternativeindie rock and these cans are perfect for it
because theyre over here youre not going to get great isolation but its good enough
loud traffic might leak in a bit and a good bit of sound leaks out but its just enough to be aware of your surroundings while enjoying your music
i leave the fit on tight to get the best isolation though you can conveniently loosen things up if you want
they feel very nice on my big head either way with the temple pads
the retro stylings are pretty cool and theyre definitely unique in their designsome problemsi like the portable collapse mode but the included case which is actually a very nice little pleather bag is too tight a fit
every time i squeeze the cans in there im afraid im going to break them or that im wearing the wire connections unnecessarily
ill probably end up using the pouch for some other purpose though since it is quite nice
along similar lines it seems like they cut the cost so low by chucking out a lot of the casing and other useless plastics on the headset but that makes them feel overly fragile
so far theyre holding up fine but they definitely feel a bit light
likewise the plug is a bit small and looks like a definite achilles heel
lastly the cord is only  so if your audio source isnt in your pocket or nearby you may run into trouble sans extensionsummarygreat deal for the money so why not
also packaging says koss covers them for life though well cross that bridge when we  come to itive had these for a while havent used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on cd
okay to good sound but the durability isnt great  one of the ear pieces constantly comes off
it can be replaced but its a nuisanceone of the best truly portable headphones you can get
perfect for portable devices if you dont mind looking a little geeky with its s styling
the next step up would be grado sr or sony mdrv which i own but those are a lot bulkier and more expensiveit has very strong bass for its size
the only thing i would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer
on the plus side it does have the koss lifetime warranty just pay the shippingi bought these after shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from  to  huh
anyway these sound just fine and are comfortablemy only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together that if i adjust it while on my head my hair can get caught under the band
yoowwwzaaaa
i dont have long hair so i would imagine it would be even worse for those peopleive heard nothing but good things about these and i finally decided to try them
the verdict
not bad at all for the price but im not sure they deserve such high praisepros obviously theyre very affordable and they sound pretty good
compact and very portablecons sound can be a bit muffled at times
sometimes theres a bit too much bass
this is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if youre listening for it at all
the touted feature thats supposed to make them more comfortable doesnt seem to do much at all for me
the cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hoursid buy them again if i had a tight budget and needed a set of compact portable headphones
but id think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if i could spend morethis morning they sold for  or something like that
then they jumped the price to only a  discount
now its a  discountthis is a bad business practice and amazon is doing this more and more
it lessens the ability to purchase a product
i was ready to doit but not when they suddenly jumped the price
i like the phones but not price jumps when i show interest in somethingthese sound amazing hands down the best under fifty you can buy
not as stylish as some or even as durable but with a lifetime warrenty you cant go wrongtheres not much i can add to whats already been said about the koss portapro headphones
these have got to be one of the best values out there today
sound is phenomenal
comfort for me is very good
the only area for concern that i could see was the quality of the cablejack
i added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress
i think that will be sufficient
highly recommend this productkoss porta pros are the headphone of choice if you like to listen loud with deep bass
they have a bit of trouble boosting treble because of this but they are well balanced for most recordings so it doesnt really mattermany have complained about the headphones being too tight but i have a pretty big grape and have no trouble wearing these on a two hour walki use these with my awesome archos jukebox recorder  and they are a killer combo
many mp players sacrifice a resonable amp for smaller size so these porta pros will help salvage players with diminutive ampsthe only complaint with my porta pros is they are open ear and people are always noticing my music even though they all admit im not listening that loud once they try them onvery deep bass for such little headphones needs a break in period top of head set can be a little uncomfortable in extended use other than that great valueif comfort is your issue these headphones do the job
i have very sensative ears
these heasdphones direct the pressure away from your ears and it is much more evenly distributed than any headphones ive tried besides my super expensive noise cancelling headphonesi think these are great for the price but they lack low end bass as they are compact and the padding simply isnt there to keep space to a minimum once again but overall im very much happy with them
keep an eye out for a video review on the sonicorbstudios youtube channel for more ive purchased  sets of these over the years for my son and his mother
 of the  are still going strong
my son has managed to destroy a pair of these and bunches of others but i digress
in every way possible these are great headphones
portable easy to use sufficient bass and fairly priced to boot
if i used an mp player of any kind id have a pair of these
since im more a fullrange stereo kinda guy my big boy sennheisers fill my bill
i have used these headphones on occaision however and cant recommend them more highlyda worfsterthings i like metal band seems durable and is easy to adjust sound quality affordable price im not an audiophile dont want to spend  on headphones but i still want headphones of significantly higher quality than earbuds lightweightthings i dont like nothing so fari wanted some higher quality headphones for use with my desktop computer i found many quality headphones at the  price point but wasnt looking for highend headphones
i just wanted a medium to mediumhigh quality pair at a decent price that would provide better quality sound than your standard headphones
after reading many reviews and doing a lot of research i found the portapros and am happy with them
the sound is more rich bass comes through surprisingly well without sacrificing the high end
they are comfortable to wear for an  to  hours at a time and are very lightweight so you dont always notice them on your head
i dont carry them around anywhere but the foldup mechanism does make these pretty portable if thats what you will use them for
im very pleased with these and would purchase them again they come with a lifetime warranty though so i may be set for lifeim sure there higher quality headphones out there that produce much better sound than these the portapros produce great sound for the average to slightly discerning listner and are priced affordably
to give you a better idea about the portapros sound qualityworst fuzzy crackly sound that makes it seem like your listing to a poorly tuned am stationbest sitting in an acoustically designed room listening to cutting edge  plus speakerspair of  jvc earbuds i got at walmart and junked within  minutes stock ipod earpieces my vizio soundbar with subwoofer koss portapros surround sound system well i have had these for quite a while and they are simply amazing in regards to sound quality especially for the price
the sound quality is a solid  stars
they have very crisp and accurate sound reproduction a spacious soundstage wonderfully controlled lowrange response and mids and highs that are just the right balance of warm and bright sound
they are clean and not sibilant at all
the only down side is the design
they are awkward to adjust and to wear
they also tend to pull your hair
the temple pads are a dumb idea on headphones that are so light and not noiseisolating
they also will not fit into or out of their included soft case without almost destroying them
but for sound quality alone these are absolutely untouchable at anywhere near the price rangewhen im really needing a portable headphone i usually go with the soundmagic es
they arent quite as nice to listen to as these koss porta pros but they also block out outside noise and are still amazing to listen to
they absolutely trounce any other earbuds i have listened to for under im actually surprised they still work after so long
they have decent quality nothing compared to a more expensive brand but still better than in earbuds and they are strong
i have sat on them and squashed them yet they still stayed together and kept their shape perfectly
the problem i had with them was the u shape of them would always get caught on other cables and chords and trust me that is so frustrating
also they always close automatically so you have to resize them every time you put them on
didnt mind either of these things the first few months then they eventually start getting to you trust me on this
overall for this price they are good durable portable headphones with good sound but those gripes i have lead me to not recommend them to constant music listenersfirst thing i thought when i heard of these headphones  really
people like these
theyre so uglyneedless to say i stopped worrying about how good they looked as soon as i heard how good they sounded
they have amazing bass and the highs and mids are clear without getting distorted or drowned out
the construction seems flimsy but as others have pointed out there is a lifetime warranty on these although you have to pay for sh
theyre light on the head and i can wear them for hours without any fatigue
however they are a good amount of sound so i wouldnt recommend listening to them in quiet areas like libraries or on a commute
all in all though i hate to sound cliche but this really is one of the best headphones for the pricefit only soso pressure adjustment flimsy
sound quality very good but not outstanding sound leaks very noticeableprobably not fair to compare these to my last set which were pxs and cost considerably more so i wont do that cause pxs theyre not
that said they are decent enough for the price
i was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since i shave my head and these have no pads but they fit fine stay on my head and are comfy enoughthey produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the pxs for sure
but since they are mainly for the time i spend on the stair master at the gym the sound quality is more than adequate
they block most of the background noise but i can still hear a bit of whats going on around me which is not a bad thingas for portability they fold up small enough but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided which is pretty much useless
without it its a pain since i keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled
for some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging
hopefully over time it will straighten a bit
not a big deal though and i can make do with some other bag for storing themhow well they hold up is yet to be seen
im pretty hard on my headphones and have yet to have a pair last more than two years
they look solid enough but i have my doubts
for the price though its not a big dealoverall i am happy with the purchase and would say the rating on these is about rightthe sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics
the ergonomics are good once you get them on but the headband and the tension adjustment for the earpads are fiddly
i find that the sennheiser px or the akg k offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfortfor the cash you cant get better
plus clear sound low power consumption comfy pads minus not really collapsible hard to adjust firmness buttons hair gets caught in band and i have very short hair
mated with cowons i youd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound
not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes
glad i purchased the oldie but goodiesure these headphones arent exactly comparable to top of the line sennheisers or other expensive head phones but for the reasonable price i got just what i wanted a lightweight bass prone pair of head phones that with the right eq on my ipod actually sounds very good
i carry these with me for my travels where they serve as movie and music headphones and they do a great job
would i want to take a more audiophile approach i would turn to a pair of hd s or similar but these do just what theyre supposed to doreally like emyep
an old classic
no styling changes for plus years
but they got it right the first time
very lightweight and excellent sound
i use grados for my serious listening but these are just super for portable use
probably why they call them portapro
only complaint the top band is a little tweeky and thin
a wider band would render these bad boys perfect
cant do better for the bucks though
happy listeningive been using them for almost a year now
sound is very good not fabulous
could be a bit crisper and have more presence
if you like bass this is your set awesome too much for my taste really
nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear
pops open too easily when folded up
sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head
an earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times but it pops right back in seems fragile but is more durable than it looks
adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head
consider whether you would rather have noisecanceling or inline volume adjuster before you decide
if not its a good choice and a good valuemay  update i had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement only paid shipping
they sent me a new unit
its cheap its good and its a keeper in my book even  years laterfeb
 update still going strongmar
 update keeps going and goingi work at an office and i wear headphones   hours per week
and let me say that i have tried them all
everything from earbuds to onear and even over the ear headphonesa friend of mine suggested the portapros to me
at first i was turned off because of the way they looked but i decided to take a chance
once i got them on i think they look cool and my fianceacute calls them my tron headphones
i have actually grown to like the retro s lookbut on to the sound they sound amazing
i wont even say for the price
they just sound great
i needed a headphone that were open air that way i can still hear my coworkers around me
these are onear open air design but dont let that fool you
they have great bass response and sound crystal clear no matter what the volume is
keep in mind i work in a pretty quiet environment so i am not sure how theyd hold up on a busy city busthe fit is also great
they are so adjustable
it took me a few days to find just the right fit but now that i have i will never go to any other headphone for daytoday use
i have a great pair of sony s for podcasting  studio environment but these are so great for work and travel
the way they fold up is genius and koss even included a nice little pouch to store them inall in all i give it an a
the only reason i didnt give  stars is because that the cord is just a bit too short
other than that these headphones are a completely solid investmentpretty good sound i like more bass and these are balanced
ipod touch powers them just finewe bought many of these for christmas for the kids tablets ipods laptops pcs and the noise level in the house thanked usthe sound quality is astounding considering the price
these far outperform anything that says beats on it at a tiny fraction of the price our very brand conscious son actually bought and immediately returned a  pair after using thesethe sound is again spectacularthe comfort however is less than stellar the steel band hurts the top of their heads after a while and they do cause some pretty ugly hair tangles for the girls
for intermittent use theyre fine  but in long sessions they have been associated with frequent whiningthe only real downside weve found is that the cords are outrageously frail
one yank trip or snag related and theyre toast
the conductors are so tiny that repair almost requires microsurgical procedures
it can be done but youll need a jewelers eyepiece tiny fingers and a lot of patienceforewarned is forearmedi was going to reorder another set of sennheiser pxii because the cord started to short out at the plugin point
i like using open air headsets at the office and while taking the pooch for a walk so that i can be aware of whats going on around me
just when i was about to click add to cart i noticed the suggestion at the bottom featuring the koss portapro headphones
i immediately remember these guys from back in the sony walkman days
upon further reading reviews i decided to go for them and heres what i think after a good amount of usage i like to grade my product reviews
hope this helpslooks  ok i must admit that at first i thought they looked very retro and had a nostalgic feel to them
however as i put them on and looked at myself in the mirror i started to feel a bit awkward and dorkish
that sensation intensified as i walked down the street and noticed people giving me weird looks
honestly i really didnt care but noticed it nonethelessbuild   these headphones seem well constructed
however the thinness of the headband which is made of an aluminum strap is a concern
i wouldnt want to overly bend it for sure
there are also a lot of moving parts and the ear plates are made of plastic
i would not advise to step or even sit on them
the cable is rather thin but overall if you treat them with respect they should be able to last and the lifetime warranty puts me at easecomfort   hands down he portapros are easily the most comfortable headsets ive worn in a long time
theyre super light so youd hardly think they are on your head
the ear pads can feel a bit strange when first putting them on but quickly become seamless
and they feature a slide to ease pressure just in case
they are more comfortable and secure on my head than my old pxssound   i proudly own several types of headphones from audiotechnica to bose to sony and even lesser known great quality brands
i love sound dont consider myself an audiophile so i dont take my listening lightly
these little guys provide outstanding performance for the money
the open nature of these headsets provides a very wide warm natural feel to whatever youre listening to
the highs are very clear and do not bleed into the other frequencies
the mids are very distinctive and present
the bass is punchy without being overwhelming my pxs were a bit too bassy
i can listen to all genres from rock to hip hop to classical and equally enjoy them without adjusting the equalizer setting flat response
live music is definitely a pleasure to hear with these guysfunctionality   carrying them around is rather easy
they fold into a small tight ball and they fit into a little pouch provided by koss
getting them into this position is easy and intuitive
they fit into any bag without taking too much space
the cord is light weight and of good length
i wish the mm plug was bent  because i put my portable device in my back pocket and sticks out a bit
one little gripe that most have is that when placing them on your head the autoadjust process happens automatically and you hair can get caught in the sliders
ouch
but fortunately that doesnt happen too often
they dont leak sound as much as i thought they would and thats a plusoverall   i am a believer now
while i do not use these for commuting subway trains because of the inability to block out sound the koss portapros have become the goto headset to beat while walking around the neighborhood with my dog
the sound quality and comfortableness more than make up for the hitormiss retro looks
highly recommendedthese headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar
for a sub  price you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price
but it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over the bass which was great by s standards cant handle the lower frequencies as well as high end shure earphones
otherwise there is very little distortion of the soundthe level of detail in the sound is impressive
i did hear many sounds mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music which i couldnt hear with my inferior ipod headphones
but again the level of detail is not as good as shure earphonesif you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior ipod headphones with something superior then this headphone is great
unless you want to look retro s however you may want to wear them insidesynposis good sound quality relatively comfortable and can be registered for a lifetime warranty with koss
not much else that can be asked for from a set of headphones at this prices rangethe sound quality and comfort are both fairly exceptional although it should be noted that they let a lot of sound leak both in and out courtesy of their design
on the other hand for a traveling headphone of light build that isnt always a problem
the lifetime warranty should be noted as well
i had to use it once because one of the sides went dead but they replaced the set and im back to enjoying themthese are simply awesome
im not an audiophile by any means but i do have a few pairs of expensive and sophisticated earphones with supersonic so and so and ultraisonalting this and that
theyre great and have their uses but if all you need is a pair of earphones that you can carry in your jacket pocket or laptop bag you wont find a serious competitor to the portaprostheyre compact sturdy and of reasonable quality
will you get the same quality as a pro set of headphones
of course not but you likely dont need high fidelity if youre on the metro studying watching youtube or perusing your podcastsif you need a pair of nifty retro collapsible and decent quality headphones pick these upnote that the phones themselves are about the size of an average ear
they will not cover your entire earreally nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job
if youu dont want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this setexcellent sound reproduction
comfortable
cord just the right length so that i can put my minidisc player in my pocket
just one thing that keeps me from giving them  starts
every time i take them off the metal bands slide so that i have to readjust them every time i put them on again
a set of headphones like these that stayed the way i set them would get  starsadded in edit  amazon lets you edit your reviews but not your starrankings
im not changing a word of the text but having to adjust the headband is proving to be an annoyance
lower my star ranking to   from what i gather there are lots of good headphones out there
i wouldnt buy another pair of thesei bought these on the recommendation of cnet and i wasnt disappointed
they sound great and they fold well for easy carrying
for a nonaudiophile please note that before any other comments  i didnt hear much difference between several other more expensive sets
they have a rich sound and i have yet to listen to anything they dont play well
however there is one huge thing that isnt stressed enough here although i did see it mentioned before i purchased mine
i bought mine to study with and no one will study with me anymore due to the leakage
these leak a lot
my wife can hear me listening to lectures and my study partners can hear my music three seats down
they are great but should not be purchased to listen to in a library
the hair pulling happens occasionally but you get past that by putting them on carefully and it isnt a huge hassle
a little hard for me to get in the carry case also
i am purchasing another set for study but let me be clear i am keeping these for all other uses
i just want to make sure you dont buy these for quiet surroundingsupdate  these headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw
the stereo connector is very flimsy
despite being very careful mine broke in under a year
the stereo connector literally just pulled apart as i was removing it from the ipod one day
the wires pulled right out of the connector
after checking the web i see i am not the only one to experience this
someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above in the product photos
i still think theyre great headphones and i ordered a new  pair although i plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare
i knocked off one star simply because now i have to shell out  plus shipping to replace this set although i opted to pay  for a new pair to save time
however if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first prepare to watch the review stars plummet
what good is something if it wont last at least a year
 end of update ive tried pretty much all types of headphones
i was looking for a good solid pair under  preferably overtheear but not too big for gym athletic use and better portability
i stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them so i came to amazon to read some reviews
seeing that they were highly rated here as well i ordered a pair
these headphones have a solid reputation for a reason they sound great
the minute i plugged them in i knew why they were so highly rated
clear highs deep lows
i mean its not bone rattling bass but its decent enough if you dont want to lug around a pair of  selfpowered heavy headphones
easily the best sounding headphones ive bought the past year
and thats in a group of skull candy sony apple self powered noise canceling ive tried it all the past year
the only extremely minor gripe i have is that i agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times
i like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic cant tell you how many plastic headphones ive inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it
they do come with a lifetime warranty which is pretty sweet although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a  check
something potential purchasers should be aware of
im happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess fullsized soundpros compact light weight lifetime warranty great sound for sizeprice
moving around much
they have a tight grip on your head
durable i once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and i simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened
short cord for people who dont wander  feet away from their audio player laptop mp player like some other headphones havecons  ive heard people say how comfy they are but my hat size of   says very different
after a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache
and thats whether i have sound running through them or not
on occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting themi use these for my laptop and ipod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming
base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough
mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as i like the  deg ones much better but it works regardless
id recommend these to other people
the only drawback i can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours
maybe if you have a smaller head youll be ok
they can seem flimsy but ive had them for  years and have traveled with them so i couldnt justify and claims of them being cheap headphones
and with a lifetime warranty i say go to town
i dont use the case at all either used to but i deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere
no regrets on thati would give the product  stars but the headache thing really detracts from them
i still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones id go with these again any day of the week
maybe not tuesdaythis is a decent headphone it works without issue and the wires seem to be thick enough not to bend and break leaving only  side working
however since i wear glasses they seem to be a little tight for extended use however if you can remove them for awhile every couple of hours then i would definetly recomend these especially at less than why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic earcups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews
because they sound amazing
nothing in this price range even comes close
most people compare these with the sennheiser px ii
well i have both and they are both excellent headphones and the sennheisers are much better quality but the sound of the portapros is much better
i am on my second pair and will buy another when this set breaksi find them comfortable enough
they are also small and light
they do sound fine to me but i am not a great judge of that anymore
however there is one annoying thing the short cord
i am sure thats all in the eyes of the beholder but thats how i feeli agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones
they sound phenomenal for the price
the only negative is the weakness of the cords
after a year or two of normal use one side or the other may break its connection and theres no way you can fix it yourself many tiny strands to solder
i have returned mine twice to koss great lifetime warranty and they have replaced them for a small  shipping charge
it takes about  weeks
thats my only complainteverything the the other reviewers said seems to be true
much much better sound and more comfortable than the standard earbuds
i flew  hours back to the us from germany after watching  movies they are immensely comfortable
they do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them
very nice sound for an under  set of headphones
the lifetime warranty was the final clincher for methese headphones work great
i use them with my ipod touch and my laptop
they are light extremely comfortable and have excellant sound
tough to beat for the cost and the koss warrenty is the best
highly recommendive had these headphones for close to ten years and primarily use them when i travelprosgreat soundlifetime warrantyonce you have them on your head and adjusted they stay thereconsno volume controlthey press so firmly on the side of my head it gets uncomfortable after a while even using the pressure setting switch on lightive had them in twice for repair  lost sound on one side for no apparent reason  im not hard on them and dont use them that often only a few times a yearevery time i take them off they lose their adjustment settingsthey really need to come with a better case
mine came with a drawstring pouch that was difficult to insert the phones into i lost it when i sent them back for repair the first time
koss has some hard cases but one of the comments was that the case was way too big  not conducive to traveloverall grade  a for sound b for comfort c for sturdiness the missing volume control and case and the minor annoyancesoverall im pleased with these would not have kept them for ten years otherwise but perfect they aintthese things have been around forever because they sound great
sure they look funny but if youre just chillin at home do iti bought these along with a similarly priced set of sennheiser headphones about  months ago
not until i recently purchased a zen micro did i decide to test all my headphones on this mp player
needless to say other than the bose qc set which is essentially in a league of its own the koss beat out every other set i own
this includes both denon and sony closed systemsi guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase
so they were relegated to the bookshelf until the zen player arrived
i have to say that the goofy looking design is just that
however the sound quality clarity separation tonal balance etc
is exceptional for an open ear system
nearly every bit as good as the bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at timesif youre considering buying this headphone dont hesitate
its worth your money
i use it for my ipod and my computer
i never thought headphone this price will sound this good
my only dislike is the looksi really like these headphones but as others point out they are not very durable
my first pair broke after a year  and i am very careful with my equipment
i only use them at my computer they dont travel or get abused
they fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot
anyway the sound was great  very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs
they sound nearly as good as my entrylevel grados but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods
but buy two pairs now or plan on replacing them latereditseveral years later i am back to say that the two additional pairs i bought are both going strong and they are still the best qualitycomfortprice combination in the world
i have more accurate inear phones that cost  but for comfort and long listening sessions these cant be beat
i hope they are never discontinued
the design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head but once you hear them you wont carethe portapro has very good sound and basebut the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big earsso i sent them back to amizonexpo
the seenheiser pxs also sound very goodbut not quite as good as the portaprosi do like the pxs because they are very comfortableeasy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potaprosbut im still looking for a better headphonei picked this because of the high ratings these headphones have been getting high ratings for years
the quality of sound reproduction they do deserve a high rating
if you arent using them a noisy environmentthey have no real passive or active noise blocking
you cant be dissatisfied with the quality of sound reproductioni was surprised by the light build and somewhat small size of them
they certainly dont make a satisfying thud when you toss them onto a coffee table  which probably isnt that good of idea anyway
so this lightness and somewhat small size i can just as easily viewed as a plus as well a minusi really expected headphones which has been manufactured for decades to come with an rca phonoplug rather than a modern one
while i find it probably handier to have a modern type plug on the headphones i really think they should have included a phonoplug  adapter with itim not going against the years of reviews before mine
the sound from these headphone are clear crisp and has a fine frequency range
i seriously doubt youre going to find anything  better than these headphones when theyre on sale
the quality of sound reproduction was what i expected i was just startled by the small size and heft of them
you might find that a very pleasant surprisecnet had these as the beall and endall but i found them to be average on my beats audio type touchscreen computerthese are big on bassi actually put some grado g cushions over the stock on here and that made them more balanced sounding
i havent tried the kramer mod see headfi  but could be the way to gooverall i would easily recommend these
if you have a bright sounding source or great for moviesthe most amazing property of these headphones is that its almost like youre wearing nothingtheyre light and comfortable and the pressure of the ear pads is adjustable on both sidesthese are probably the most comfortable headphones ive ever worn and ive owned many sets of headphones from sony panasonic seinheiser ultrasonethe extra set of head pads above the ears reduces the pinching on the ears you get with most headphonesthat said the sound quality here im using the word quality literally as in flavor not how good the sound is is punchy and bassy at the sacrifice of high end and midrangei tested these headphones with a sony himd lossless minidisc player with a flac audio sourcethese headphones are what i would call teenager headphones
they have sound properties that kids would look forif you listen to a lot of music that has valuable high frequency sound properties you may wish to look elsewhere
the high and midrange on these headphones is a little muddythe first thing i will say is that when i got these headphones they were a lot smaller than i envisioned
the retro look reminded me of some old headphones i had that were much larger
i suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portablesprosthe sound quality is great for portables
they sound even better than some of the lowerend earcovering studio headphones that i have
i have always liked koss attention bass response in their headphones
the cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about  feet
dont get these if you like longer cords
they fold up very nicely and compact
it comes with a carrying case and  to  adapter
they are pretty light and comfortable though a little tighter on wider headsconsthey feel somewhat cheap and i imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit
my head is on the larger side while not huge and i find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting
they dont seem to cater well to larger heads
i wish they had some kind of padding on the top of the headbandthese are really good portable headphones with great sound quality as long as your head isnt hugethe headphones work quite well
they dont feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound
i use them on the treadmill as i dont like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into themafter  years with my pair i finally blew out the diaphragms
bought  pair of highend bose headphones
was quite disappointedlike others have said these units have changed little since the mid s but have fanastic range thump and boom
light weight comfortable and affordable
highly responsive coils and foldable designhighly highly recommended as in my opinion being the best portable nonnoise cancelling phones on the marketwill make your mp player walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatiguecept after  or more hours of usegetting another pair asapi bought the koss portapro headphones to replace the earbuds for my mp player
theyre light comfortable and have decent audio capabilities
you can fold them up and put them in my pocket
im generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again
my only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame
theres only a small notch and groove holding them together
reassembling them when the earpieces come off isnt a huge hassle but it is annoyingimpressive set for the money but obviously not professional quality
it does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times
if you want a good cheap headset this is an impressive option for the price range its ini wanted a pair of headphones that were lightweight convenient to carry in my dailyuse sling bag and offered decent sound while being affordable
this set meets all of my criteria and im very pleased with themi bought the koss porta and the panasonicrpdjsbecause my grado i poofed into disintegration
im poor so who cares
anyway
lets go
the koss portapros are great if you are using an i pod such device
the sound they give is very clear and crisp
i actually hooked them up to my onyko  rms surround sound system at  volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but closethe koss portapro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money
the displacement with these is incredible
the sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite
they are worth iti bought the panascrew it look above ok these are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the koss
koss has a lot higher range than the panasonic
the panasonic i think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume
i personally like that
you listen to music loud to get into it
so you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them
they are very good and better than akg m mk for the price bucks cheaper that the kossso whos the bestthe koss portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good
koss also stood up to my stereothe panasonic sound muffled compared to the koss but not that much
panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your headthis can be annoying though
the panasonic are built though wires wont fall out and you can depend on them on a  rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound
they are ok no sennheiser or grado  sony mdr  sound qualityi choose the koss for my ipods and laptops but i choose the panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system
these are  different headphones
one is used for ipods and laptops the other is designed for everything
you like sound get koss
you want everything with a lack in areas get the panasonic
they are both constructed by someone who thought about the design
boy is that importantgreat sound for the price
dont be alarmed at the style of these headphones because they are not the size of those big closed back referencemonitor earmuffs
these are the smaller walkman style
i was surprised at the size because the photos make them seem large
good bass and treble response but i can see how they could get broken easily
just take care of them and they will be ok a little weird trying to fit on your head for the first timethe package depicted plastic clamshell is not the package i received
i received a very nice upscale black box packaging with a photo of the headphones on them in the style of ipod packagingpros  lightweight and comfortable even for people with glassesgood soundgreat pricecons a little flimsy mostly because of the metal bandcompared to my larger audio technica ats they match up well
the main difference is in the bass response and loudnessit takes a little more power to drive the ats so the koss is louder the closed back of the ats provide a little less treble and more of a surrounding live sounding bass compared to the koss
but it is just a matter of preference
the ats are also heavier and glass wearers will be hurting for sure
ill keep the ats for the studio and the koss for general listening
you cant go wrong with the portaprosthese cans are not as good as my grado srs however they are very good
the bass is realistic
the highs are crisp
the midrange is balanced with the bass and highs
i dont transport them very much however they do fold up and store quite nicely
one thing which i consider a real plus is the metal band across the head
the band makes it absolutely simple to adjust the width between ears of the drivers without damaging the headset
for a set of sub cans these are a great choice
ive heard that the koss sportapro isnt as good as these koss portapros
if that is the case id stay away from them and get the portapro instead
unlike my grado srs these drivers do not require additional amplification when used with my ipod or ipod touchsounds good but not great
will do the job
would not recommend for music
what else can i say about themfor the money this is a good quality piece
the wide metal band is durable but at the same time awkward because it is so wide
there were only two problems
one is that it hurts my ears a little
but that is livable
the other is that it advertises that it comes with a case which is actually a cheap plasticy bag that is slightly smaller then the headphones
i really need a carrying case so i will have to find something else stronger and a little large so i can carry this in my pack without destroying itthese headphones are ugly but sound great they are also very comfortable
perfect for home i wouldnt wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noisecancellingpros sound is great bass and all ipodiphone friendly plug lightweight and comfortable the price is rightcons need to readjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off not very cool looking i would probably buy these in black if i was ordering againi dont hear high frequency very well so take my sound review for what it is worth
good bass and midrange sound  very pleasant sound quality
crank up the power and they do not over drive or distort
these are not sound expert headphones but they sound as good as or better than the bose overtheear head phones i have tried
they fit comfortably on the ear but will slip some if one moves the head too quickly
i like the durable head band molded into the plastic
they fold up very nicely for storage in the bag
cord length is sufficient without being too long
i like them but they were purchased for my grandson now we will see how durable they are
great value for a reasonable price from amazoni use the headphones to listen to tv and pc
they are lighter and smaller than the picture led me to believe which is a good thing
the side foam pads for your temples really help keep the pressure off your ear
but this pressure is also adjustable by sliding tabs on the tops of the headphone part
so you can get just the right amount of pressure
the sliding metal bands allow for a large range of size
with the sliding metal bands and a hinged earpieces the unit folds up to a compact size
i really like these but i never give five starssound of koss portapros is truly remarkable
great sound for any price
my one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as i would like
works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit
also wish the headphones were a little more portable
they dont really fold up as small as i would like
lest i sound like too great a critic i would purchase them again
in fact i sent my soninlaw a pair for christmasi got these to replace my  yr old senn px  which suddenly got broken at the miniplug these are not as comfortable as the px  but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just  i could not pass them up
theyre also very sensitive which makes them ideal for ipods and other portable devicesthese headphones are great
ive been using them around town for about two weeks
they sound really good
the bass isnt overly punchy or  overwhelming but sounds really nice
the whole sound is very clear through the linkin park incubus pendulum bonobo and some other tracks that ive listened to with these headphonesmy only complaint is that they feel a bit flimsy and i try to be really careful with them
so far ive dropped them once and theyre finei wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones
this one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears so doesnt push on the frame
sound isnt bad either
i use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of usegot a couple of these for  each and my wife and i use them to watch netflix and such
they are very good for what they are
comfortable secure without being tight
easy to fold up for protection
open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching not possible with higher quality earbuds we have
especially if you find them at this price go for itget the sportapros instead
they look better can be worn in a street configuration cost less and sound exactly the samefor sound quality you would be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range
true theres a few products out there some senn earbuds come to mind but you could spend a lot more and get something that doesnt sound this good
dont expect any isolation though these are open to the air as most of the best sounding headphones arefor comfort they are soso
theyre not the worst ive used but the band isnt particularly comfortable
the design is also prone to catch hairs i have short hair so it doesnt bother me so much but once in a while it catches one and rips it outthe styling is very s which well makes sense since they were designed in the s
i guess that is good or bad depending on what you likeoh the case they come with is useless
youll never get them to fit back in the case
i think the bag itself is physically large enough to contain them but the opening is notdont let the design deter youthese headphones produce excellent sound with good volume bass and frequency range
for the reasonable price i dont think you will be disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones
also they can be compactly stored designed to fold together and carried within included caseokay the badtheyre not the most comfortable overtheear headphones with a pretty tight feel and a bit difficult to adjust
also the metalplastic headband slide has grabbed my hair a bit without following through with a kisswhen i first started using headphones over  years ago now koss was the brand to get
this still seems to be true today
overall these are very good sounding headphones for a reasonable pricethe fit is both tight and comfortable very usable on pretty much any exercise machine
earbuds arent an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears and these are just perfect
the folding design works well in a gym bag tooplenty of bass and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap mp player
i wouldnt mistake these for my dearlydeparted grado srs but theyre half the price and much more portablei had a pair of these in the early s and loved them back then tooi recently went though a spate of headphones   pair in this price range
this is by far the best sounding of the group by far
and i find myself using them the most often
as a matter of fact they sound better than my studio headphones audio technica that cost about  more
the only problem i have is that they can get uncomfortable after an hour or two of use and they stick to your hair
if you have long hair anything after a s crewcut they will stick to your hair and pull it when you adjust them and take them offtotally worth it  great sound and all  as long as you dont mind the problem with the ouchy hairno wonder these phones have been around for so long
i was surprised when i heard them
i mean for the money you spend i feel you get more quality sound then not
all ranges sound really good
the low end i felt was really nice to hear
all ranges come out good
about the down side
well i dont feel i have room to complain
they have a lifetime warrantee
you dont need any ra you mail them to koss and they either repair or replace it
this was a large part of my deision in buying these
they have short wires and the wires are thin
would of been nice if they made them with an exrta couple feet of length
you do need care to handle them cuz they seem a bit fragile but so long as you take care they should lastwould i recomend them
yes i wouldreviews are great sound is great comfort is awesome you almost cant feel they are therehowever some geek has decided to skip the two different methods of plug that have worked just fine since plugs were invented
instead of a plug going straight in or a plug with a  degree bend they have decided to be cute and have used a plug that has a  degree bend
in one great flash of brilliance insert sarcasm here they have managed to get the bad features of both other plug designs
it sort of sticks out and it is sort of able to follow the line of the player
but not quiteif i keep these i will be rewiring to a standard plugbad idea koss
otherwise great headphone with a great history now with an odd little glitchthese have very good sound
relatively comfortable on head
i like being able to hear surrounding sounds so i appreciate thatsounds good enough even to a discreet audiophile  at this price point
i use it to listen to itunes on my laptop and it sounds far better than the laptop speakers
it sounds especially decent when listening to jazz classical music and ballads
djdance hall music and the like sounds good too but would sound even better with more bass
the head phones are a very good all rounder
go ahead and get it if you are on a budgeti was looking for a pair of headphones that had great sound quality and that didnt cut out all ambient noisethese delivered in all aspects and won me over with their vintage appeal
the sound is bright crisp undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglassesi was tempted by vintage cans like the sennheiser hds but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the koss portapros
the hds also need a powerful amp for them to shine and im just plugging into my mac and ipod most of the timethe koss portapros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price youd be hardpressed to find another set that rivals their sound quality and designi have been modding and testing headphones out for the past  years and these are my favorite
they can be used for any genre you can think of
excellent sound all around and they arent even burned in yet
highly recommended for comfort and soundupdate i am returning these unfortunately
although they are great they are not so good for exercising
i didnt even attempt it but if you get sweat inside the ear cushions it will go straight to the driver
they are great for portable use still as well
they also were a little tight on my head even with the light mode on
the light mode also wasnt working very well
i have a bigger than normal sized head though
if you have a normal or small head these would fit great
it just clamped too hard for me
while i still recommend them they are just made way too cheaply and hurt my headok here goesi wont waste much time on the looks as you pretty much see what you get which resembles a  set of phones from the sim ok with the looks if the quality is on markoverall these look pretty cheesey as the cords as well as the plastics are very thini worry about the plug coming apartthe sound is good and has nice bass responsemids and highs are not over done as i like quality bass over cymbals thrashing etc and it has a warm and acurate tone overall which i likethe fit is good and is adjustablebut tends to want to reset if you use thelightpressure setting unless you take them off just rightthey do fold up very well thoughthe chance of grabbing your hair is real though not a big dealoverall they have a comfortable fitthese do little to hold outside noise out or music inso others can hear your music and you can hear them which is ok as i expected this from the designi wanted to write a review as almost all reviews praise these to godlike status in this price range
they are very good and yes they get better after a breakinfor this money they should be on your short listit appears people have luck with these lasting for years and are a product really worth the price for onceupdate holding up and sounding greati had a pair years ago and lost them
if you want a solid pair of headphones that sound excellent these are the headphones for you
i cant believe how many have bought into the beats headphone hype with their muddy bass and  sound decay at high volumes
save your money on most headphones selling in the  range koss sound just as good if not better
the only issue whats up with the mini case
its a     getting those phones into that little bitty koss bag make the case largertitle of this review pretty much sums it up
the bass is a bit too heavy for my liking
however the overall quality is very good
my son took a listen and he loved them
he and his sister have a birthday coming up so i think i will pick up a couple pair
good value for the moneysound is great for such an extremely lightweight headphone construction durability remains to be seen
very foldable  portable
lovehate wear procedure  bit of a nuisance because of the thin spring headband you must spread out the earpieces all the way you cant just slip them over your head and ears wear the headset and then tighten the head band and clickadjust the comfort buttons to get a good fit
great  value with koss lifetime replacement warranty
appeared flimsy on first blush but on the other hand it is very flexible and should survive most abuse
however as mentioned in other reviews the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear vulnerablefragile and should have strainreliefs which is present at the plugend of the cable note for kossi have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time
koss offers a an excellent product
you cant go wrong with this purchase
great bass highly enjoyable sound
sounds a little heavy but still very listenable
please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music
highly recommendedthese headphones sound great and the price cant be beat
i use them frequently
i did not give them  stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use  hours and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close bykoss portapro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular of course you do not expect it to be at the price
a great valueproduct arrived as scheduled and nicely packaged
had my doubts with the koss brand as i never believed it was a premier brand
the sound is very nice and balanced
good bass and not overwhelming
the design is a little outdated but i grew up in the s so it is fine with me
in fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics fast times at ridgemont high on amazon instant video
good bang for your buck and definitely a true valuemy old sennheiser pxs were finally dying after about five years and it was time to find a new pair of joggingtraveling around headphones
the pxs were great but with the success of that product sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so i figured it was time to tryout their koss counterparts
im a big fan of the portapros they have punchy bass midrange is good and the treble is not too piercing
the result is a very good product though i have to admit i dont like the sound quite as much as the sennheisers
i think that the main problem is the bass its good but the sennheisers had a dynamic fat bass sound that the portapros cant quite reach
im a fan of a variety of music and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all
with electronic music and in particular hiphop the limits of the bass show up
i should say that i do have perhaps an overfondness for lowend sounds so its possible that youll like the fact that the bass isnt as strong with the portapros
i will also say that while i dont like these portapros quite as much as the pxs i dont think that the pxs are worth their new  price tag and i would purchase these koss headphones again if giving the choicefor the price these sound great and are comfortable
i can wear them for hours without problems
the bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it
i like the open ear design for use at work as i can hear when people are talking to me
the whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my earsmy biggest complaint is with the portability or rather the compromises made for that portability
they fold up decently small and very easily
this ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head even for a second
since i use these at work i just keep them at my desk and dont need them to fold up
id rather that they didnt so i could adjust them exactly how i want and never have to bother againedit october  ive had these since july  and they still sound great but i have run into a few issuesthey tend to unfold in my bag if i take them with me
not a big deal but it tends to tangle the cord when that happensthe plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart
it was annoying to keep putting them back together but some superglue has fixed the problemafter  years the cushions have fallen apart
theyre pretty thin to begin with so no real surprise and replacements are under  for three pairs but kind annoyingstill id buy another pair if i had to
maybe a nonportable versiona classic headphone that should be in everyones collection these headphones have remained the same for the last  over years recently it has finally been made to allow iphone users to enjoy these with the mic functiongreat headphones
comfortable but not especially lite weight
i would purchase again
i like the single cord
xxx xxx xxxxworks great for my needs but im not a fan of the coiled wire and angled plug
thankfully the coil is a softer compound so it doesnt pull on my head during use but i would have preferred a straight wire
i know i know it was in the details
well i admit i apparently didnt read them allthe angled plug is more an issue since a straight plug fits my needs betteri shopped koss based on another koss headset i bought
id buy koss again obviouslyim not an audiophile but i think these sound good
mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding soundsi have been using mine at work every day of the week
they are just as good as the day i bought them
i have dropped them a few times but they dont seem to careif these ever break i will buy another pair
good value for the price
updatedi have now had these for a few months
using them right now as i type i use them everyday at work i drop them regularly and they look and work as good as the day i bought themi bought these for my father who is temporarily bedridden
they are ideal for the rough treatment this entailslots of cord tugging pulling and crushing
they block out noise better than the openear style tooi use these to monitor playback during recording sessions
they sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable
three more wordsi got these because my noisecanceling phones also koss died
while they are repairingreplacing i got these
they are good for my stereo
if however you use them in the pc and want outside noise blocked they are not as good as the noise cancelling onesthese are very comfortable headphones
i dont notice any ear fatigue at all
they are tuned for a little extra bass which some may not like but this is one of the reasons i chose koss
essentially they always have the loud turned on
i dont turn the volume up very loud but i still want to feel the kick drum and bass guitar when playing musicadditionally the other frequencies are still heard
voices are easily heard
for  these are excellent headphones
the only reason i didnt give them  stars is that the cord maintains the shape it was in from the box too long
it doesnt forget that it was folded and that is easily forgiven considering the price paid
they are big but i listen to these at home when the kids are asleep and i dont want to wake themive had mine for three years now and i find the urs indispensible since i live in an apartment and cant turn the tv up to a decent level otherwise
theres reasonable bass you would expect so for the size of them
always look at the specs
the low number is the bass the high number usually in the tens of thousands is the treble
this sets bass is  hertz
thats thats not a bad number  is average  would be phenomenal
the treble is set at  hertz
theoretically only dogs can hear frequencies above that but i think a headphone with a figure over that just seems to sound brighter in the treble which is what i like
i hate unclear treble and muddy distorted bass
another number you look at is sensitivity the better ones are always over  so i guess based on the specs these phones are about averagethe cord length is excellent at  feet
i can be a reasonable distance away from the tv without straining the cord ive even slept with them on without ear fatiguethese headphones make movie watching a whole new experienceyou get surround sound without the expenseive had a great experience with the urs and i recommend them for use with home theater even if you just have a quot portable like mine
you need an adapter to plug them into a home stereo and theres plenty of cord where you can be either reasonably mobile or you can sit in your favorite chair some distance away
i think theyre great
the only thing that would make them the best is better specs and thats hard to find at this price rangegiven their price these are pretty decent headphones and worth the cashmy only two problems with it  first they need to be resized every time you put them on because they seem to suffer from quotpool shrinkagequot  they shrink to the smallest size once you take them offand second is the one brought up fairly often  they dont do anything to block out outside noise
which isnt that big a deal as i didnt really need noiseblocking headphones anywaythis headphones are very comfortable i would recomend to anyone that need a nonexpensive headphones i only use them with my pc the only thing i didnt like was the bass i almost can hear itestos audifonos son muy coacutemodos tienen un buen volumen y buen aislamento de sonido lo recomiendo a cualquiera que necesite unos audifonos no tan caros yo solo los utilizo para mi computadora me parece que son muy grandes para cargarlos siempre encima pero de todas formas ese era el uso que le queria dar lo uacutenico malo es que le falta maacutes bajothese earphones are big
seriously the picture does not prepare you for how large they are
but their large size helps to the be very comfortablethe sound is not as good as i was hoping
things tend to sound a little mushy through them to me
but for under  you wont find anything better
based on prior experience with koss earphones im expecting these to last a very long timetheir large size and lack of audio isolation makes them best for use in the home
i use mine for computer games and watching movies on my laptopi really do like these headphonesthey sound pretty goodare very comfortable
this is rare for me as i have a big headthey have a very nice coiled long cordthe only negative is that they are uglybut hell they are inexpensive to i bought these headphones as a replacement for my sennheiser hd which i loved
the problem with my hds and many other headphones i owned many is that i would lose sound in one of the ears after a long period of time
usually after  months i found out that due to twisting wires i would wrap my wire around the headphones after use it could damage them and the special coating inside themthis is one of the reasons i love these headphones
there is a coiled wire and its only attached to one side
very clever indeed also the wire isnt a ridiculous ft
long
the construction of them is plastic so it doesnt feel the strongest
my first pair arrived damaged and i had to get a replacementsound quality is usual
nothing outstanding but its not terrible believe me it has quality sound
just dont be expecting bose qualityit fits my head nicely
for the price i recommend these to anyone who wants some great headphonesright you can spend a lot of money on headphones and not hear much more
these are well worth twice the pricenot the most expensive brand top end noise cancelling headphones
but these work great with lumix and microphone in a crowd
cuts a lot of the ambient sound to make hearing dialogue easier in a crowded settingthis review is for the koss ur headphones
the sound is pretty good but i personally feel like the bass is lacking
its ok i guess
i love the cord length
my previous headphones had a real short cord so this cord is a welcome change i think its ft
i kinda wish that the cord came out of the right speaker but thats just splittin hairs
its good at blocking out most outside sounds when my mp player is turned all the way up which is great cause my house is like american idolpeople singing alllll the time
its so annoying
so i bought these specifically to block them out
for the price i guess i cant expect much more
these headphones are pretty goodsome things i wanna add to this review
the cord is thick
i dont know how important that is but there it is
these headphones are kinda annoying cause you have to readjust them every time youre about to listen to musici have had these for several years and they have been subjected to steady use
im writing this review far far in arrearsthe sound quality is good
its not a legitimate hifi listening experience but for general purposes they are good
the bass is not spectacular
its present but its not what id call deep and rich
the treble is also good but not especially crisp
the sound quality is adequate
if youre accustomed to listening to hifi headphones or a decent home system with a powered  or inch sub this doesnt hold upive had these for several years
they have been used for casual listening on the laptop gaming and to cover my ears while im mowing the lawn
so  a lot of sweat a lot of wear and tear
they are pretty comfortable
this year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off
theres a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover but its going to get gross in a hurry if i keep using it for yard work  lawn mowingoverall these are ok ok sound good durability
they are all plastic and pretty light but hey proof is in the pudding
these have lasted for years of heavy use
the drivers are still good
ive broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability
i cant say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance
obviously it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what i did to these but overall id say these are good
not stellar
not stellar sound
not stellar durability
pretty comfortable maybe bestpossible in that category
but theyre not superior to a highend pair of sennheiser or bose or audio technica headphones
theyre just good
if you want good reliable headphones good sound good durability for  or so this is a good fit for you
if you expect lifelong durability or stellar topend audio quality and wonderful bass this really wont do it for youi picked these up as a cheapie set to listen to music on my phonetablet
theyre extremely comfortable but just a tad lacking in the sound range
i wouldnt recommend them as a primary set but as a backup to go mobile with theyre not bad if you dont mind the sizebut i just cant say enough about the comfort
theyre awesome
i guess ive got big ears because most headphones mash them against my head
i can put these on and they sit around my ears not against them
good and comfortable for long listening periods and while it the cups dont completely block out background sound they do allow you to focus on what youre listening to fairly well in a noisy situationfor a sub set of phones
im happy with themim writing a review on the koss r
first off i had a pair of koss ur
these koss r off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design
the headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head
it has a coiled cord which can be removed
the cord is connected like a phone cardright when i put these headphones on i heard immediate sound difference
i use these on my computer through my audiy zs
very nice strong midbass and low bass
it hits the notes clean and clear
never thought how great these would sound for the price
a very clean sound and strong bass
its also very light
the only thing i dont like is the shape of the earpieces
the design needs to slim the headphones down a bit
for the price this is one nice headphone that will last
my koss ur still work after  yrs of abuse
i just needed to replace them
get this koss r and you will be glad
super fast amazon free shipping also they cover your ears completely and a sit a little tight but comfortable the sound quality is not bad at all for music and videos easy to adjust but no way to lock it  the wire is long enough to put the computer on a table and watch videos without leaning forwardgave these as a stocking stuffer and well received
they were worn during workout and were very comfortable as well as pretty decent soundespecially for the stocking stuffer pricefor the price heck for  times the price these sound great to me
if i were to rate these on sound alone i would put them in a class with  to  headphones
they have great bass nice high highs and are clear and undistorted in most of the situations in which i use them
i could go on for pages about how much i like the sound and how they sound to me like much more expensive headphones
they are open style which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundingsthe fit is good
but the headband is awkward
it consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips
you push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other thereby expanding the space between the earpieces
the system works and feels pretty durable to me but it is clumsy
or i am clumsy
either way it is unusual
but when they are on they stay in place and for ontheear style headphones they are quite comfortable to me
they are also very light as they are very thin not padded except on the earpieces and small
these are actually really good onear headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphonesi think their great advantage is their sound quality
they look and feel a little flimsy but i think they arent as flimsy as they look
but i dont think anyone is buying these for the look unless they are doing it ironically
the quality of sound is the star here
i dont think they sound as good as  headphones but that isnt bad considering the fact they usually sell for around for identical sound as far as i am concerned with a simpler and less expensive headband i suggest the koss ktxpro at about 
it is technically a different driver titanium coated but i cannot hear a difference and i find the headband easier to deal withgood sound would certainly buy another seti just might soon for back up
excellent sound
i have some live recordings and sometimes find myself looking around for planes flyingbut its just in the recording
they might look kind of stupid but they sound great and are very sturdy for work outs
good scorejan  updatestill going strong
use them for my workouts
got that retro starsky vibethese things are fantastic for the price and portability
i bought them because i hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so i could walk and listen to music on my cell phone
very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range
i have always loved koss and these are no exception
recommendedthese are my gym headphonesi am a firm believer in koss quality sound and these babies dont disappoint
they are basically the porta pros but the gymsport version
the lows frequency is strong and the highs are adequate the way i like it
sometimes they can get a little bass heavy but it mainly depends on what your listening too
since i am listening to mostly heavy music i dont have to face the bass issue much but can enjoy the great highs that come with the packageas far as comfort using these in the gym when i first got them was a bit of a hassle mainly due to the fact that i was wearing them wrong
i watched a video on how exactly the headband actually clips backwards behind your neck and tightening the temple cushions to situate the headphones
from that point the comfort level was perfect for me to enjoy these headphones while i work outthe only issue i have with these headphones is the foam cushions start to feel uncomfortable during the end of my workouts
they start to get soggy and make my ears itch while i am trying to finish the last  of my workout
other than that i love wearing them in the gymi bought this headphones for my wife and i have sennheiser hd for home and koss ksc for portable
compared to much more neutral hd bass is a little on the heavy side and treble has a little more sparkle
but these headphones are very enjoyable and quite detailed
the emphasis on the bass is largely due to the part of the headband where the drivers snap into
that round and concave surface right behind the divers amplifies the bass notes quite a bit
i took the drivers off the headband and put them into kscs ear clip effectively making them ksc to see how the sound changes and it confirmed my theory
once off the headband the sound signature became very similar to kscs with a little more bass and a little less sparkle in the high frequency range
then i put ksc divers in sporta pros headband and well ksc became a bass monster
so by switching the dirvers back and forth i can have for different headphones sporta pro ksc sporta and ksc all for less than the price of ksc from koss website
money well spenti wanted good headphones for my mp player and these fit the bill just fine for me
they are the best ive found in the price range and pretty comfortable too
some other reviewers found them unattractive but i dont think they are that bad
id rather have good sound and comfort than cute any day
i like that they fold for storage and come with their own little bag
i am considering getting a hard shell case for them though as the bag doesnt offer much protectionnov
  ive had these little headphones for over  years now and they are as good or better than when i bought them
they are very well made and i have since purchased  pair of portapro phones and a pair of koss earbuds as well based on my love of these
i havent been disappointed yet
i have suggested these to several friends looking for good budget headphones and have heard good things from them as well
for the money you cant beat themi had a koss ksc and it broke so because i didnt want to pay  to ship it to koss to get repaired i bought it new for  i decided to get another version of koss
a lot of people said this has the same drive as ksc so because i like to exercise and play sports and i really really like the sound of ksc i figured i want something that doesnt slip or fall out when i exercise and has similar sound to ksc great sound quality and heavy basswell when i got sportapro the first time i was kinda disappointed because it didnt have enough bass i thought my ksc had more bass and even better sound
but after  months i learned to like this headphones and probably after it got burned for enough hours the real sound came out and i admit that it also has deep bass
the sound quality is already good since the beginingthe only thing is i dont know if this is waterproofsweatproof or not because i sweat a lot when i exercise so im kinda afraid if it will ruin the headphone it kinda defeats the purpose ehpros fits well
comfortable not in ear
adjustability has advantages and i can wear a hat with themcons not good koss quality soundsum good workout phones if you prefer not to stick anything in your ear
recommend but only for niche that it fillsthese koss sportaphones are great
the name is a bit corny comfy on the head in the usual position and in the back of the head settingthey sound very clean and very clean in the midrange and have provide some surprising base notesa great buy the the koss portapro headphones not sportapro have been my goto headphones for more than  years now so when i was ordering a new pair recently and saw the sportapro i thought id give em a try for running
while they almost have the detailed imaging of the portapros they are  percent better in sound quality than my goto running headphones the philips shs
i would give the sportapro five stars except that they arent quite as comfortable as the philips for extended wear
after an hourlong run i felt that the sportapros were pushing a little on the tops of my ears
the headband doesnt really feel secure the down position so ive worn it up
anyway if koss could take the ear pieces from the sportapro and put them on a philips type headband theyd have an awesome sports headphone
hint hinti love koss headhones
i had a pair from long ago and they are not adjustable the way this pair is
i ordered now pads for my earpieces on the old set and ordered this one because it sounded like maybe it would fit better when i wore a hat
while they work as advertised and god knows the price is fantastic as well as the warranty they just arent as comfortable as i thought they would be
when wearing them as behind the neck the padsspeakers seem to slip around a bit
i still like them just wish my head was shaped a bit different to make them a bit more comfortableonly ontheear headphone i have used
very comfortable
highs and midrange are very nice however i expected more bass may be an ear fit issue
i  also expected a more compact foldup
otherwise i am very happy with themwith a name like sportapro i assumed theyd be pretty good for you know sporty things like joggingwhen in behindtheneck position they tend to drift a bit
you have to get the band exactly right since thats the only thing holding them up  the band resting on your neckalso im not saying these things need a manual but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice
theyre a lot more adjustable than most headphones but its not immediately obviousfor the price they sound really good
despite the drift ive been using them for over a year and have no plans on switchingthese admittedly dinkylooking headphones give surprisingly good sound
bass is full and the rest of the frequency spectrum is nothing to sneeze at
since statistically speaking you are like most people youll be plugging these into either an mp player full of badlyripped lowbitrate compressed audio tracks or else a crummy portable cd player with an extremely noisy potentiometer for a volume control
buying better than these perfectly respectable headphones would be a waste of moneythe sportapros fold up too which makes them great for a coat pocket
also the headband can fold in such a way that the headphones look like quotstreetstylequot headphones that are ohsopopular these days
this makes them clamp on your head a bit more but it cant possibly be any less comfortable than any other headphones in such a configuration
i think it looks stupid that way but hey if thats your cup of tea so be itas for noise isolation these dont offer much
if you really dont want to hear the subway along with your gangsta rap you should be looking at a pair of noisecancelling phones or better yet inear headphones such as those made by etymotics
the latter are a few times the price of the sportapros on the bottom end mind you
it even comes with a fake leather bag that i keep laundry money in
keeping a set of headphones this inexpensive in such a bag is just screaming quoti have ocdquot bottom line this is the best pair of portable headphones you can buy for the price
they dont sound worse than the lowend sennheisers in this price range for example and they are quite a bit smallerthey stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym
the foam is a bit coarse so its scratchy
i dont think i could wear them all afternoon at a football game but the bass is excellent great motivator when doing those situps during a  min workout
i would buy them againi love these headphones in behind the head mode especially now that i know the earpieces can rotate
in overthehead mode i find the band a little tight
it works but the earphones barely cover my ears
i have a large head and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in overthehead mode
but ill likely be using it in behind the head mode even when im not outside wearing a hat just because its more comfortablei bought these on sale and took a chance after reading some reviews on them
they really sound great for their size
my main headphones are a set of grado sr which sound amazing but these sound very closethe headband is adjustable
the fit is good if you use the band over your head
the behind the head use seems to not fit too comfortably for me and when i put it on that way the bad ripped a hair out of my headi use these with my gb fourth generation ipod
they have a lifetime warranty and i use my headphones for working out and go through a new pair every  months
save your receiptthey can sound a little bassy but i like that in a work out headphone especially since ipods really lack good bass
excellent for almost any kind of music except classicali do like the sound and the foldup and tuckaway design is handy
i have trouble getting them positioned comfortably when im wearing glasses though
it can be done but its troublesome
i think ill get used to them
yep theyre ugly but we know that from the photo and i didnt deduct stars for thatthese  headphones sound as good or better than many that cost much more
i also think they will be more durable
only two downsides theyre not pretty they dont really fit in the included casestill theyre my favorite portable headphonesi wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head
turned out that when used behind the head they were a little uncomfortable so i use them with the band on top
not exactly what i expected but they are ok and the sound is goodpros bass is amazing mid range sounds like your right there in thegreat pair of phones for the price i believeperformance
high range sounds incredible
feels light and comfortable
keeps you connected with surroundings
comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha i can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear and no pressure from the loudness
just more juicycons a little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head
a little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head
no instructions on which way to wear the phonesstrait out of the packaging i hooked them up to my hdcd denon player
overall theyve got good highs and mids
the khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is but the highend never gets  fatiguing at normal volumes  only when loud
i must say that the bass is  a little exaggerated
it is noticeably overdone in the hz region   the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones
this never seems to  muddle the mids which is often a problem with bassheavy phones
it  doesnt seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of lowend dynamics  which i did not expect
they remind me a lot of the denon s but  without the denons tissyfit highs
when i hooked them up to my panasonic  c portable i was surprised even further
with curve doppelganger the  bass didnt seem even the slightest bit exaggerated
unfortunately when i  moved over to extreme lowend intensive music like massive attack  mezzanine there was still a little too much bass but slightly less than  on the denon
econoline crush the devil you know kind of had too much  bass but most people would probably prefer it that way
yet on many cds  bass is noticeably overdone
spatially the sportapros have a nice open  soundthe sportapros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes  out
when using the headband behind your head the little foldup hook can  start rubbing against my head behind my right ear
this only happens when  the band slides too far down though
all koss had to do was have the hook  facing the opposite direction to avoid this
theyre still the most  comfortable headphonesthatpressontheear that ive ever tried and i do  love how they fold up it returns them to a nice taught shape
the koss  has a good short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute  button on itill keep the sportapros as a portable and bassy  alternative
if used with bass turned down a tad they would be even  betterps
singleentry wires are not superior
they allow out of  phase crosstalk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire  which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dualentry
the  classic sony v for instance has a crosstalk problem and is unsuitable  for binaural applications because of thisi use headphones for running outside not treadmill
i am a big fan of neckband headphones dont use ear buds as i have used sonys discontinued gs and philips discontinued headphones as well
first these are sold to be versatile to be worn as neckbands if you want but they are uncomfortable and are not neckband replacements if that is what you truly want
i wear them over my head and when i put them on the metal pinches my head when it adjusts for sizethe reason i kept them was for the sound
they are awesome
they are more bassy but great for outdoors
even though they are bigger than most neckbands they are still light weight
if koss would get these on a traditional neckband frame i would give it five stars easy
my old sonys almost had as good sound but the neckband and comfort light weight and snug fit over ears still make them my favorite compared to the kossi bought these phones based on the large number of very positive reviews here i just received them and am not disappointedi got them to use with my rio  mp player which came with unuseable koss earbuds the foam coverings fell off every time you put it in your ear
they were also innefficient  not loud enoughthe sportaphones sound excellent  very smooth highs efficient enough for good volume and deep bass
my only complaint is a little overemphasis in the midbass but this can be fixed with the rio s eq settingsthe sportaphones are pretty comfortable although i cant see ever using them in the backofthehead position
the springtype band forces them against your ears which will always help bass reproduction in phones
on the down side this could cause fatigue after long periodsthey fold up quite ingeniously to a very small package and the leatherette bag plus gold connectors are nice extras
i dont know what the fuss is about their looks  i dont think they are particularly ugly and least on my head
i guess if you are ugly to begin with the phones wont improve your looks
in conclusion they are a great bargain for the price
i hope they hold up maybe ill get a spare pair just in casei have bought  pairs of sporta pros during the last  years
nothing wrong with the quality just i like to have one pair at home one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpackit looks fragile and sometimes ugly
but what really counts is the sound
the characteristics of the sound are clean warm dynamic overs a wide range from low to high very good sensitivity very loud at normal volume setting lots of bass although a little boomy at times
the first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass
i hate the mute button but i heard recently koss had taken it off
for protable use its probably the best in its price class
some people complain about the comfortability issue i have no problem wearing it for hours thoughfor more serious listening i would highly recommend a pair of grado sr open style
its about  and i couldnt believe how much pleasure i had taken from listening to it
the highs are crystal clear the bass is good but not boomy at all you can feel it the warm open mid range is simply seductive
the transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing
it stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal classic and pop music
its pity that amazoncom doesnt carry this headphone truely a gem in the protable headphone familyanother pair closed style around  i could recommend is sonys mdrv
good frequency range very good bass very clean sound and very little coloration of sound
however unlike the grado the sound is flat although maybe more accurate
i will describe the sound as scientific comparing with grados emotional and livenessi purchased the koss sportapro headphones to use with my ipod nano
i was surprised with the overall sound quality
the sound responsiveness is very good
the main reason i did not rate them a  is they are not quite as comfortable as i would like
i use them while i exercise and i find that i have to adjust them for comfort long before i am donethe sound better than many portables but a bit bassy with a corresponding loss of treble
still not the perfect phone especially when i am used to the fullsize sony closedear mdrvmdr which emphasize the treble slightly while having the full sound you get from a good headphone
my sonys are also more efficienttheyre louder
ps i wish i could find the cans that came with aiwa portable tape players a few years ago
they were great and you could hear the cymbals dancing clearlythe look somewhat ugly plastic formthe headband can be bent down to go behind your head to keep your gel in style
still stays on
i liked the sonys for this and their great look but their sound was atrocious and they were less comfortablethe pressure the extra pads just above your ears take most of the pressure holding them on your head so they stay on and dont press your ears too muchthe button yes it has a mute button on the cord but its too low at the waistband if youre  and sitting in your chair and when you cross your arms the music cuts outthe plug has a quickconnect regular and mini combo plugthe bag you get a leatherette bag to put them inthe size they close up flat into a  x  area for storageif you are looking for some eye candy with your music or audio then i recommend this eqmeter
it is really alot of fun to watch your music andor movies come to life
it is definitely a conversation starterthat said the audio input and output to analog only
therefore if you have digital audio you need to get a converteroverall a fun purchase if you are looking for a light showi just received my unit  purchased directly from the manufacturer at a better price than amazon
i was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that ive read on amazon but i also didnt want to spend a whole lot of money on my pioneer stereo circa it was easy to setup and connected my cd and turntable within minutes
i was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully i had an turn table amp that i purchased from amazon see that review a few years back connected it and records play wonderfullyi do not have issues that others have reported like i said it sounds great and it was easy to setup
i would say this is a great buyit looks a bit more expensive than just a cheap analog band stereo graphic equalizer
no audiophile quality here just an easy eq solution for your power ampbuying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel againused to have one years agonow use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computerthe equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computerit allows for some sound enhancing along with the computermy child is a black and white photographer this unit was a great gift to produce black and white pictureslike many online reviews and even wikipedia describe this camera the fm is a entry level film camera
still even though it lacks any kind of automation and more important imho a groundglass pentaprism viewfinder extremely important for depthoffield preview with lenses faster than f i believe that this camera is as good as any other slr film camera
furthermore i doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital has a desire for high automation features in such a camera
the fm manufactured by cosina in japan and sold under the nikon brand has a built in lightmeter that requires two small batteries provided with the camera and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens
operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself
since most modern light meters suffer from a  biased factory calibration meaning they would fail the grey card test i am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meters calibration
on the positive side and the right side of the camera the depthoffield preview buttonlever although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f up
although built on a metallic frame the cameras body is mostly plastic
personally i dont think it feels cheap no squeaky noises during handling but i do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces and i will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain mist or extreme cold weather i wouldnt care with a  yrs
old nikon f rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups etc
the camera case although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a nikon camera but again this is not a nikon built camera does provide a reasonable level of protection except maybe for the top edges of the camera where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors
it is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens which in time might create marks or even damage especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera
i would suggest looking for an older much tougher and better built leather case
the lens that comes with the camera is rated one of nikons worst lenses check out ken rockwells reviews for more info but that doesnt mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it
a lens choice is always a matter of personal taste as well as an educated choice for some users
the day i ordered my fm i have also ordered a nikkor mm f manual focus lens a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film nikon slrs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras
i have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the mm much heavier as it is all metal built
for those who are not willing to waste  on a new fixed lens i would suggest the older nikkor mm ais lens
you probably wont be able to find a new one because they dont make them anymore as opposed to the mm above that you can get brand new but you should be able to find one online in very good condition anywhere between  and  depending on the seller
i got one for  in mint condition on ebay
remember the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel
it remains to be seen how the notsohighquality of this camera will hold over time but unless you want to go for one of the much older bulkier but better built genuine nikon slrs then the fm is a good choice for the money even if i consider the lens completely useless thats just me
the reason why i didnt go for an old nikon is because i couldnt find one from a reliable source
all sellers claim their old nikons to be in perfect or good condition most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems
unfortunately the slightest mechanical issue in an old nikon slr is very hard to detect even harder to fix or recalibrate and ultimately renders the camera unusable ie
a slight shift in exposure time
with the money id pay for a defective nikon f rated in good condition and having it fixed id get a new fm a leather case and some lens filters
overall even if i dont feel the same confidence yet as i used to with my old zenit  i am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as i can
i hope this helps you make the right choice for youi ordered this camera for the sole purpose of using it in my blackwhite photo class
and so far i have been able to do everything required with this camera
the lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens
you have the mm setting for to take some pretty good wide angle shots and u can zoom in any where all the way up to mm
its a very versatile lens
some people think this is a beginners camera and while it is a great camera to learn on even my photography teacher who has been shooting for over  years still owns one of these cameras and loves it
the body is not made out of metal like a lot of earlier nikons but that doesnt mean this camera wont last you a good  years if treated correctlybut i do however have some concerns my first issue was that the lens has a little bit of movement up by the focusing barrel
as in its not  tight
im not sure if all lens are like this or if its because this nikkor lens is maybe cheaper quality than other nikonnikkor lenses
its not really anything big but i decided to exchange it and the next one i got was the samealso for a night photography assignment i had to do i decided to shoot without a tripod but instead use some iso film
my instructor said that i should be fine with  because its very sensitive to light hover i found my self only being able to shoot at f and with a  shutter speed
and i did set the cameras iso to  dont know if thats normal or notand finally one thing that was confusing about purchasing this camera on amazon was their very confusing product description that says these camera are refurbished yet when you look at the sellers and their listings all of them are listed as new
my camera appeared to be new but i dont think there is a way to tell for surecommend added in december  this review was written when  megapixel cameras were top of the line and a  mb card costed over a hundred dollars
now the prices have dropped so much that the same review would be more applicable to a  or  mb card
 ainobody would argue that the more memory you have in your digital camera the better
the question is what the reasonable compromise between the price of a memory card and its size is and how to predict how much memory you actually need before you paid for it
i looked up some literature on the image compression techniques and made some experiments with printing out pictures with different resolution and different compression ratios and came to the following conclusionsmost cameras offer a choice between several picture resolutions and several image compression modes
low resolution is good for onscreen viewing while high resolution is better suited for printouts
it is not uncommon for digital photographers to take pictures at a resolution lower than the maximum allowed by their camera although there seems to be no point of buying an expensive highresolution camera to take lowresolution pictures
a probable reason for that is that their camera was shipped with a very small memory card and did not upgrade it yet
unfortunately high resolution images require lots of storage space an uncompressed image taken by a  megapixel camera can be as large as  mb
jpeg compression which is based on an algorithm specifically developed for image compressing helps to store large pictures in relatively small files
specifically jpeg compression algorithm divides an image into squares  pixels each performes twodimensional discrete cosine trasform of each of these squares and compresses their frequency spectra by removing the highfrequency components or by decreasing their accuracy through a quantization procedure
while this review is not appropriate for a discussion of technical details of the jpeg algorithm it is worth saying that jpeg analyzes each small brick of the image individually and adapts the level of smoothingcompressing to the image to be compressed
in fact you determine not the size of the compressed image but the level of its quality the final size of the compressed file varies depending on each particular image
this adaptive nature of jpeg makes it very efficient it takes advantage of the smoothness of monotonically colored parts of the image by achieving great compression ratios in those areas without significant losses in quality and it is also good at rendering sharp contrasts in the image
since jpeg standard was optimized to take into account the specifics of our perception of visual information like mp compression of music files takes advantage of the way how we hear music jpeg compressed pictures are almost undistinguishable from the originals up to the compression ratios of  to therefore a combination of highest possible resolution of your camera with the fine or best compression mode is a good choice for a digital photographer
if this combination of resolution and compression is used a  mb memory card would be sufficient for about  pictures taken by a  megapixel camera or for about  pictures taken by a  megapixel camera
this is equivalent to one or two rolls of film which is not a lot but usually suffices for a day of occasional shooting
hence it seems to me that a  mb memory card is a good buy for the most of usjust the last comment note that there are two types of memory flash and smartmedia
check you camera manual which one you need
smartmedia memory cards are slimmer if i am not mistakeninitially when i bought my creative labs webcam  the button was stuck
but after replacing it i have had no physical problems sincethis package includes a manual the webcam webcam software and some image  editing software
i never used the image software so cannot say much about  it
the webcam software is excellent it includes the regular video and  image capture software but also has a motion detector program
this allows  you to capture images any time someone or anything passes the camera great  for detecting if people are using the computer when your outthe quality  of the camera is great
 x  video capture is quite jerky at about   fps average but at  x  the image is quite smooth sometimes exceeding   fps
the focus is a little dial on the lens easy to adjust autofocus  would be nice thoughthis camera works well on netmeetings and cuseeme  i have had no problems since
by the way installing was quite easy all  the programs installed from the installer i had absolutely no  problemsall in all this is a very decent package
i only once had to  talk to tech support and their service was prompt and helpfuli bought this camera about  months ago and was really excited considering this was my first webcam
it has worked reasonably well throughout this time
the only complaint that i have with this cam is that  when i activate the camera software it deactivates my internet connection
other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user  but also the novice
the picture quality is not bad and for the price you  really cant ask for much more
as for the software it was also easy to  install and to usei found this camera to have a very easy setup and great picture quality
i am running it on a windows me machine and it works wonderfullyi bought this because it was in my price range
the quality isnt great but it does what i need it to doif you need a still or video pc camera for school dont get this one
spend the extra money and get a really nice one
if you just need a pc camera for instant messageing and sharing photos this is a good camerathis is easy to install easy to update online and very very easy to use
dont expect super high resolution photographic excellence but if you want to talk via video chat online take snap shots or send recorded messages this is the businessmore than enough for the avergae computer user highly recommendedthis camera performs excellent under bright daylight
the picture is clear and if you set the contrast right images look great
the only thing i dislike about the quickcam is that its very difficult to set it on a table on top of the monitor anywhere without it toppling back or falling sideways
the round camera comes with a rubber base to put it on
the round camera has something like a metal hook or screw on the bottom and the base has a slit on top
youre supposed to slide the screw back and forth on the slit in order to point it where you want to record but once you get the angle the heavy cable pulls the camera back and it goes toppling to the floor
very frustrating at the least
i found myself moving towards where tha camera was finally pointingotherwise the software is pretty easy to use even though it takes very long to load
i have windows me
you can record videos of unlimited length
ive had so much fun with this thinghey its  bucksroundabout
for that the setup was troublefree and using it was a cinch
but personally i wish for two things that it wasnt colored white cuz it gets dirty real easy
u leave it on top of your monitor the dust collects andalso when i used netmeeting no matter how much i tried to focus the pciture wasnt entirely clear
but again for its price this camera is a sweet deal and pretty cool looking tooupdate  durability is not as expected
after a few months of moderate daily use mp player in my shirt pocket during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail
regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and i dont expect these earbuds to last to the end of the year
too bad since they produce nice soundhad these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on
first tried to use the buds as they were packed  without the little spongy covers over the buds  and was totally disappointed with a loose fit weak midrange scratchy treble and almost no bass whatsoeverfinally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try 
wha
were these the same phones
the buds fit much better in my ears and i had a totally different experience with great mids good treble and very decent bassthese earbuds wont change your life but theyll make your muni commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commutersjust remember to use the sponge thingysi bought these earbuds for my cd player at the time because the ones i had before died on the right side
they were a pair of rca behind the neck headphones i bought at family dollar for very cheap
i would buy another pair but now i have an ipod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable
i was planning on buying a pair of philips earbuds at target because i thought these were dead on the right side and i dislike the ipod earbuds but when i plugged these into my ipod they worked fine
after a breakin session they sound even betterwell they are only ten bucks so what can you expect
not a ton not a surround soundstage and great powerful sound but maybe something that has at least average sound are comfortable and will last a decent amount of time
and thatts mostly what i got with these earbudsthey dont have stellar sound that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about but they have decent sound thats good enough for the money
not a lot of bass but some pairs at this price have barely any bass
the mids on this pair are emphazised but not by a lot props to sony
and they do have a good clean sound to them so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper endfor other aspects of the earbuds they are very comfortable and fit much better than the apple earbuds but feel better with the pads
i have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time
also these are some durable headphones so far and after a halfyear of use they still put up nicelyoverall not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables
already got a better pair
keep these for some useful backups
they dont have amazing sound but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price
 starsnote this is a waterproof version of the mdrelp earbuds
these would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoorsabout a month ago i decided to get some better sounding phones to use in my studio
i bought a pair of sony mdrv and a pair of sony mdr from their prolinethe v sounds fine for noncritical listening but the  shows much more detail
if you really wanna hear whats in the mix the  is the ticketthe v does favors for low bitrate mp encoded stuff and its pleasant to listen towith a bit of a bump in the hz region but theres just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projectsi bought more pairs of mdrthat should tell you something
there has been some talk that sony may discontinue the sure hope that doesnt happenbtw the consumer mdrv is not the same thing as the proline mdr
the v sounds much more like the mdrvinitially bought these phones for home recording
at first they were a little tight on my wide head but after a while they broke in and were very comfortablefor recording i found these phones to accentuate the bass a little too muchhowever for ham amateur radio they are excellent for discerning weak signalsa short wave enthusiast would probably also like these phonesfor the price the best
i have  pair of these headphones for all my various listening locations
the volume control works great and very convenient was just listening to bachs toccata and fugue in d minor with these phonesid say they reproduced the recording pretty damn wellnot excessively bright and just right in the minor classical music phrasesthe phones are plugged into an onkyo tx one of onkyos rock bottom receiversas i type this at ths volumealso been using these with a notebook and a couple of portable playersthey arent difficult for the lower audio output battery powered devices to drivehappy to know these work very well with a mobile phone for listening to musici have a hard time with the earbuds for extended periods they driveme nutsi try to rate audio stuff based on what is being reproduceda preference for listening has always been the best recordings i can affordat times streaming music and other processed audio will be such a disappointmenteven from the best audio gearspent more than a few bucks on beyers akgs and sennheisers over the yearsall of which we could pay homage to yet those dont matter here in this reviewi think sony does a good job of designing and making audio things in generalno complaining hererating the mdrv headphones a great buy in the  rangeif you own these im hoping you enjoy them as i have been doingi got mine in nov  and i have used them primarily at work which is sitting in front of a workstation for about  hours a daymost reviews have been very accurate
these are a bit tight even if you have an avg sized head
after about an hour of listening your ears do pain
i just got used to them and probly they have slackened up over timebut they are even more painful if you wear spectaclesalso the cushion is pretty cheap and really not very helpfulthe sound is decent
from my experience avoid any headphones that have a volume controller since this is the weakest link in the chain
my headphones having finally given up at exactly this point
all in all they served me pretty well for  yrshope they made some changes to the modelthese are great headphones for the money
i have a home recording studio and use these when i play
they are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end
this is one step up from the mdr
the only difference being the inline volume control
these also sound great with my phone or mp playeri do not understand the negative reviews
i have had these headphones for years
i wear them at work for hours at a time and can say from experience that they are comfortable
i really appreciate the volume control on the cord
unlike another reviewer i have had no problems with it
i normally use these with either my computer or my ipod classic listening to music podcasts and audio books
they sound pretty good for the money
they have also held up well
of course they dont sound as good as my more expensive sennheiser phones that i have at home
they are just beginning to wear out so i may be getting another pair just like them as a replacement
there might possibly be better sounding phones for the same price but i can say that these are comfortable and have lasted a long time and sound good enough for most purposes
i dont think that you could do much better for the priceupdatei have had them for about  years and they finally broke
i am going to replace them with the same model
i use these at work and the inline volume control is important to me in my work situation
i can say from  years of experience that they are durable comfortable and the volume control held up well for me
the sound quality is adequate
if you dont care about the volume control feature as most people probably wont you might want to spend a bit more on better sounding ones
for  i dont think that you could do very much better
if you are after top sound quality you probably arent looking at these anyway but i recommend the  sennheiser hd
that is what i use at homethese are a great pair of headphones very sleek and stylish
ived use these headphones for years and they have worked without any issues
the sound quality is not the best but is better than most headphones in the same price range
the extra long cable makes it perfect if you are connecting this to a tv in a living roomthese are better than  headphones and worse than  headphonespros decent sound long cable easy to plug into faraway things great as headphones for the gym if youre not into earbuds
lightweight pretty sturdy and stay on your head well
best of all they dont get too sweatycons after a couple years of light use ear pads will wear out and start shedding little bits of black crud
replacement ear pads cost  to  poor at blocking out external sounds since they dont cover the entire ear
theyd be lousy for office use since they offer no real isolationive had these headphones for about  years and are great for the average casual music listenercomforti primarily use them at work and finally found these that are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time
they are a nice midsized not too big not too small ear cup
they are not over ear cups the padding will rest on your earsbut they are good enough to not be uncomfortable after hours of listening
the band is sturdy and the size does not squeeze on my headstylenice and not overly bulky like the overear headphones
the ear cups swing in and up for portability but they dont fold flat
the cord is very long
i usually keep mine bundled up with a rubber band so its not all over my workspacesoundthese are no bose but given that and the low costthe sound is actually very good
bass is respectable but not earthshattering
mids and highs are clear and seem to sound pretty good from my novice perspective
i listen to all sorts of music and havent noticed any distortion at any range and only sometimes wished for a little more basslooking for good headphones for my ipod i came across these
sound quality to my ears is rather good and clean with deep bass very good for synthesized danceelectronic music or neo soul music which are usually bass heavy but my jazz and rock sounds great toolightweight it fits snugly over my head and onto my ears and in an office or home environment blocks out most of the surrounding sound leaving you to hear just your music
it doesnt block out much subway or airplane noise thoughon the downside the much touted foldability doesnt fold it down to miniscule proportions as id hoped and i find i have to wind up and tie up the m long cord
other than these minor gripes im a happy camperthis is the best headphone i have found for watching tv or listening to voicehowever for music it is sibilant harsh has too much treble
bass is weak
extremely fatiguingi own or have owned just about every high end headphone on the market
overall these are better than most  headphones but both the koss porta pro and sennheiser px in the same price range are vastly more musical lighter weight and more portablehowever the reason i keep these around is because i have never found a better headphone for tv watching or listening to spoken recordings
i can make out very clearly with little strain exactly what is being said
they are quite comfortable and the long cord is niceive been using these at work for  years now
they are sturdy the sound quality is fine for the price and they come with a really long cord in case you happen to be running them under a desk into a pc
these are a great value if you are not looking for high quality sound the price of my neighborhood electronics store bestbuy
that sums it up it would have been even better with a bagi love it
nice sound and noise reduction capability and my friend says the girls them love it tooit got caught in a taxi door and it still keeps on kicking too so that is a plusafter talking to my brother about how much i love my sony mdr s and even letting him try them on he told me he wanted a pair just like them but i didnt have the money to order them for him for christmas my dad went to best buy and bought him these dj vs
while half the price of the s the vs are probably the best headphones that you can get for 
i wont tell them this but i think that the svs and even the sony vs sound better than these and are more durable
however since he loves them and theyre cheap it seems like a good deal for him but after reading how easily these dj headphones break i really dont think these are worth replacing with the same model once every year especially when the s sound at least twice as good and can last several years longerif the vs break every year i may just have to convince my parents to buy him the same model of headphones i ownwhich i saved up for and bought with my own moneythis is a professional dj headphone that is seen on numerous djs even after having been taken out of commission from sony update model is the sony mdrvbr
the ear cups can be comfortably moved around on your ears as well as worn in a way that lets you listen in on one piece while hearing the output on external speakers
they can also be folded in for easy traveling and are light for their size
as for the sound hiphop and house music sounds great although i wouldnt use these for jazz or classical
and although these cans were not introduced as noisecancelling headphones they do a very good job at it anyway
ive used them while traveling on flights as well as on subways and almost never hear outside noise
plus they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable
overall great product for recordingmixing or general listening purposesthe design is by far the best part of these headphones
they are very clean and appealing to the eye  and they fit on your skull like a glove
they seem fairly durable but who knows  they may break tomorrow that would be a conthe sound is pretty clean and detailed at high volumes but definitely distorts at very high volumes especially with the bass upbass is not as impressive as you would hope for this price but bass isnt everything
the fullrange acoustics are nothing short of a amazing in comparison to other the cheap sets ive ownedpros  style fit storage crisp full soundcons  semifragile poor bass tight fit on head distortion at high volumes update december   these havent broken yet  guess they arent as fragile as i though
they still work great and have gone through mild abusenani bought this item nearly  years ago in a supermarket for  eur  when it was brand newtheyre awesome headphones about  years down the road the rubber starts peeling off revealing the fabric to cover the earsthese headphones are quite loud but ohms so theyre not as loud as a  ohms headphones but make up for their sound qualitythey are very neutral phones sounding quite even in the whole register
if youre mainly doing techno and house stuff you might as well go with the much cheaper sennheiser hd not for sale anymorethey have the sennheiser  which are very close to the s
soundwise they sound about just as good little less mids just as loud if not louder just as good lowend crisper brights
i find the senheisers better sounding than these sonys although these sonys sound more linear less crisp more evened out in soundthese sonys are better for overall listening like a variety of styles ranging from classicto jazz to pop etc the senheisers are better for techno house pop dance rb hiphop etcif i can compare these  headphones as theyre all i have to compare eachother withid go for the senheisers because theyre less than a quarter the price of these sonys and overall just as goodif youre an audiophile wanting to get the best obviously these sonys are better but not by much
in fact most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to ab themi was looking for an upgrade from my tinny sounding jvcs
the sound quality is far superior to the jvc and the music doesnt sound like its coming from a tin canmy only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned the comfort
after a little while the phones become painful around the ears
this may be due to the weight or the design
still i will use these headphones as long as they last or i cant stand the discomfort any longeras far as the cost i bought mine for  direct from china via ebay
not badi just bought my second pair
it looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before
i am a dj who loves music and use these for all my work and these have awesome sound
there are a few problems with them however
if youre a dj who monitors loudly and you forget to turn them down after mixing the drivers can and will eventually blow
in addition the round plastic cylinders with the l and r labels at the top of them break and that is why i finally had to buy a new pair but not bad for  years of use and abusesound quality wise if youre not a dj there are better headphones out there
if money is no object get the bose quietcomfort  headphones much better and filters out all the sound around you
but if youre a dj these headphones are a must
ive talked to hundreds of other djs and they all have bought the denons technics pioneer and other brands of dj headphones that cost the same or more and they have all told me that those headphones do not hold up as good as the sonys did
too bad the dj headphone makers dont take note of this and make a better quality producti tested this in sony showroom and even in the noisy atmosphere the sound quality was too good with big noise reduction due to the closed cups
so i ordered one for myself and one for my friend
the products arrived in good conditioni started testing it with many of my audio and video collections both from my laptop and mp player and the sound quality was top notch
like many other reviewers i too heard several new sounds from the same old songs
the bass is excellent and at the same time high end instruments are also heard very clearly
excellent purchase for the pricing about  from amazon with free shipping except for the below issuebut then i found an issue with my head set and my friends one too has the same problem
it is the clicking noise which i can clearly hear in my ears when the cup moves if i move my jaw or my ears involuntarily
and many times i hear that even when i move my head but not all the times
this is fine during music but too annoying to me during movies
i have a good sized head 
and there is no play when the headphone sits on my head
it is having a very good fithavent seen others writing about this
can anyone share their opinion
mine are just  days old and i am worried if this will increase over period of timereally good set of cansvery good overallall genres
these things need power to perform at there best amp hungry
they are not my ultrasone pro  or pro but they make an awesome set for a family set headphonei just want to echo what a lot of reviewers have saidthe sound is absolutely first rate
music no longer feels like its around you youre part of it
bass sounds absolutely crisp and clean not muddled and washed out like some other headphones ive used
highs and midtones are well represented
pretty much perfect for any sort of music be it electronic rock or classical
i used to game with these headphones on my pc as well which completely spoiled mebut like others have said wear and tear seem to plague this pair of headphones
i dont dj but i do use my headphones on a regular basis and my first pair eventually formed cracks near one of the earpiece joints which was the beginning of the end
my second pairs demise was my own fault having fallen asleep with them on and somehow twisting them in just the appropriate direction to break off a jointother than the joints however im pretty happy with the ear pads
given the amount of wear the pads have held up quite well where other cheaper headphones have eventually fallen apart due to heat and perspirationcomfortwise id rate them a  out of   they feel pretty much like what they look like
part of the great sound is because they pretty much cup your head pretty snugly and feel pretty comfortable for the first several hours
however after an extended period your ears are ready for a break from being mashed to your head
i dont rate them too badly on this mainly because there are other similarlooking headphones which are pure orture compared to the sonysif youre looking for comfort i would suggest the bose triport headphones which sells in a similar range or the more expensive quiet comfort  which adds noise cancelling
although i cant speak for wearn tear ive tried out the triports at my friends place and i currently own a pair of qc mainly because i needed noise cancellation for workrelated reasons and these two pairs of headphones are unmatched for comforthowever for pure sound i preferred the sonys by far
ill probably pick up another pair of these sonys soon because writing about them make me miss themso my bottom linepros sound  my favorite sounding pair to date by far portability  they fold up nicely and come with a travel pouch comfort  reasonably comfortable for extended periods durable ear pads sound sound sound sound sound soundcons quick wearn tear on the plastic joints so careful with twisting the earpieces too much high price for such fragilityfor such an pricy pair sony should have constructed these headphones better but at least for me the sound is definitely worth italthough they come nowhere near the calibre of highend sennheiser headphones the mdrvs perform admirably for the amount of money they cost
the highs are crystal clear the mids unmuddy and the bass is pretty good although i personally found it a bit underpowered which is why these receive only four stars and not five
perhaps more importantly these headphones are extraordinarily comfortable and fit snugly around your ears making them ideal for home use and extended listening unlike the vs which are designed to be used during live dj performances and therefore be worn mostly over only one earif youre an average home user looking for a great set of headphones to listen to your mp collection or your big booming new dvds with these are the ones for youi first bought the sony mdr v over a decade ago and was so taken by their performance that i invested in the v a few months ago
i have not been disappointed
if you are looking to combine your digital music listening experience cds mps etc with a top notch pair of headphones or looking to enhance your movie watching experience on a laptop for example with a state of the art pair of headphones look no furtherthe highs and the lows are captured perfectly adding a hithero unknown dimension to your listening and viewing pleasure
you certainly cannot go wrong with the price eitherbe warned however that these headphones are heavy
while not a problem should you be sitting in one place and listening to the audio by no means will you be comfortable walking around in these headphones
hence the four and not five starsthe headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes jetlag lethargy but if you want a better audio experience buy the sony mdr v headphones
they are a little less cuppy on your ear but the sound is far superiorcomfy to wear sound great sturdy enough
wrap around the ears nicely to keep ambient noise at a minimum keep the good smooth highs and round bass in
about the same as the vs i had for  years but more comfortablei had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears
there was no way to adjust the headband so it kept falling off my head
i got irritated so i just returned itsound quality was pretty good but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about thisthese are the best headphones u can buy
i got them put them on on the way home and couldnt believe how amazing the sound is
i have had nearly every headphone been searching for the perfect headphone and i just found it
they look really cool use only a trickle of power for mp players and give u great sound that covers youre ear unlike earbud or anything like that
with these you get very very clear distinguishable sound from headphones that are light as a penny
they are as comfortable as wearing a hat and you bearly feel they r even on
it is definitely worth the price compared to price headphones that break in a week
and i get price a week so i value money alot
buy these headphones
they dont distort music they just give it to you with awesome clarity and precision
they sound so much better than even my awesome sony speakers
editi wrote this review many many years ago and apologize for the awful grammar and spelling
i still own these headphones and they still sound great but after becoming somewhat of an audiophile i have noticed that these emphasize treble and bass
they sound very punchy and clear because of this so  of people will love them however if you want to hear music without any extra bass or treble you will have to get some more professional oriented headphones from sennheiser or the very well known sony modelsthe headphones are well made but as with most headphones the first thing to break down is the ear pads and head pad covering
after so many years of use the pleather material has seperated from the inside of the ear cups and head band
this does not interfere with comfort at all but they dont look as nice as they did when they were new
that said the drivers still work great and sound quality is what it always wasi lent these headphones to a friend who was a fan of rap and other music that i dont listen to and he refused to give them back for  weeks since he liked them so much
if you dont mind getting headphones that are many many years old but still sound great for most ears these are a great choice
please disregard my previous review i was just happy to find headphones that sounded decenti ordered these after buying several supposedly decent pairs and returning themi love these
the sound is so clear  they sound great even turned up very loud they have the capability to go much louder than i could ever stand vocals are super clear while the subtlety of the other instruments and little bell sounds and stuff on the tracks can be heard very well
nice bass alsoi am like the princess and the pea when it comes to comfort and these  things are super comfortable
i can hardly feel them
i wear glasses and other headphones pressed my glasses against my head which hurts these donti dont think they mention it in the product description but they do cancel alot of ambient noise  my phone just rang and i totally did not hear it with these on my head
soooo i highly recommend thesei am an audio newbie and for me these sound great
i know that one can always spend more money but these worked just fine for me but only for about four years
the lefthand side of the headphones just fell apart
one day they were working fine the next they break on me and become unusable hanging by a single cord
i didnt use these every day but only on occasion
i would have thought that theyd have lasted me  years but i was way offi use these for djing and have run them for several years
the only thing that i had happen is the thin covering over the earphones and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces
i finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because i would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes
since i use them in loud environments i cant really comment on sound quality
they do block some sound a little less now that the covering came off which helps in loud areas
the cord is coiled and long it has stretched out over time so its really long now just make sure you dont wrap the cord around the phones tightlyive been reading  reviews where people talk about wearing out these  phones and buying a second pair
i bought a new pair of ear pads from sony on line for less than  including sh and tax
just as good as newi purchased this headphone last december  i went through a number of headphones before getting this headphone
i have used koss headphones and sennheisser headphones
the cheaper  earphones i bought would always break down on me
headband would snap or the quality was just getting very poor
i went to a local music store and decided to take a dive into more expensive headphonesi purchased these headphones without even listening to them
i asked the clerk to recommend a good affordable headphone and he handed me these
i bought them and had my mp player in hand to test these out
immediately when i tried these headphones on it was a world of difference
they feel extremely comfortable and lightweight
the sound is real crisp and clean
these headphones sound beautiful with almost any sort of music
the only thing this headphone lack would be stronger bass
everything else from mids to highs it is very nice
i can wear these headphones for hrs straight before my ears start hurting
this headphone even comes with a cool leather carrying casei ordered two different headsets from amazon so we can have one upstairs in my office and one downstairs where my other half works when he works from home
i just took this one out of the box and so far is working as it shouldive been a fulltime telecommuter since november  so i am on headset most of the workday all week long
if you dont need background noise cancellation and you prefer overtheear with boom microphone to stickitinyourear buds    then this is a very good reliable bet
a quick and easy mute switch  volume control is essential for conference calls and this design is perfect for thatin november  amazon said this model was currently unavailable so you might have to find the new model numberthis is the most comfortable headset ive had  really love it
it has volume  mute controls  i can wear it for long periods without any discomfort
the only reason it doesnt get  stars is it just doesnt last long
i think it is in part that the cord gets yanked a bit here  there catching on something as i move about perhaps pulling connecting wires
ive tried other headsets that are not anywhere as good and dont last either
i just pay for this as i need it  accept it as the way it isi have been using for daily for one week with a mhz cordless home  office phone
when my old headset died i actually tried a cheap  brandx replacement headsetmistake
returned it and decided to try the mythic plantronics namepro excellent sound quality sending and receiving all day comfort in headset mode
have actually forgotten to remove it a couple times already useful control features mute receiving volume and sending output volume good industrial design  ie
cool looking  mike boom is not too longcon concerns about durability
the cable thickness and lack of robust strain relief looks like a potential for sudden failure
considering this the top of the line i would have expected better from plantronics value paid  locally
cost more than the phone itselfif it lasts awhile i expect to be a happy customer
for  on amazon i see little downside and probably no better product for the intended usethe sound quality is the best of any home headset ive ever used
i bought another brand at a radioshack and it sounded horriblebut the manufacturing quality is bad
it only lasted for a year before it broke and i had to buy a new one i guess thats how plantronics makes extra profitsproduct arrived in time and worked successfully
it came with no documentation although it was fairly easy to figure outfinally i have found a headset with a mm plug which actually works and with which the folks on the other end of the phone can hear me
i bought this for my corded office phone not a mobile or cordless phone and it works great
i really wanted a headset with the mm plug and this is the only one i have found which works well enough for me and has adjustable mic input
not sure about durability yet
quality seems okay cord does seem somewhat thinit is nice that it gives the option to use either over the head or over the ear
the padded speaker cover is comfortable and will not wear out like the foam kind
i used the switch to turn the the mic on and off a lot and has made it much more useful to memy only hesitation about buying this product was that while the bluetooth and other wired devices keep getting smaller and sleeker this one looks like something from  years ago
nonetheless i recommend it and would buy it again because it gives the best sound quality of the devices ive tried its very comfortable i dont like ear pieces that hang onto my ear for support and it has volume and mute controls at a decent price
when you find a good price i recommend buying several so you can keep one in each car one by each indoor phone i use it more for handsfree indoors than with my cell phone in the car and because they will eventually breaki have hearing aids so i needed one that just laid on the ear
this works fine even with my ipadi love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece
the sound quality is great and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason i bought this
the mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt
the only reason i give this  stars instead of  is because i have had a lot of people tell me i sound somewhat distorted when talking on it
usually i can make it better by adjusting the mic volume another nice feature or by moving the mic away from my mouth
overall good purchase for the moneyworks fine we have bought multiple models of plantronics headsets and due to rough duty in my wifes purse they all eventually fall apart
but while they survive they work great
have tried ear buds ear canal blue tooth etc but keep coming back to this style plantronics for overall functionalityi purchased this headset for use when on the cell phone
the sound quality and way it fits is excellent
the headband could be a bit sturdier but i am careful when expanding or shortening it so i think it is finevery good headset
the first one was damage due to improper use
but this is a headset that we use everyday for work
 hours per day on averagenot perfect but very good and excellent rangei bought this headset to plug into myphilips voip pcfree dect  wireless ip phoneandphilips voip  skype dual phone single handset  voipg to let me call into teleconferences whilst still having my hands free to typepros compatibility worked without issues with both my cordless phones features the headset allows adjustment of earpiece and microphone volumes which allows the headset to be tweaked to work optimally for the phone and user
also having a mute switch on the cable control module is very useful audio quality incoming voices come in loud and clear and ive never had any complaints about my voice being unclear comfort i wear this for at least an hour at a time and have never felt uncomfortable wearing it
there is the usual adjustable headband the microphone boom can be moved and the earpiece can be worn on either earcons a version with two earpieces rather than just one would have been preferablei bought this for its durability but the sound quality was pretty lowpoor volume was low tooworks exactly as advertised
great for conf calls at home to keep hands free
mute button works great
use it on my home cordless phone and my blackberry with no problemsthis is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard plantronics quality ie
very good
the mm jack means it wont fit on some mobile phones this is smaller than a standard headphone jack but for my blackberry its great both  and pearl
as a bonus i also use it with my xbox  controllers both with the attached messenger keyboard and without for online gaming
some people have observed that i sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless xbox controller but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes itthere is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug but this doesnt seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversationits held up quite well over the past few years being stuffed in bags and traveling around
its not as cool as the wireless headsets bluetooth etc but it doesnt take batteries doesnt have to be recharged and isnt subject to interference
ill buy it again ifwhen this one finally diesi purchased this headset because my old plantronics headset fell apart
i do like this headset but i have been told that people can sometimes barely hear me when i am talking so i have to move the mouth piece a little closer which sometimes causes my ear piece to move away from my ear
overall i am please with this purchasei have had no trouble at all with this headset
by the way i recently bought a panasonic kxtca headset and its almost exactly the same but a few bucks cheaper
the difference is that the panasonic does not have a microphone gain adjustment switchnot many sources to buy floppies these days got it to copy dos software for old application on virtual machinethe labels included are of very low quality wont stick and got caught in the reader had to be removed with a tweezerotherwise it is what it is  floppiesthey work just fine i forgot how slow and noisy these are
packaged well and shipped fast not really much more to say about themthe floppies work just fine for storing data with vintage music gear like the yamaha ex or akai sseries samplers
the only negative is that sony is kind of stingy with the labels  they are only half sizeconsidering the price of smartmedia cards these days im tempted to buy a few boxes both for my own future use and as an investment
there is a lot of seara music gear that relies on floppy disks
workstations samplers grooveboxessequencers etcwhen i saw recently in sonys online  store storesonycomovertheheadcatcatidalloverheadheadphonespgidmlmcdxxpsrpbcrnskmuleoxrvsidjapquxlcbdvjozrjotabkkkasjjtlj that the mdrv headphones have been reissued as new in  and that amazon is an authorized dealer i ordered a new pair to back up my original made in japan v cans that ive had forever as a recording engineerthe current ones are made in thailand and the box carries a  copyright
the new  version sounds close to my excellent japanese originals that i used for monitoringmixingmastering in my recording studio
evaluated using original lossless digital masters from my recording studio as the source and measured against my studio reference akg austrian made ks i find the new v are not as well balanced across the audio spectrum as the k headphones
the  v has a noticeable boost in the low bass  educated guess about db or db centered broadly around hz  making them a bit less suitable for studio work monitoringmixingmastering than the ks and about db or db higher in the low bass than my vintage mdrv headphones were when new
the  v has excellent mid and high range reproduction has very good image placementsound stage and no audible distortion but does not  reproduce the low end of my master recordings quite as faithfully due to the low bass boostthe fit of the new v for me is snug without being tight or uncomfortable
leakage is minimal if at all at anything less than levels that will damage hearing and the isolation from external sounds is very good
fitment is good and the stitching on the leather headband is well done
but physically they seem just a tad different somehow
the originals have the feel of solid construction
although the new ones look to be put together well they just dont give that same sense of being as solid and durableearpads look like the pleather thats been problematic in the past for flaking
another minor gripe  the cable of the new headphones was so tightly packed into the box that the coils are deformed in several places  but i was able to get the cable back in shapeso ive knocked off one star because of my subjective feeling about the physical qualities and being a bit less suitable for studio monitoringmixingmastering than the akg ks
id have to determine exactly where and how much low bass needs to be eqd down to use these as highly accurate reference cans
that shouldnt be with headphones billed as studio monitors and its a departure from the signature of the original made in japan v headphones which when new were essentially flat over the majority of the audio spectrum  db between hz and khz as true studio monitor headphones should bethis  version of the v is still very good for home listening enjoyment they also sound darn good with my samsung galaxy s smartphone but some may want to turn the bass control down a bit about db or so on the sound source
consider looking elsewhere if you need a tool to do critical highly accurate analytic studio monitoringmixingmasteringgreat soundvery comfortable i bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older sony seti bought the older sony from ebaybeware when doing thisit was a fake sonybought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the sony mdrv was inferiorthe fakes are hard to detectthere are web sites that go over ways to checkthese headphones sound wonderful
they are a very faithful reproducer of audio so youre hearing what the people who made your music or moves want you to hear  not what the people who made your headphones want you to hear
i love that i can listen to dance orchestral rock rap or basically any style of music with these
the other neat thing about these headphones is that theyre standard equipment at nearly every studio ever
so youre more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music usedthe simple fact is that these headphones blow  beats and other designer headphones out of the water
they just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bassone drawback which might just be a personal thing theyre too narrow for my head
i could just have a wide head but i feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head
i realize that this is partly necessary for good sound keeps the earcups seated on your ears but i feel like it could be toned down a biti have heard problems about knockoff mdrvs on this site but this isnt one of them
build quality is very good
sounds amazing my first pair of real cans
my parents had just bought  pairs of bose oes for  and both agreed that my cheaper vs sound better
my only complaint is that the bass runs a bit thin for my tastesbut it is actually pretty accurate
these are not the bassheavy beats that sound best with rap music and not much else the vs sound amazing with everything from classical to rock to rb to soul to primusmy iphone s drives them good enough to not need a headphone amplifier but of course i still want one lol
be forewarned though these cans reproduce the sound so accurately that now poorlycompressed mps now annoy the heck out of me
i can even hear the difference between my kbps aacs and my lossless alac files
i finally had an excuse to rerip a bunch of cds into kbps aac andor alac nowvery comfortable even for hours at a time
i want to try the velvet ear pads just to see how they are but the stock ones are still very comfortableif youre on the fence and you dont need a huge bottom end these wont disappoint youi am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound i would definitely recommend these
i also have sennheisers at the same price and i felt sony this was better than those head headphones
they are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem
they look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packinggood set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded
if you want something for recreational music listening these might not be for you thought i dont see why these couldnt be used for that
these have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etci just bought these trying to save a little money over the mdr
i have used the  headphones for probably  some years now replacing them when the earcups started to break downthis is my third set
i listen every day to speakers and headphones
i now have both models and can compare them
in my opinionand please no hate mail i think the s sound better
they are slightly clearer and produce more air if you know what i mean
bass is good on both but once again i think it is slightly cleaner with the pro phones
one writer mentioned about the gold plating wearing off of the connector
i plug my phones in and out all the time for years and the connector still looks perfect
no wear at all
maybe that coonector has something to do with the sound difference
i dont know but if i had to do it all over again i would spend the extra money and buy the mdr  dont get me worng
the v is a good phone but for my ears the other set is the way to gohello this is my first review for the sony mdrv with ccaw voice coilsoundfirst i would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing
ive had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble but for me its very well balanced
the only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges
some people mentioned about a boomy bass and i disagree
i think the bass is completely fine i still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though
i like bass a lot and i put my ipod with bass boost and it still sounds fine without being boomy or vibrating i listened with my galaxy s and that sounded fine as wellcomfortsome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable
for me it was pretty comfortable but not as comfortable as i thought
at first its going to hurt the top of your head for a bit but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortableness goes away
right now after  week i dont complain about the headband at all
just like any other overears it does get sweaty a bit so dont wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time pbuildthe build is pretty solid but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap but its not much to complain about
its well built overall and its portable which is a plus for meaccessoriesit comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in which is pretty nice and unexpected
also it comes with a  screw on
problem i had with this screw on is that when i took it back out for whatever reason the  connector bent in the middle slightly maybe because i screwed it on too tight or something
i just bent it back with the  adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fineotheranother thing i noticed was that the cable end doesnt really fit well into my s when it has its case on
i have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in
because its also with a metal endwhich makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one i sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s
but if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in
i wish the  was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldnt have to be shoved inpros great sound quality
for the most part balanced its actually quite comfortable once you get used to it its portable it has the coiled wire so it doesnt tangle so easily it comes with a convenient  cable
i use it for my p yamaha digital piano it doesnt squish your ears but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones solid metal endingcons high range in treble can get screechy but thats if you go really high it is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head the wire is a little bit too long the metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the ipod or your phonetldr its very good product for headphones under i just picked up a set at frys at lunch and agree with the others here that they are comfortable and sound very good
unfortunately the soft earcups are very susceptible to any little noise source including movement of eyeglass frames and touchingscratching your cheek
i really wish that stores would have headphones on display so that you could find things like this out at the store
i also think that the earcups will get hot and sweaty with extended use
so far the bose triports are the only units that i have found that are comfortable and dont create this noise from rubbing but i dont particularly like their sound plus they cost twice what these doi like these headphones a lot
its been years since ive had overtheear headphones and theres no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds
these are like being in concert
the mdrvs have a nice neutral sound meaning theyre not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be
the cord is coiled and doesnt detach from the headset
so for those who want everything to come apart these wouldnt do it
i use them primarily to listen to music when im using my computer and sometimes when im playing something i havent heard in a while like yes i just have to stop and appreciate the music again
wonderful experienceim listening to linda ronstadt singing someone to watch over me as i write this
the sound is clear
there is no overbearing bass just enough the high notes sparkle like nye champagne and lindas voice is wonderful fantastic
the headphones dont get in the way of the musici ordered my sony mdrv on november   sold by amazon and received them monday december   with free super shippingthe reason for my purchase of this is because of the large amount of positive reviewsmy initial reaction to this headphone was ouch because it has a higher response to treble than my last headphoneand what it has excess in for treble it lacks in bass
i really expected more bass i can even crank up the lowerband of my eq and it still hasnt got enough kick to my likingbut after a few days of listening my ears adaptedmany people believe there is a headphone burn in but i believe this to be personal hearing adapting to the soundthe sound is okay its nothing mindblowing my sentry cd headphone which cost far less sound just as good as this if not betterthe reason i say if not better is because the sony mdrv has a quiet but noticeable hissing sound at all timeseven when there is no music playing my sentry do not exhibit this qualityin fact i would rather have purchased sentry cd again instead of this my expectations were too high due to the overexaggerated reviews of othersthe sony do have better isolation than the sentry but i am not worried if others hear my musicthe clamping force is not as tight as desired or expected many of the reviews claim its too tight
this was another factor in why i made my purchasei wanted tight headphones because the tighter they are the better they sound
this headphone slopes down and the band rests uncomfortably on the top of my headallinall i am not completely disappointed in this purchase the sony mdrv headphone does sound good but it is not as other exaggerated reviews would have you believevery good sound and base
relatively comfortable but do tend to squish my head after a whileonly real complaint is they bleed sound
you ever sat net to someone that had their headphones not blaring but still a bit loud and you could really hear them clearly
yeah i dont like that either
ive owned other big headphones like this that did a good job of sealing in the music so that everyone around them didnt have to listen to it too
these dont do that
the sound is great for me but my wife complains all the time that theyre disturbing herother than that good headphones for the pricenote these headphones are in every way the same as the mdrs wellloved headphones for studio work
even the replacement part s are exactly the same
so this review is for either one i bought bothanyone who has been listening to music on normal street headphones will be blown away by these
the first thing you notice is how soft and comfortable they are to wear  the earcups surround your ears leaving no pressure on the ears themselves
then when the music starts you notice background noise is blocked out bass is full and punchy not muddy boomy or distorted every detail shines through the music is loud for the given volume settinghere are my comments on these four aspects background noise is blocked outbecause these headphones surround your ears and are closed back they really do diminish outside noise
its nothing like the bose active noisecancelling headphones though  these ones just turn down the volume on outside noise rather than pulling the plug on it
this is on purpose  many headphone designers feel that active noise cancellation discolors the sound too much bass is full and punchy not muddy boomy or distortedthe drivers are big on these and the ccaw coils let them draw power when they need it without getting muddy
if you do hear distortion its probably that your player cant dish up enough power so try switching to a good amp
my portable cd players works fine though and i hear ipods do too every detail shines throughthese headphones are really detailed meaning they reproduce high mids and trebles well
you will probably hear things youve never heard before like breaths guitar fretboard noises and string instruments
however this makes you feel like youre right in the middle of everything and it can get tiring after an hour or two the music is loud for the given volume settingthe impedance on these is lower than most headphones which means that for a given voltage these will draw more current and hence sound louder
however power is power and your battery only has so much of it
so these dont necessarily extend battery life they just give you more options for how quickly to use itfor comparison i also own the sennheiser hd  pro and   all are more soothing less bright while retaining the detail
the s dont match the bass or noise dampening of the vs
the pros dont have quite the same bass still great
 are much less comfortable but block noise better and sound sweeter
the s are superior to the vs in every way bass accuracy sweetness comfort except that they intentionally dont block out noise at all and require a good amp to sound their best
plus they cost almost twice as much as the vs
in summary youd be hard pressed to find a better priceperformancecomfort balance than the vs
try the hd s first for classical or instrumental music they only cost  so trust me try them
 but if you want noise dampening andor punchy bass dont hesitate to grab a pair of thesei bought the headphone a week ago
and i have no luck with headphones these seem very good 
costly but  is a great value
here are my thoughts they  look well made
the  weight for the headphones is not as heavy as some may think
i use them for hours dailyi even walk around with them
being a women i dont like heavy weight
so i find the weight good
the ear pads are very soft also replaceable  which you cant do with some
the fit is an over the ear they look kind of big but dont let that fool you
i am a women with small ears  they fit nicely 
the cord is one sided  and thick
it also looks like a phone cord i wish the cord was replaceable 
i dont think  i will need to replace them 
the length of the cord is longer than others 
that is great for me because my cd player is on my book case near the couch
the sound is great even with the volume at low  sound
you dont need to put it that loud
the balance of the sound is well balanced
can fold them  which is great for draws
lets talk pouches soft well made  with a drew string
i like pouches in my opinion 
i hope this helps you make up your mindi am very pleased with the sound of these headphones
it is detailed and wellbalanced across the frequency range
i am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable
i cannot comment on thumping deep bass because i listen to the wrong kind of music for that
i bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member
this newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as goodon sound quality alone i would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning
pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart
the old pair extended smoothly
i dont know if quality has gone down or i just got a wonky pair
since i can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality
i havent had any other similar issues so farextended frequency response for harmonics  thus sound is crystal clear
also bass response is excellent
very comfortable on the head and ears
this phone does not eliminate ambient noise nor is it designed to do sobeen kind of interested in adding another set of headphones to my collection
mostly used for mostly music playback and some pc gaming
these headphones fit the bill
at their price how can you beat thesesound these have a great sound
just so you know where im coming fromive been married to my bose triport headphones that i bought years ago
i paid  for those
compared to those soundwise theyre about even with the edge going to the sturdier sonys
the sound is excellent at the bottom mids and highs
i found the sound level to be even accross the sound field
very flat
but flat in a good way as these can produce very good lows mids and highs
not any one particular range dominated which is perfectconstruction is without a doubt excellent
these things will take a beating
the cushions are comfortable
i have a huge head and i found these to be fine
not tight or uncomfortablethe only ding against this fine headset is the cord its long thick and heavy
not very portable
i wish there was a way to mod the wiring to put something like what bose uses on these then these would be perfect
i believe a different version of this headset has a more portable wire
mm jack is not compatible with iphones bumper case
carrying case is thick and cheap lookingoverall if youre a headset aficionado i think you will appreciate these
a fine headset to add to the collection
pass on the beats by dre save money and enjoy
updatethe cord was really getting to me so i cut it
big mistake
i was hoping to just splice the wiring and make the wire shorter and manageable
when i went to cut the cord and strip the ends i found these very thin wires
i believe they were l channel r channel and ground
well when i went to touch the ends together and test i got no audio whatsoever
great just killed a perfectly good set of headphones
well long story short i was able to solder the ends together insulate the solder with electrical tape and fix the headphones
worked like a charm
i wouldnt recommend this to anyone
i lucked out
i thought this set was cooked for surewould have been  stars but after hours of wearing my ears are sore
do i have big ears
maybe
the cushion is a half inch thick until you put them on
then it compresses down to about  which makes the speaker portion press against my ears
the sound is quite good not the best ive heard but suits my purpose which is for editing music
the bass is a little heavy for my taste but more closely resembles what i hear from my room speakers
highs are decent
the response seems reasonably flat  at least i can hear almost all of the highs except the really high highs such as the hiss from the electronics
quite lite and comfortable but not as comfortable as i would like them to bei wasnt looking to spend too much so i found these
the reviews were great and theyre comparable to beats and other high end sets
only knock is that the coil isnt detachable and the bass isnt that great
but overall after a month of use its the best one ive ever hadarrived reasonably quick
this headphone is from the last generation agewise
it has better quality than many current more expensive namebrand models by different manufacturers
good sound quality for the money
however i have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented
my son loves it and it doesnt bother him
he is using it all the timeok let me start off by saying that i did a lot of research on plenty of headphones before i chose to buy the sony mdrv headphones
i was going to choose the sennheiser  until there were several reviews saying that it doesnt go well with an ipod
anyways these headphones are really good
im currently into eight hours of breaking it in
when i first opened these headphones and plugged it into my computer and i was extremely disappointed
the sound quality was almost exactly the same as my cheap  headphone and the sound was ridiculously brighthigh treble
i was ready to return this product until i thought to myself i needed to break it in first to really judge it
after six hours of breaking it in the sound quality changed dramatically
i mean i thought i was listening to a new pair of headphones
right now it is sounding great and im currently at eight hours of breaking it in
there is still bright sound but not has horrid as when i first plugged it in
people that have these headphones are suggesting thirty hours
i really recommand that everyone breaks in these headphones first before listening to it but i dont recommand this product for people who dont like bright sound and people that are looking to sugar coat their current musici love these headphones
the sound is superb
bass treble etc its all super good
in the airplane they are just about noise canceling
the only beef i have with these is they are a little loose on the head
ill take it though
i have used them with a droid phone and i dont think they are quite loud enough sometimes
however that is just the phones issue i betgot these earphone today and was impressed by the quality of the materials
i was a little worried however by the exposed wires connecting each side of the earphones
these earphones sound very good with solid bass and overall clarity
they did seem a little harsh on the high side but were very comfortable to wear
while i like the overall sound of these earphones they are not quite as smooth as my jvc hadx earphones which i consider the very best i have ever heardi have a hard time finding headphones that fit nicely and feel comfortable for long periods of time  due to my large head size
these headphones not only sound terriffic but they are also very comfortable
super soft covers on each ear piece and the stretchy cord is a nice touch too
this set feels good in your hands and on your head the quality is obvious and its a well made product
i used these on a long set of flights recently and was able to watch many hours of movies and tv shows before i started to feel any discomfort while wearing them
and that is really saying something
i highly recommend these for general use even if you have a large heada relative bargain when compared to fashion lifestyle headphones
the sony phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones
the ear pads will fall apart after a year or two so expect to have to replace them
this happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad
this isnt unique to sonyi have been a headphone fanatic for thirty years and have owned and used a variety of headphones over those years to include stax sr sennheiser hd and hd
the sony mdrv excells as the best value of any headphone that ive ever owned
they are especially good at producing naturalsounding deep bass and the overall octavetooctave balance is excellent
the sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably morethe mdrv is especially wellsuited for travel due to the collapsible design and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by openback headphones would distract othersthe mdrv is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from beyerdynamic
the pads that come on the mdrv have a nonbreathable cover and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone
this forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable
i read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads which eventually come apart with a velour pad made by beyerdynamic and after i did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad the increase in comfort was so great that i immediately did the other pair
the thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad which is considerably more comfortable
i can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones
even if you dont replace the pads with the beyerdynamic velour pads i suggest removing the pads anyway then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surfacethese headphones are great but i could have saved  if i just kept using my panasonic rphtfs stereo headphones instead of looking for a better pair of headphones to buy
also these sony headphones have the heavy coil wire which gets to be a little uncomfortable
the heavy coil wire makes it feel more tense as if the headphones are being pulled off your earsthe sony mdrv produces superb sound across the entire spectrum
unlike some of the other reviewers i do not find the lows stronger or weaker than the midrange and highs
the set is comfortable and the cups insulates noises well not to compare to noisecanceling headphones
all that said i still feel that the set should cost at  lessi agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc
excellent product on its ownbut this is not for someone who loves bass like me
i ended up buying another extra bass sony xb which is much more bassyfirst of all id like to say the packaging is very nifty with the red velvetnow second the sound
at first when i first tried it it sounded weird on my film soundtracks because i wasnt used to it but after getting used to it i wondered what the heck i had been listening to with my last headphones
these new headphones make songs from a month ago sound too goodthird the the ease of use is flawless except sometimes when you take them off and put them back on you might have to spread the earcups out as they like to be togetherfourthly is the comfort
i was thinking of giving this a four star but decided not to
the reason why was because the coil
yes the coil
that long cord
if you late it hang down next to your chair it sometimes causes to send a beat back to your headphones
not a sound but you feel it and its annoying so i try to keep my wire on top of the desk
i might coil it up later when i feel like it
other than that its perfect except it does kind of block out sound so if someone is calling you forget it lt loledit after over a year of usethe sound quality is great
sometimes the wire can get in the way because of its weight but if you keep it on the desk which is really easy to do there is no problem
the earpads are comfortable too
but there is a problem with this device
despite its pros the earpads arent very strong and replacements are even worse and harder to put on
the earpads that came with the device lasted  months
this is good
however replacement pads i bought didnt last long at all  months usually one or both earpads
ive had to buy like  replacement pads
i admit i might not be putting them on exactly right which i intend to take every precaution when buying a deluxe version pair but still the internal gradual ripping of the material covering the inner foam just keeps happening
like i said when i get the deluxe pair i will try my best to put it on perfectly but im still hoping for the besti dont really want to write a long review because i am not the biggest audiophile everi just wanted decent headphones for a decent pricei will say these are just about worth exactly how much they cost
the sound is amazing
everything sounds amazing and it has the perfect amount of bass and treble and with minimal adjusting im sure i could make whatever changes i wanted to make them sound betterbiggest complaintthese headphones are ok to wear for an hour of use but after that i find my ears in horrible pain i have to adjust where they sit on my head cuz it really does hurt i dont know why they push so hard against your head
i usually wear a hat when i listen to them because it delays them hurting for a whileotherwise they dont like like incredible qualityfor the sound they are incredible
but i wouldnt get them again cuz they hurt so muchif you are looking for comfortable listening then these might not be the bestbut they sound good and block out a bunch of soundok i have had this unit for a few monthsat first i thought it was a revelationthe most realistic flat and detailed unit ever herdthen i realized that the mids are slightly recessed andthe highs were fatiguing after extendid listeningso as revealing as these units are they are not the end of your journey on headphonesi myself still have them but end up using the audiotechnica es as the es is just the bestfirst the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful
they are not boomy but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs and everything in between sounds equally as nice
the cord coils nicely and doesnt tangle entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other endthe funky mechanics that i refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband
the headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones
i also find myself being overly
careful when collapsingexpanding the headphones but maybe thats just my paranoia considering the costthe sound quality is without par in any headphones i have ever had and i would definitely buy another pair if these dont fall apart mechanically within the next couple of yearsi had always been using junk monitor headphones before i decided to upgrade to a serious set of cups
i decided on this headhone after comparing it to the  pro vs amplification and suitability for all kinds of music
for someone who has never listened to high quality cups before it took some getting used from the boombox style sound i was accustomed to before
in the end i bought the ozonemp izotope plugin for winamp to get the sound profile i liked
the v needed very little amplification compared to my previous maxell hp studio monitor headphones
i was able to pick up sounds i never new existed
unfortunately for someone who listens to kbps mp a lot this meant a lot of noise pops and clicks in the music
this was mostly bearable when the music is in full swing but stands out in the silent sections of the music or really poor quality recordings
the same would be bearable in the maxell but without claritythe headphone tightness around the ear hurt a lot when used more than half hour
i salvaged the velourlike ear pads from my previous maxell studio head phones which fit the sony like a baggy pant
but what a huge difference and relief to the ear
the headphones are still tight but much more bearable
its almost a must that you change the ear pads and consider that in the true cost of these headphonesthese sound great
one star removed because a its easy to knock the cushion off the earpiece and very difficult to get it back on and b the curly cord is a pain  it gets knotted up on itself easily and is generally in the way
a straight cord would be bettervery good headphones
more bassy than my grado sr headphones which are in the same price range
however these phones surround the entire ear which accounts for some of the additional bass whereas the grado phones sit on the ear and allow for more soundstage and in my opinion more accurate sound
the sony phones shut out much more of the room noise than the grado phones do because of their sealed design
the grados dont shut out any room noise at all by comparison so if you listen in a noisy place you may want to go with these sonys
these phones are good for editing djs microphone usage etc
they are fairly comfortable
much more than the sennheisers i tried on not as much as the grados
however i dont find any headphones comfortable reallycant complain
these have good sound at a very reasonable price
they do lack a bit in bass for my taste but i am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected
i did almost have to max out the volume on my mp player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier
all in all a good buynot as much bass as i thought
but its not supposed to i guess
just for the studio to get true sound
i need bass headphones thoughlike many here i did a lot of research before purchasing the v
i considered the  but i usually take good care of my electronics so i didnt want to pay the extra  for it
anyway i just want to write a review as there are some questions that i wished were answered before purchasing
before i start i want to let people know that this is my first over the ear headphone
i always use earbuds due to it portability
i run with them so the v isnt ideal in that situation
okay now the reviewthe productit is very well made no cheap plastic parts
the wires are long and good for sitting in one place to listen to your music esp from a receiver
if you have to walk around while holding your portable music player like my zune hd then it can be a handful to hold bc you will need to carry the cord around along with your music player
not a big deal but just a heads up if you are looking for something a little more portable and manageable
i have been using this for a couple of days now and the earpieces hurt my ears after an hour of use
people said it will get better
i only hope so but i bought a beyerdynamic replacement because i heard it is more comfortable and that it will make the music even better too
i also heard the original earpiece wont last very long
my other complaint of the original earpiece like others have stated is that my ears get warm after  minutes of use and becomes sweatythe musici have used  sony earbuds and  klispch earbuds before and i have to say that this definitely sounds better
the lows are deep the mids are excellent and the highs are very clear
the biggest difference between this and my other earbuds is the clarity of the music especially the vocal
i dont know if the earbuds small single driver or its proximity from inside the ear canal that is causing the sound to be muddy but this over the ear headphones make the music sound more natural and clear
i used to love a lot of bass in my music and i still do as i listen to trance often
if you are looking for a headphone with booming overpowering bass then this might not be for you
i was a bit underwhelmed by the loudness of the bass when i first listened to tiesto or hip hop music
i am not saying that the bass isnt good it is very good very deep
its just not eardrum breaking
p
for alternative pop and other music that emphasize vocals and a dynamic range of bass and treble this headphone performs brilliantly
you can hear all the different instrument being played very clearly
it actually made me fall in love with the vocal of one of my favorite female singer
 if your mp conversion isnt great then you can hear all the crackles and static
i dont know if that is a good thing or bad
one thing i noticed is that i needed to turn up the volume a little more compared to my earbuds to hear the music on the same loudness level
i think perhaps portable music player like my zune hd requires a bit more power for the headphone compared to earbuds
i usually listen to my zune hd at level of  but with the v i listen between  i love music and this headphone has taught me to appreciate it even more
i have learned to love the quality of the music now and not just the loudness of the bass
as for noise cancellation it does reduce outside noise by about  imo but there is no noise cancellation passive or active
you can hear outside noise without music turned onupdate after a month of usemusic still sounds great
only problem i have is that the earpiece is so uncomfortable
they press against my ears and hurt a lot after an hour of use
it also gets very sweaty too
please keep this in mind before deciding your purchasethese headphones have been around a long time
there is a reason for that
for the expenditure these are very hard to beat
the tonal balance is nearly perfect with perhaps a slight boost in the bass region
they are easy to drive so even a smart phone gives decent sound
however with a dedicated amp they are incredible
i strongly recommend these even if they have a coiled cord
in fact i am buying two more sets to use as giftswell it is time for an update on these headphones
the sound quality is still great
however i started having an intermittent problem with the right side not having any sound
the problem progressively got worse and now there is no sound from the right side at all
this occurred after relatively little use
i have not decided whether to attempt to repair them or simply buy a new pair
i am removing one star from my review for this problemnot that the  is better or worse
these have samarium cobalt magnets and the response has more of a smiley face to fool you into not noticing the roll off on both ends
the  with neodymium magnets has a flatter midrange but the lack of extension is more noticeable
to repeat both headphones lack extension but one doesnt try to hide it and the other does
some people find the  brighter overall
two different flavors of otherwise the exact same housing  driver design
the nickel or goldplated jack has no real world difference
you might get a little more corrosion on the former but the latter will just wear eventually anyway
samarium cobalt and neodymium both have their benefits
neodymium is stronger and doesnt significantly lose any of that strength over time the sound might be more stable but samarium cobalt puts out a more even magnetic field and is more heat resistant
the fact that the weaker magnet on the v is preferred by some people might mean the aging of the magnet may have something to do with the tone people rave about on their  year old set
neither model has outstanding bass response or distortion characteristics
pick your poisonthese headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable
i use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound
they collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch
the cord is a bit short but otherwise theyre greati bought the sony mdrv monitor series headphones to replace my beyond redemption sony mdrv headphones that have been resoldered numerous times and krazy glued more time than i can count
the only thing missing was duct tape
regardless they were about  years old and when i couldnt find replacement ear pads i had two extra sets i new it was time to replace themanyway after doing a lot of research reading one review after another until i was going blind i decided to by the mdrvs
price was a big consideration and at  and having very good service with the mdrv this became a logical choiceive only used the headphones for about  hours and im very pleased with them
some reviews mentioned a weak base and i agree but tweaking the eq corrects that well enough for light jazz and rockabilly i go back to early days
however ive found that listening to classical especially baroque the mdrvs shine
unlike others i dont have a problem with the treble
ive found it to be very clean for lack of a better word
one thing i did find out very quickly is i have to knock the volume down another  db
these headphones are very loudas far as comfort goes well sony missed the boat
i dont find them to tight but the headband is lacking padding
if you have hair on top it may not be a problem i dont
the mdrv had excellent padding and i salvaged that padding and attached it to the mdrv with a bit of scotch tape
looks weird but they at least they are comfortable nowi did knock off a star for the comfort level but the rating is   i think they are an excellent buy and the sound is also excellent for my type of music others who need heavy base may be disappointed
finally they ear pads are very soft and comfortablereally love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones
they fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them onpros the audio is good once you burn it for  hrs the build looks solid that will last yearscons heavy and uncomfortable
it presses hard on ears so you cant listen to for long timei returned to to get more comfortable ones even though i got these ones at very good price  from amazonim no audiophile but i have been an amateur musician for the last  years
these headphones are an excellent choice for the price
comfortable fit brilliant highs booming lows and middy mids  also very good ambient noise blocking
even with no input i have to take them off to have a conversation
overall  just another really great product from sony
you can get much better cans than these but not at this pricethe quality is what you would expect of sony consistent and well made
i also am a bose enthusiast but i was impressed with all the specs on the sony digital headset so i thought i would give them a try
i was not let down they fit good comfort is good and the sound quality is very goodafter moving to guam i cannot find any decent audio store on this island
highend audio store is out of the picture here
i decided to switch to computerbased music system and a pair of good headphone fortunately i am not addicted to highend hype
by doing some homework i found a very decently priced audirvana plus for aiff playback
however i still need a pair of decent headphone to complete my macbookpro  audirvana plus music playback system
please believe me you do not want to have too much  stuff in your apartmenthouse on this island otherwise you may find them all gone when you go home
that is why i target on a pair of headphone less than again going on the internet doing some google search i found this sony mdrv
ok the following is my  week impression on mdrv fresh out of the box it sounds a bit harsh and i felt sound fatigue after about  minutes of continuous listening
but this is not the problem at all
i ran in this headphone by playing music into it continuously for  days and the sound is much better now
i am expecting it will keep improving after about  to  months to have both drivers settled
will update about this part later the sound of this headphone is like what they are designed for
almost no colorationbefore writing this review i saw two extreme ends of reviews
most people were using this pair of headphone for years and some reviews are cursing sony mdrv the story may very likely be that sony has discontinued this headphone in japan and the replaced model is mdrcdst v was the cdst
in japan all vs are actually  imported
sony actually moved the original production line of v to china and later to thailand
since i only own this headphone for one week i really are not in the position to judge the qa of v
mine v is printed made in thailand on the box
maybe few years later if i still remember this review i could provide more info about how long does mine v livegot these for my teen who is a budding musician
he says  these headphones have okay mids and amazing lows
they can hurt your ears after a few hours of use from squeezing but its not that bad
i use them for music production and music listeninghe would recommend themthat pretty much sums up the audio dynamics of the incredible sony mdrv headphones
the reviews ive read on the web that mention reduced midrange are pretty much correct
i just didnt know having small sounding not tinny dead centered in your head lead vocals would be the result of it but it is
same thing listening to dvdsand this may be due to the different ways certain audio is recorded because kenny rankins vocals on his because of you cd sounded live and real due to it being recorded live in a hardwood floor concert stage and in the words of chesky recordsusing minimalist miking techniques and without overdubbing or artificial enhancement to ensure the purest and most natural sound possible
another cause for the somewhat echoless disembodied vocals is the sound dampening foam within the ear piecesother than that if you like clean accurate bass right down to near earthquake frequencies the vs will deliver with amazing clarity and with very little distortion
as an example about  minutes into propellerheads on her majestys secret service during a quiet violin interlude there is a barely audible low resonant bass frequency that doesnt reproduce on my home theatre system with vented sub as well as off my sony earbuds and other audio equipment
the v plays it perfectly without overpowering and muddying delicate detail
and open ranges gunfight battle the most realistic ive ever heard in any movie sounded exactly as it did in the theatre on the vshowever some live sounding jazz quartets like the ones recorded back in the s may loudly resonate very low upright string bass frequencies depending on how it was recorded as it did on some julie london songs
it had me reaching quickly to adjust the bass on my  sansui a amp before my ears bleda noticeable hole exists in the upper midrange that creates that slight bass hum in human vocals talking on a mic is quite evident on the vs
but thats what they were designed to do anyway and probably the reason why theyre favored by radio djs and announcersbut hey nothings perfect but for the money these are the best sounding headphones ive ever heardonly had these for about a week and so far only listened to them through a laptops  in jack using one of  itunes streaming radio electronica stations  kbps
these phones sound great
i feel like i am there in gayfms club
im not gay but thats none of anyones business anyway
the headphones come with a built in  jack and a comes with a  adapter
the coiled cable is great and stays out of the way
so far comfort is ok a little snub but not uncomfortable
i have big ears and the cup seals fit around my whole ear
i havent worn them for longer than an hour so i cant say about comfort longevity
the bass is surprisingly full and highs are crisp
i like a thick bass sound and i sampled one of itunes kbps electronica radio channels
the bass sounds incredible through these
the earcups flip over  in case you need to use them like a dj
i never owned a fancy set of phones before so i cant really make any comparisons
i like to think i have a pretty distinguishing ear and my ear likes the sound from these headphones
you get a great sound for the price
i had the studio mdr model in my wish list for about a year then saw these at a discount price so i went ahead and got them
the wider freq range sold me i dont know about audio features but sounded reasonable to me wider is better
i havent had a chance to try each side by side so i hope i made the right choice in going cheaper
so far i am satisfied until i hear a better sounding modelthese are very comfortable headphones and have a nice long cord to wrap around your work area
as for the sound the highs are great but the mids seem muffled and the bass is lacking the a deep sound that i prefer in the housereggaedance music that i listen to
also you will find your ears getting a little sweaty after prolonged use with any over the year headphone
overall a great pair of headphones but definitely not the amazing set i was hoping for after reading all these other positive reviewspaid  on amazon
bought these for my dad for christmas along with an mp player
very good sound quality
picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable
definetly recommendedi was looking for some good headphones for my desktop pc
these are very comfortable and the sound is pretty good as well
the physical quality of these headphones are very good as well
i use these all the time
the black material covering the foam ear pads is starting to tear at the base of the speakers
i will have to buy replacement foam pieces in the future but the tear has not propagated so i think they should last a while longer
my ears do get hot after wearing them for awhile but that just shows a good seal around the ears i suppose
i would recommend these headphones even though they seem to be a little high in price perhaps given how long these headphones have been aroundi have used these headphones for a few months now and i felt it was time to finally write a review
i have used them for listening to music watching videos and playing computer games
the audio quality is very balanced and if anything the sound feels a little light or thin but if you add bass through an equilizer it will come through
they are extremely comfortable and i can wear them for long periods of time
i was impressed at first with how much they also deaden any external noise too
the cord should be long enough for any setting and the storage bag is nice enough
overall i dont regret this purchase at all and i would recommend them to a friendbought this item for use at the office at my cube
the sound production is very good
ive only tried it through my phones music player using high bitrate mps so not exactly the best source so im not going to dig too deep into sound quality
ill just say that i am happy with the sound productionon the comfort side the cups are pretty comfortable
ive repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears
the only slight discomfort i experienced was from the head band
i wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head
as it is the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile
but that could just be the shape of my headin terms of manufacturering the product feels quality made from the band all the way down to the end of the plug
overall im happy with the purchaseit has been ten years since i purchased this camera and it is still working wonderfully
sure these days my main camera is a  megapixel with x optical zoom and a staggering amount of features but i still look back on my old hp c with fondness
it was after all my first digital camera
it also captured many many many memories over the decade
my old hp c still gets used these days as well
i use it for rugged outdoor activities that i dont want to expose my main camera to
its fully decked out with all the accessories that were prohibitively expensive or did not even exist in   mah nimh rechargeable batteries  mah nimh eneloop lsd batteries mb cf and even that then prohibitively expensive ac adapter that i paid  for
nostalgiathe picture on the sony is clear as a bell and very easy to see even from several feet away
my only reservation about the set is how high i have to turn up the volume in order to hear it
this may be a function of its  sitting under a cabinet in a corner of my kitchen but i really need to  crank it
it also doesnt mask the static if i turn my satellite receiver  off before the set my other sets do
however i like the set well enough  that im considering getting another one for my upstairs bathroomthe sony tcm pressman desktop cassette recorder with automatic shutoff is a pretty goodmaybe even very goodtape recorder in this price range
i like the fact that it takes the traditional old fashioned type of tape recorder and improves upon it
we get features like a microphone jack a headphone jackand theres even automatic shutoff for when we cant be there right at the exact minute the tape stops playing
the handle also makes for easy portability this can be used to record just about any sound
words music lectures and conversations you name itthe buttons are easy to read and understand theres practically no explanation needed for the five or six buttons in the front of the tape recorder that handle features including play fast forward and rewind
the pause and eject buttons work reliably too
great
just as amazon notes there is also a builtin microphone and speakerbut if you want a very clear voice recording there is a microphone jack so that people can get a very good recording of their thoughts right onto that cassette tapeit even comes with an ac adapter
if you need to carry this around and you cant plug it into an electrical outlet just use the four aa batteries youll need for roughly eight hours of usage
of course if you use strong batteries you may get up to nine or even ten hours usage i think eight hours is slightly too short for what youll get out of battery usageone thing i must tell youas im sure you can imagine this isnt exactly the worlds most durable tape recorder
after all the price is very good for people in all income brackets
what does this mean
it means that i wouldnt bang it around or let small children play with it unsupervised
if dropped it could well break and that would be a shame
handle with care for the maximum life of this tape recorderanother caveat although they say it records lectures well im not sure just how well it will be able to record a professors lecture unless youre rather close to the professor when they talk
this occurs simply because its not capable of picking up voices and nuances of words from larger distances
i will have to take off one star for this to make this a four star review
believe me i tried to use this for my continuing education spanish classes and i was disappointed
i was not able to get a consistently clear recording of what the teacher had said
good thing i took notes just in case this failed me on that score
one way to possibly get around this is to ask the teacher if you can place the tape recorder on their desk while they lecture maybe that will work if your teacher doesnt mindoverall this is one fine tape recorder for everyday use and less demanding tasks like recording your own thoughts
it records especially well when you use a microphone that plugs into the machine instead of using the built in microphone
if youre looking for a good tape recorder in this price range and you dont need extremely heavyduty features this tape recorder is for youfor  what a deali write songs and play guitar and its handy to record the music at the momentsound  quality as expected is mediochrei did  record a financial message from my speaker phone panasonic handset
very good
this alone justifies this recorder
i will have to record from this to a digital hand recorder to check out the qualitydigital is not everythingbut almost
lolthis device does what it was intended to do record and play
it has performed adequately as expected
i havent gone wrong with any sony product yetif you shoot low res pix only x youll get about  pix out of this memory stick which isnt a bad amount of pix but it also means you are shooting low resolution
if youre only taking pix for the web thats great and this memory stick will get you pretty far
but if you are hoping to print your images out youll want to shoot higher resolution which means the mb memory stick isnt quite big enough if youre hoping to go out on a trip unless you buy a few of them
i recommend at least a mb memory stickas with all sony products this is of course well made and solid and works like a charm
just make sure you know how much memory you need and then buy more alwaysthe  stars is arbitrary
this is no top end table such as rega
but for the price it is decent and i have found the speed to be steady
most of my music playing is cds
i pretty much only buy vinyl music not available on cd
if you are an audiophile who plays a lot of vinyl this is not the table for youa nice playing turntable simple in design easy to use  a real treat if you have some lps that are nice scratched
i have had this for several years it always works
put in a sure cartridge nice needle not the cheap thing it comes with
hook it up to a nice receiver yamaha  and some infinity speakers love vinyl wow a blast from the past is good hey i have an ipod it is not the same  happy trailsthe sony ps lxh is a good entry point into the retro world of good sounding vinyl if youre tired of  somewhat mechanical and less than open sounding cds and other digital formats
this turntable is totally manual
cool if you dont mind tweaking the table every so often
the unit itself is pretty heavyabout  poundsand very solidwhat you want for full sounding analog
the pitch control works great once you get the motor adjustedoverlooked in the so called owners manual
the  and  motor speed adjustments are on the bottom
the supplied cartridge sounds pretty goodagain once you properly align itanother point omitted in the manual
if you overlook the sparse info in the manual and take your time setting it up youll be rewarded with a surprisingly good sounding system
if you can get this table on sale you wont be disappointed
dont forget its not and doesnt pretend to be the equivalent of a thorens music hall rega or other high end unit
the bottom line is this table is a good sounding good dealpurchased a sony pslxh to replace  yearold technics belt drive turntable
the sony appears to be one of the few reasonably high quality options for an audio as opposed to quotdjquot turntable in the sub or even sub price rangeif it runs as long as the technics will be quite a buy  for now this must be considered a quotpreliminaryquot report
outofbox picks looks good amp matches other sony components in system appears to be solidly built amp comparatively heavy goldplated rca plugs with removable cables a nice feature
 although cables themselves do not have gold plating they can easily be replaced builtin strobe wslider pitch control plattermat combo appear higher quality than technicsoutofbox nits gee manuals have gotten cheap looking amp provide sparse information
where is the overhang guide
cheap quotnonamequot cartridge conical bonded diamond not properly mounted in included headshell overhang  alignment guide would be helpfulnotes this is quotmanualquot turntable you lower amp raise the tonearm manually
not as nice as quotsemiautomaticquot where you lower but turntable raises at end of lp
manual is ok for active listening  but you wont want to forget about a playing lp
at least the arm lifter works well  smooth in operation amp easy to controlit also has an quotsquot shaped tone arm which takes a standard mount cartridge
pmount might be more convenient but there is more choice avail in std mount  plus i have two fine cartridges each mounted in own headshell will use the sonyprovided cartridge to play really old lps  childrens records
 and can use existing overhangalignment toolthere is no built in phono ampequalizer an issue for many modern home theater receivers
but you can buy an offboard unit at moderate cost if needed
how does it work
just fine thankyou  using one of my existing cartridges played parts of several lps amp was rewarded with crisp sound amp no obvious noise at realistic but still moderate listening levels
may not sound any better than the old technics did at one time but speed control appears spot on amp songs sound as they quotshouldquot subjective of course
controls all appear to work with precision and strobe marks are easy to read  adjust
two nits here minor startstop button can be hit by mistake  but care should avoid  more irritating antiskate control is poorly marked you basically just ballpark it if setting between whole numbers
tracking force instructions are not intuitive  at least compared to technics  but if youve done before will pose no problems
these last two items are only of significant concern if you plan to switch cartridges on a routine basis alas something i traditionally dooh yes the unit is taller than my technics so much so that there was no hope of using it with the supplied dustcover
unit is placed inside a cabinet so cover not needed in this case but might be an issue if your space is tight and you must use dustcoverbottom line only the poor markings on the antiskate control are truly disappointing and then primarily because of usage within cabinet and personal preference of changing cartridges on a frequent basis
cabinet location makes antiskate setting doubly hard to confirm if you can view from directly above ballpark will be very close but placement within cabinet calls for flashlight amp mirror will have to work in this
the balance of the unit seems to work fine and certainly sounds fine  which basically means that it doesnt add noise  speed inaccuracies nor otherwise impede working of selected cartridgeto that extent it is all that one could hope for and looks good to bootother units considered included new technics belt drive music hall stanton gemini amp several others at least quotlooked atquot everything i could find in the sub range  though budget never called for exceeding 
if you eliminate the cheap quotimpulse buyquot models  which includes some brand name items such as the entry technics  and draw a fairly strict upper price point say under  there are not a lot of choices left
now specify standard mount cartridge and focus upon basic audio performance and controls  as opposed to quotdjquot performance amp controls  and your choices really narrow
the sony pslxh is arguably the best among those that remain although differing priorities could yield a different alternativeneeded a us extension cable so i could extend my iphone charger
the outlet is on the floor now i can plug one end of this cable into the chargeroutlet and leave it there then loop the cable behind and onto my desk and plug in my charger
now my charger could reach my phonedesk
works perfect to extend any usb charger
only gripe is the price
wish it was a tad cheaper hence the  starsgood quality cable feels durable works as described
well made
good buy
the price is also acceptable as well
not quite sure if it is usb  or  will check when i get backfirst of all i the cable i got does not look like the one pictured it is a more plain looking usb cable end
the construction is solid and it usually works on most of my devices although some of my friends have trouble getting their phones and ipods to charge when it is connected to a wall adapterother than that it is very convenient to be able to move around my room without leaving my phone by the wall to chargeextension for gaming console duty
replacing a worn out extension cable these seem to only last about a year or so before they get flaky
rated one star short because the female end is not overmolded could have sworn the image showed that when i made the selection
still a good deal and its a brand name cable
will probably buy more in a year or sounfortunately this cable is too long to carry a power charge sufficient for a usbpowered external hard drive or to use as an extension to a car charger for a phone or ipod
it also will not be compatible with a powered usb hub either  i havent tried it with an unpowered onehowever its useful for peripherals such as mice and keyboards at leastdue to my computer setup i needed a usb extension cord
i shopped many stores in my area and the price was  either of monster cable also known as the i am a yuppie and have too much money burning a hole in my pocket brand or of indeterminate quality
i was not going to drop money in that range for something that might have cost fifty cents in china to make and i was not going to enable a corporation like monster who i feel is fleecing consumers with technological snake oili found this cable from belkin a very reliable company
the insulation  connectors are high quality
the wire feels of a decent enough gauge to last many years
this is a real value for money purchase
if you need one you are not risking anything buying this cablei deducted one star due to the fort knox like clam shell packaging of heavy duty plastic that you will have to attack with a box cutter to free your purchase
if they has a security pull tab to make retrieval of the product easier i would have rated this a full five starsgreat price and good quality belkin is always dependable
the length is perfect for some temporary work areas and i have used it many timesokay it works finedoes the job is a good value for the money i would recommend it to anyone needing one better than the storesworks greative purchased several belkin cables and they always seem to be well made
only problem with this particular cable is that it is not usb  which i didnt realize when i bought it
i had intended to attach it to another cable which i purchased at the same time
according to the instructions it is not advisablethe mistake was completely mine
i just didnt think to check for usb  when i purchased itits your standard usb extension cable
quality was very good then ends were molded for durability
time will tell how well its madesometimes you might wonder you know the usb cable that came with this cell phonecontrollerhard driveother things is not long enough i could something to extend its reach
i know where you are coming from and i figured you would consider something like this
here i bought one heres my take on thingsthe cable came in a plastic bubble tightly coiled around to fit in as small a plastic bubble as it possibly can
the color is a little darker than you would see in the picture but then you are not buying this because it looks pretty
and it might look darker due to my room lightingthe build quality looks quite good
while it does not have anything fancy like a woven sleeve or builtin led it feels as though it can handle years of service
you can see though that the female side of the cable is not very protected in fact it looks like a mutated male part
it is sturdy as well trust me but it would have been better if it were protected by the plastic that surrounded the lower part of the connector
it might accumulate more debris and dirt than it would otherwise but i have not used this long enough to go through such an endeavor and live to tell the taleit works marvelously in conjunction with shorter cables
i had a sixinchlong a to mini b cable which worked very well
i also had a foot cable of the same kind so i tried thatbut the cable did not let the signal go through
there is a label on one end of the cable cautiondo not exceed ten feet of total cable distance on lowspeed device or sixteen feet on high speed devices
this was usb  hard drivea high speed device
sixteen feet was maximum length allowed and this cable itself is  feet long so any moderately long cable is going to strain the signal that tries to go to and from the deviceit is a great product but it puts a lot of the cables suddenly to the edge of usability
i would recommend its use with shorter  feet and under usb cables
otherwise you might be better off getting a shorter extension cable or an active usb cable liketripp lite u usb feet certified active extension cablebought a new computer where the usb plugins were at the bottom and my logitech camera for skyping no longer would reach my monitor so this fit perfectly and allowed me to place the camera where it once wasi have needed usb extentions but they are hard to find and too expensive when i do find them
they cost as much as a dvd player lol
this is a good product at a fair price get  you can use them in a  placesokay its a usb cable but it is  foot long
works fine and allowed me to move the printer further away from my computer deskthe product is great and handy if your are trying to extend the cable of your usb devices
good built quality and easy to use
fast shipping as usual from amazongreat price and works very well
great price and works very well great price and works very wellgreat price and works very wellwhen i received my new camera i was using a borrowed pc
i did not return the later right away cause i wanted to do a little test to prove if the ccd system was truly that differentmy wife asked me what i was doing to which i answered quotlets see if i just overspent our moneyquoti used the same tape to film our newborn baby with both the pc and the tvr at the same position
what were the results
my wife said quotmake sure you do the rest of the filming with the new onequotthe pc had darker areas you could see the interlaced video shadows and a whole other bunch of things i dont know the terms to cause i discovered them when i saw the same picture filmed with the trvit is a lot heavier than the pc bunch from sony so go for it only if you are looking for nearprofessional results instead of conveniencei stand by most of my old review but after using the epic a bit more ive found that the spot metering is a good workaround for some of the cameras shutterpriority programming
put that spot meter to careful use and you can get more depthoffield and less flash use
also after days of heavy rain recently here in california the weather resistant features are nice too
this camera really is a great valueold reviewid suggest finding an old olympus xa in good condition instead of this mostly preprogrammed technocam although it does have a sharp lensand its very small and light too
but the autofocus is a little touchy and it wants to shoot at f in any kind of even slightly low light
with the xa you can choose any apertureor iso
you want and the lens is even sharperof course you might have to use a tripod too but the stylus epic wont really acknowledge that choicehowever within its parameters its a slick little camera and you really shouldnt have to pay too much for it refurbished ones go for under i have recently rediscovered film photography and have aquired this famous point and shoot
film is still a great affordable option for high quality pictures if you scan your negatives
plus without an lcd to worry about how the last picture looked i can focus on taking the next pictureright out of the box the size impressed me it is one of the most compact mm cameras ive ever seen in person
only a canon elph is smaller but thats basically a rectangle
the stylus epic is one of the best handling cameras ive ever touched
modern digitals are mostly rectangles but the stylus has a great tapered design that feels great in your hand
the shape is also perfect for sliding in your pocket
the sliding cover is also the onoff switch so theres no odd buttons or switches to slow you down
on top of that loading film couldnt be easiermy main concern is that the camera is rather loud when it advances film so its not exactly a subtle camera but otherwise i am glad i picked this upupdate having just developed a few rolls i am very impressed by the optics of this camera
just a generic  speed film yielded pleasing results but i noticed some quirks
first of all due to the rather wide lens you want to get up close and fill the frame but the lens cannot focus closer than about arms reach
not much of a problem for most situations but closeups arent really suited to this camera
and then there is the flash yikes
if you can avoid it and you can with fast film and a steady hand do not use the flasha good pamps very nice design
does tend to overexpose by stop
lens is actually a little wider then mm mm
lens sharpness is good for a pamps but does not compare to good slr optics like nikon
cameras operation has some idiosyncrasies like how you get to spot metering mode the fact that the focus is driven solely by the indicators in the center etc
the date stamping is a little too small and too close to the center of the image
redeye is a problem
the viewfinder is very tiny and has severe distortion
overall a good but not great little cameraif you can spend more get the yashica t wzeiss lensa couple things pros   i have dropped my olympus d several times and once i slammed it in a car door in its case
for some strange reason it still works fine
you can get an mp player that uses the same type of memory card smartmedia buy a  meg smartmedia chip and reformat the card  for either device when the occasion  calls
a  meg card can hold either a couple hundred pictures or about an  hour of music
the floppy adapter works well to transfer files tofrom  the smartmedia card and a usb smartmedia card reader works even better
however downloading data using camera and serial cable is quiet an  frustrating process batteriy draning time intensive etc
cons   start stockpiling aa batteries now especially if you really like using the  lcd screen instead of the viewfinder this isnt the kind of camera  you can whip out real fast and and take an instantaneous photo
it takes  about four seconds from when you slide the cover open to when you can snap  a pictureall in all a good buyi went back to the mm formatthe olympus stylus epic zoom qd cg camera is what i wound up buyingthis is a competent camera much like its predecessor but with additional picture taking modes and a zoom lensthe additional picture modes include combinations of flash and timed exposures allowing you to create some neat effects under low light night conditionsthe  to mm zoom lens is effective in framing shots without a lot of ugly negative spacethe camera is weather resistant which seems to be some extra wiper seals on the lens and a thick gasket on the camera back
this should enhance its longevity but dont expect to take it swimming
ill let you know about durability in another  yearsthis isnt a replacement for an slr and isnt intended as one
the quality of pictures is somewhat less than you would experience with an slrbut if you are attracted to pointandshoot cameras and specifically to olympus for their small size and ergonometric elegance be sure to check this one out
endthis is a very nice radio to have around all the time at home and when traveling
it is very small about the size of a deck of bridge cards and i take it backpacking and all all of my trips
im on my second one first one stolen
weather brodcasts are a real nice touch you dont have to wait for a tv or radio announcement of the weather when you can get the report and forecast direct from the nwstv fm and am all work great
good memory setting features of about  for each bandthe alarm is another nice feature when travelingalso nice is the internal speaker which is rare on a radio this small with this many bands and features
the fidelity is all that you would expect from a quot speaker but it is fine for what is is for like listening to news or a talk radio show
the audio is stereo on the headphones on am and is of very high quality on the headphones for all bands tv wx am and fmstereomy only negative comment is minor relating to battery life
i have used alkaline and rechargables and i seem to only get about    hours which is sufficient but adds up over time
i recommend the use of rechargable nimh batteries with this unit to keep the operating costs down if you use it frequently as i dopurchased radio for someone in the hospital who likes late night am radio and hates television
normal am radios did not have any reception in the icu but this one did manage to tune two of her favorite stations
battery life could be better as it ate a new set of batteries each day
tuning in the stations was initially difficult because when i tuned it  at my home with the autotune feature it picked up over  stations some nearly  miles away
i just wanted it to receive her three favorite stations so i had to continuously delete stations until i got her three loaded
it is tiny and will easily fit in a shirt pocket with room to spare
it is truly high tech and about  the size of a standard small radio
it is not cheap or cheaply made
if you like small electronic gadgets and can afford it i would recommend you purchase oneive had this radio for  years now and still going strong
the weather band has always been poor in my area which is why only  stars but other than that no complaints
oh and obviously the tv function is no longer usefull but i didnt get it for that
this is a small radio that does a good job pulling in stationsive had the dtv or its predecessor for years and have been happy with its excellent fm reception and useful interface lock switch auto power off easily accessible volume control
it has survived many dropsthe dtvw has the same ergonomic features is smaller but not much lighter and adds a clock and weather radio reception
the shutoff timer is  minutes instead of an hour which i like and the presets are much more convenient than the v
my only quibble no belt clip
i like that it uses aaa instead of aa batteries since i always have spares for my palm pilot and noise cancelling headphonesi havent tested the earbuds that came with itill probably throw them awayi love radios and have owned over thirty
i am constantly looking for the holy grail  a radio with great reception and plenty of features
i havent found that yet but i can do comparisons
here are the pros and cons of this onepros this is truly a pocket radio and very light
it feels lighter than a deck of cards digital tuning  a rarity in pocket radios
you can quickly scan from station to station and from am to fm to tv has a speaker built in
you dont need headphones
the sound quality is adequate for talk radio and am music
the volume is adequate for quiet environments it has tv audio and the reception was ok on the four major stations in my areacons there is no built in fm telescoping antenna
you need to insert headphones or the included wire and switch it to speaker in order to get most fm stations
a small telescoping antenna would have been an improvement
i find the hanging wire annoying and i think it is just a matter of time before i lose the wire the reception is not as great as the amazon review suggests
i found that there was a good deal of static on several am stations and am is very dirctional
fm was great on headphones though the cary case is a joke
it looks like an afterthought
it is a membrane thin piece of vinyl that will not protect the radio the ear buds are also a joke weather reception was the worst i have ever heard on a modern radio the tuning light is bright and no doubt draining the batteries like crazyif you are looking for a pocket radio that is digital and has a built in speaker this will do
i see lots of room for improvement though
i also think it is overpriced
i think it should be  it would be about right at that pricethis receiver is so small its easy to carry with you always
i have it with me while commuting and bicycling
the reception is great in city or country
it was my best little friend on  and for weeks after when we had no idea what was going to happen next
ive owned one for a few years and through my rough and careless handling i broke it dead
am buying a replacement today howeverthe only drawback is that i have to keep the instructions around to remind me how to set the memory functions but everyday use is easyive been using this on an almost daily basis for a few months nowprosplenty of length for your average size garagecan mount on the ceilingconsretracting mechanism can be finicky  but has much stronger recoil then others ive usedi would definitely recommend this to anyone just be prepared to fight with the recoil until you get the hang of iti received this as a gift because i added it to my wishlist
about the same time i purchased an almost equivalent version from home depot but with larger wire
this is  and the one i have is  or 
this one works well and my other one doesnt
the hd versions wire gauge is large enough that it wont retract fully unless you wind it perfectly
i have to coax it in for the last  feet on a good day and pull it back out an rewind it atleast once when is starts sticking with  feet out
this version retracts fully with no fuss
im really happy with the performancei like the product however after doing some research i found what i believe to be the exact same reel at sears for 
i actually purchased one from sears when they were offering it for  and some change
the construction is identical but the one from sears does not have a circuit breaker to me thats not a big deal
other then that so far it works like i expected it toi purchased this to replace a toshiba am fm stereo micro radio that was credit card sized and fit my shirt pocket while i walked or jogged for many years
the mini stereo jack finally broke and put it out of commission
since none of the other japanese firms produce such products anymore i started hunting around in amazon and other web retailersi chose this unit based on price and on other reviews by other buyers
although it is no where near as small as the toshiba was which was exactly the same size as a  credit cards in a stack this unit performs the same while adding digital and memory tuning
it is very sensitive in both the fm and am bands and provides very good sound using any decent stereo headphone
i use  pairs of sony headphones fit in my ears so that they do not fall or move about while i jog at white plains ny hs track
the ear bud headphones supplied by sangean sound great but would fall out while i ranthe crucial advantage of this unit is the ability to receive fm stereo signals in mono mode which boosts the signaltonoise ratio
in simple terms this makes weak stations sound stronger
sony walkmans no longer offer a mono switch
otherwise this digital radio tuner has functioned very well for me during my many long walks over the past couple of years
a minor downside of this unit is the fact that it is a little bulky requiring  aaa batteries
also the earbuds were worthless and painful but easily replaced by  panasonic headphones
the station preset selection controls are complicated and nonintuitive and the instruction manual is hard to understand
but this is a good tuner and i do recommend itthe sangean ats amfm digital shortwave world band receiver is a great little radio
i have had mine for a bit over one month and really do like it
however it is somewhat larger and heavier than i thought it would be
i bought it to take along on overseas trips but i am afraid it is going to be too bulky for comfortably stuffing into my carryon bag
oh well the unit is going to be a lot of fun at other timesso far i have not been troubled by the short battery life  hrs
described in previous reviews
i suppose that could be a problem under certain circumstances but aa batteries are easy to replace anywhere in the world that has paved streetsi am a bit shy about describing my experience with the sangean ats because several of the earlier reviews were apparently made by radio experts or aficionados much more knowledgeable than me
i am just an ordinary guy that likes to listen to the radio once in awhile but i do have some observations from my experience with it that might be helpfulfirst the radio is touted to be an entry level shortwave unit
i thought that shortwave stuff might be fun to play with but i quickly found out that listening to most programs from europe and elsewhere is silly because i am usually asleep when they are broadcast
nighttime is apparently best for shortwave reception
i find it best for sleeping
further the interesting shortwave broadcasts are hard to find among all of the bands and frequencies availableyes i admit iti am in over my head with shortwave
i even bought a book about shortwave radios that included programming schedules
i am still confused
i suppose a true shortwave fan might find this radio more usable in this area than i have so farthe radio has a great preset feature that i like and use all of the time
radio stations are easy to program in and to scan
i enjoy the sleep feature the dual time display and option to lock the radio for travel so it doesnt turn itself on in the airport like my last radio didthe am and fm stations come very well and the digital tuning seems to be right on target every time
the sangean comes with an ac adapter which is nice but it doesnt charge batteries in the radio
there is a backlight for the display window but it is sort of feeble and is almost useless except in complete darknesslike maybe a cave or a closet with the door closeda set of low end ear buds is included along with a rubberlike envelope that serves as a case
i havent used either one yeti think maybe this review sounds more negative than positive but i didnt mean it to come out that way
the sangean is a dandy radio i use it every day and i do recommend itfor several years this has been my favorite multiband pocket radio
it recently has been bumped from that position by the kaito kasee my review on the kaito
both receivers offer excellent am fm and shortwave performance including stereo to earphonesthe choice between the two radios hinges on features price and desire for ease of usesangean offers long wave reception kaito does notkaito has single sideband mode for hams sangean does nothumane alarm of sangean is less jarringsangean in much easier to usemanual is easy to understandkaito is cheaper but feels more solidly builtsangean has rotary volume control kaito has updown buttons
batteries included on kaito nimh rechargeableboth are pretty amazing for their sizeafter much research for a small radio that can receive shortwave for an extended overseas trip i settled on the sangean   i already have a sony swgr standard in the industry imo but wanted something smaller and less valuable the sangean is about  the size as the sonyinitial thoughts were that  it was chunkier than i was expecting and  the plastic casing seemed cheapive now lived with it for  months and im thrilled
reception for fm and am is on par with the larger and more expensive sony and it is marginally easier to use
i also prefer the sound of the sangean over the sony npr talk radio mostly
with automatic station setting fine tuning alarm light etc it is an ideal travel radio
other nice features at this price point is the protective case sw reel antenna and ac adapter not included with the sony
ive used it daily for  months on the same set of batteriesif i were doing a lot of shortwave listening the sony would still be preferred and the quality feel of the sony is nd to nonebiggest complaints
the flimsy updown tuning buttons and that amazon suggests buying an additional antenna that already comes with the radiofull disclosure this is my th sangean but that just speaks to how good they are in receiving tricky am  fm radio stationsupdate i paid  for this sangean and when i bought my sony swgr it was 
if you can get the sony for  more than this sangean id probably go for it
just make sure it is the same made in japan radio it used to beupdate for december  my earlier review was sometime in  when i purchased the unitafter two years of use i am revising with the following comments and upgrading to  stars if i can figure out how to do that easily since i dont think you can rate something  stars yetdurability ive carted it across  continents over the last few years
its been shaken about quite a bit
absolutely no problemsthe ac adapter sizeweight issue is not important
this unit is a  battery miser
i never carry the ac adapter
when you travel light you dont want to carry any adapter and batteries last a long time and are cheap to replace
shouldnt be an issue even if youre ecologically fanatical due to long use you get out of themi still dont like the dim light but overall the units been a workhorse i must saydetailed analysis will follow if i have the time but overall impression of quality ergonomics and design is very good
for those who primarily want a good travel radio with the shortwave as a bonus i have a few minor complaints light for frequency is not that bright and display is a little small for us older folks who want to see the clock at night without groping for our glasses bigger problem is that the light goes off to save battery power
whats wrong with that
nothing if you are running on batteries but when using the ac adaptor i would like the option of leaving the light on like a clock radio so you can wake up and see the time without groping in the dark for the display light switch the power supply is dual voltage good and almost as heavy as the radio bad
it does sag in a us outlet but that is aesthetically annoying more than it is an actual problemfm reception is excellent i must say
havent played much with the sw yetwritten instructions are good and seriously my overall impressions are very good
clearly much thought has gone into the radio aspects of this device
it is a little weak as a clock radio which is a bit of a shame but it does have very nice alarm dual and a gentle wakeup alarm that does seem very humane
it might have been more accurate to award this radio  starsmore laterive tried a number of compact or pocket shortwave radios
the sangean  is by far the best
it has all the standard sangean features  a digital clock automatic radio turnoff after    or  minutes radio and beeper alarms fine tuning band scanning automatic tuning a tuning light a faintly lit display window and a shortwave frequency range of  mhz to   this last feature is what i most like about the   compact or pocket shortwave radios often compromise on the frequency range but not the the reception of the am fm and shortwave bands  considering the small size of this radio   x    is very good
its physical body seems to be solid although the tuning buttons are a bit delicate
the speaker tone is somewhat tinny of course but not unusually so for a radio of this size
there are no tone adjustment controls nor does it have ssb capability
a power adapter and reel antenna are includedoverall the  is very easy to master since its design is intuitive its also attractive and extremely portable in its small flexible pouch
the price is rather high but a good radio costs moneyi recommend the sangean ats  as a simple highquality compact multiband radio for travelling and hikingreception is super for its size
i bought this radio primarily for listening to fm and talk radio
i dont listen to shortwave
my favorite fm stations  come clear and stereolikeits hard to believe that you can purchase so much performance for less than 
this little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its  bands
moreover it is quite easy to use
sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable
the automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals
selectivity is quite good but one could use a larger tuning knob or i suppose in my case smaller fingers to make those fine adjustments easier
the size of the radio makes it easy to packalthough you get a lot of radio for a few dollars it would have been nice if sangean had included an ac adaptor
i have used this radio a lot since i purchased it and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume
accordingly i purchased an ac adaptor for it
i tried several adaptors before i settled on the radio shack  volt quotinternationalquot model cat
no
this device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered regulated dc
unlike other adaptors i tried this one is relatively quotquietquot  it does not induce hum or electrical noise
best of all it folds up in a very small travel packageif you dont want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel the sg should work well for youthis is a coatpocket sized portable with a very basic design
it can tune  shortwave broadcast bands but none of the ham or utility frequencies betweenits performance on all bands is decent especially compared to other small portables
it covers more shortwave bands than many
sound is not great but again its good compared to others in this classi would recommend it as a radio to pack along on trips
it works fairly well and can be had cheaply enough that if it were lost or stolen it wouldnt ruin your life
it would also be good for those including the visually impaired who have difficulty running a general coverage set with a digital display
or for those who just dont want toim very pleased with the quality and performance of this radio
for the money its hard to beat
not a lot of features but thats why other radios cost more
good reception
i recommend this radioi bought the radio shack version of this radio the dx just as something to hear what was available on the shortwave bands
i am new to shortwave listening and am so far impressed with what i have found so far with this radio but it doesnt seem to have great selectivity
every station i have heard so far has at last  or  other stations bleeding into it which makes it difficult to listen to certain stations sometimes
but for its tiny size and low price it is a good dealthis is a great radio
mine is about  years old
it is very easy to use
the only thing i do not like is that the sw band is not continuous
it is missing the ham frequenciesthis is an old fashioned dial and pointer radio lacking all of the features of a modern digital set no preset stations poor indication of the actual frequency that is tuned no clock no alarm
somehow it is still great fun to useband scanning has been a weak point of digital radios the sound is usually muted while slewing through the frequency range leaving just a tuning indicator light to show that a station has been found most will not stop scanning on weak signals or if not muted a loud chuffing noise is produced as the frequencies are scanned
with this set you just turn the knob and listen for stationsif you want to easily find say the bbc on  mhz a digital radio will get you there much faster but for scanning the band to see what is on the old dial and pointer still works quite wellfor a similar but smaller and slightly less expensive radio see my review of the kaito wrx
for a more expensive radio with double conversion which eliminates false signals on shortwave see my review of the kaito kaive long been a shortwave fan but the price of shortwave units has seemed prohibitive to me until i found this sangean unit
the reception is surprisingly good for something so small and portable
its attractive enough enough that i can leave it in the guest bedroom on the nightstand for the use of my guests and small enough that i can take it with me when i travelnaturally youre not going to get a lot of power out of it but ive had much larger more expensive shortwave units which performed at about the same level so i have no complaints with the sangean
it was a good buyreceives wonderfully but cheaply made
hope volumn knob stays  on for a while
blif you are really interested in what shortwave radio has to offer this is the radio to get
there are better models but for this price its second to none
good sensitivity adequate selectivity ability to separate  signals from one another and lots of bells and whistles
covers all the  shortwave specturm
numerous ways to tune stations the best of which is  the keypad input
digital readout eliminates guesswork as to what  frequency youre on
fm tends to overload in urban areas with lots of fm  signals
the only real downside to this radio is it can be pretty  complicated to operate
plan on spending some time going through the  manual and figuring out all the featuresif you live outside of europe  or the east coast of north american youll likely need to use an external  antenna
 feet of wire with alligator clips on each end should do the  trick years ago i had a cheap portable shortwave radio that never picked up a single station
so when i bought this radio i was optimistic and yet skeptical about any results
so i am a world band newbie and this seemed about the right amount of money to spend on a first radio
heres the exciting news  within  minutes of unpacking this fine little radio i was listening to radio havana then radio netherlands and thenwell you get the idea
success was a matter of attaching the external wire antenna hitting two buttons and turning up the volume thanks to the preprogrammed stations in the memory  over  of them
in minutes i had been around the world and was now scanning the bands on my own
id call that instant gratificationheres three things i really liked and i think will be attractive to a prospective purchaser
 although the radio is complex with lots of features and buttons the buttons make sense  the interface to use the radio is almost intuitive
you cant say that about most modern products with lots of buttons
 the tuning features are fantastic
you can directly enter a frequency using the key pad you can quickly choose a band to search manually you can have the unit scan automatically and stop on strong stations or you can manually rotate the tuning dial which has two granularities  fine and course
the tuning dial is detented and feels great
 the regular amfm performance is excellent
using the autoscan and store feature the unit quickly found and stored all the best signal amfm stations
fm was clear clean stereo and sounded superb on headphones
and i easily tuned my favorite am station from  miles awayheres what i did not like
 the volume knob is too sensitive at the bottom of the range
cracking it open more than a hair was too loud on my headphones
 there are some tiny switches on the side little used i presume which can only be operated with a pencil point not a finger
 the display is an ugly green color which seems very old and archaic although it was reasonable visible
 setting the world time utc seems impossible
i finally had to settle for setting local time to world time
i am not sure why that was so confusing
 the plastic case appears to be a bit delicate
this is not a radio you want to drop on the floor by accidenti cant speak for the technical performance about reception gain selectivity and such because i am not experienced and this is my first radio
however it easily tunes stations from around the world and i thought the sound quality was superb
it is easy to operate i was even able to operate it in the dark and brought satisfying results for about 
i am enjoying it and feel it was a sound purchaseno real problems whatsoever getting this to work  my only gripe is that it quotseemsquot to slow the boot up of windows by a good  or  seconds
otherwise a great product at a great priceyes it greatly improves reception when attached to a telescopic antenna using the included clip
it gave me air traffic and sw wish it came with bnc adaptor though
good for the price for a lazy guy like me
i guess you can get the same results with a long wire and a curtain clipfor the price it will really help bring in some stations
rolls up nice and small for travel
helped some distant stations really clear up and i found some neat number station yes they can still be found with it heheif you dont want to spend much money for improved reception on a portable sw radio this is a good choice
i purchased one and it really does help bring in signals that are too weak when using only the builtin telescoping antennathis is a handy little portble antennathis antenna is advertised as something people purchase along with the sony icfswgr amfm shortwave world band receiver
and the product description for that radio says there are two antennas included with the radio  a ferrite rod internally and the little silver telescoping antenna on the top of the radio
nowhere does it say the external antenna comes in the box with the radio it does
so when i purchased that radio i also purchased this antenna
though i never opened up the packaging and tried out the separately purchased sangean antenna with the sony radio i have absolutely no doubt about its quality
the antenna that came with the sony receiver appears to be exactly the same antenna  just without the sangean name on it
assuming it is and id be very surprised if it isnt made in the same factory even on the same assembly line the antenna works great
its compact long enough to significantly extend the capabilities of the radio and stores easily out of the way when not in usejust dont buy this with the sony icfswgr amfm shortwave world band receiver  thats already got one
i see that this antenna has the same frequently bought together buying suggestion that the receiver does
amazon took my sangean antenna back without any hassle and credited my credit card quickly with an apology  and a promise to take out the frequently bought together suggestion on the product item pages
its highly misleading to say the least
so in that regard im not impressed with amazon for leaving that still up on both products well over a month since purchase nowgot an old icfswgr receiver that didnt come with this antenna back when you purchased yours
by all means get it
its well worth the moneythis short wave antenna has increased my reception on my shortwave radio by more than  over just using the radios own antenna
it has increased my reception on all bands including am fm tv and shortwave bands
installing the add on antenna is a breeze
highly recommendedi used this with my tecsun pl
indoors it did nothing
outdoors i hung it from my nd story balcony
it brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna
for stations i could get in without it the signal was cleaner and stronger
it worked better when plugged in than when clipped on even though when clipped it still showed an improvement
it is very easy to reel in when donethis isnt a magic shortwaveattracting antenna its a simple wire that can be plugged into the shortwave if it has a jack or clipped to the aerial if theres no antenna jack
try a couple of different orientations and you can usually improve the reception of a handheld shortwave significantly
there is a similar kaito antenna that is harder to wind back up but is otherwise the same
i also have an older sonybranded antenna that appears to be identicalthis antenna is nice and portable fits in my portable radio carrying case and gives a decent boost to reception
its not magic though and you could in fine diy fashion hook up  feet of wire to your shortwave for much the same effecti have two eton grundig radios
both the sdl and the mini are good radios for me
the addition of this useful little accessory this random wire has made both radios even better receiversin short sometimes the additional antenna helps with reception sometimes the effect is negligible in a few instances it is best to disconnect the antenna
in talking to a friend who is very knowledgeable about all things radio this is what can be expected of this type of simple easy to use equipment
i do use this antenna in conjunction with a grounding wire when using the sdl and i find the combination to be very effective
the sensible adapter clip works fine with either radios antennawere i to recommend any improvements to this product i am doing so here id suggest the addition of a sort of lockinplace device such as one often finds on tape measures or fishing spools
the strap is handy but a hook of some sort off of the spool case would also be a useful feature
of course one can fashion a hook and employ it with the strap to partially work around this
these are suggestions from an indoor user stringing about windows and curtains where these sort of features would be quite useful and the kind of user likely to gain in numbers over timeoverall this is a very useful device for better sw listening
id recommend this simple antenna to anyone who is looking for a way to easily improve sw reception
its not a panacea for sw reception issues but it certainly does help ones reception in a lot of circumstances
the reasonable price and super saver delivery are also positive factorsi works just fine with my little sony shortwave radio
i like the fact that it retracts making it easily portable
it is definitely not an outside antenna with regard to reception but it is significantly better than the little factory antenna
i would recommend it to others as a starter antenna for receiving shortwave broadcaststhis hard drive was received in good shape and has worked in my nas box in a raid configuration
i have not profiled it for performance but it is working flawlessly alongside another tb seagate in the raid configurationbought two of these for my macpro   very easy to install open mac case find empty hard drive slot push them in reformat them and theyre up and runningdo video work so these have been a great additioni have not had it in the machine for very long only a month so i cant attest to its long term reliability
so far in use its a tad faster than the  gig seagates and wds that it replacedbefore i formatted or used the drive i did check the firmware version and it seems amazon is shipping the latest drives so thats a good thingso its a decent speed  tb drive at a decent price so no complaintsgiving it a  as some of the previous tb drives gave me problems and im still a bit jadedi had bought  of these for my home server and one of the  failed
amazon was awesome and overnighted me a replacement drive
i sent amazon the request to replace the drive around  pm one day and the new one was in my hands around  am the next morning
if thats not great service i dpnt know what is
 after getting the replacement drive the remaining  drives work fantastic
thanks amazonupdate  a newer generation of this drive the bulkoem version has been available for a while now and has better performance in terms of speed and power consumption
so thats likely a better optionoriginal reviewas of now this is the state of the art seagate tb drive
it uses just three drive platters the thing that looks like a compact disc in the photo  theres actually a stack of those inside your hard drive
older tb drives used  or even  plattersless platters means greater data density which means faster data transfer speeds
less platters also means cooler operating temperatures usuallythe  line of drives uses gb platters
the new  drives with gb platters is starting to be released  a one platter gb drive is available now
a two platter tb drive should be out sometime in the next month or twoby the way a few notes about oem  bulk drives oem or bulk means it comes in plain packaging with no software screws or cables
if youre replacing a drive that may not be a problem
but if its a new installation youll need a sata data cable and often a power adapter as of  seagate has reduced the warranty on their oem hard drives from  years to  years
not a big deal to me as after  years im not going to pay to return the drive and put the yearold model refurbished drive i get back in my machine anyway
the real issue is whats the reliability of the drive so you dont need the warranty
its very hard to get a good answer on thatmany people would say buy a seagate western digital or hitachi drive and after that its a roll of the dice
certainly making sure your fans are working and you clean out the dust bunnies helpsthis is a great adapterconverter for international travel
with a trip to several european countries  the uk this was just what we needed
the only issue i had was w the weight
its rather heavy so we chose to put it on our carry on which we then had to deal w
i would buy this same one again thoughi purchased two of the recoton adf  sets for a recent trip to italy
they worked flawlessly with both high and lowvoltage devices
we tried them with hair dryers digital camera battery rechargers etc
and no problems
they are quite large and heavy though and we ditched the carrying case etc and just threw the converter into our suitcasesone important thing to remember is that you only need a voltage converter if the devices you wish to power are incapable of operating at the voltage being provided in the country youre visting
i found that my cell phone charger and my nikon digital camera battery recharger were both designed for both  and  volt operation read the fine print stamped on the charger so all i needed was the plug adaptor and not a voltage converter for these two chargers the plug adaptors are about  eachmy wife needed this for her trip to chinait worked great till she blew it up by not checking the settings before she plugged a new item into itthe price 
rd of what radio shack was going to charge for the same setupso all in all we were very pleased with this purchaseyou get what you pay for
ive used it with us electronics in ireland without any problems
ive used dvd players recharged batteries but not used it for anything heavy duty
seems the same product is sold under many different namesi used this product successfully in the uk to recharge my camera and heat the flat iron for my hair
i would not recommend keeping things plugged in overnight or left unattended to recharge
the main step down units gets very hoti have purchased many switches and have found the netgear ones such as this  port to be very dependable
as with all lan switches however even these are vulnerable to electrical surges so they should be installed behind high quality surge protectionthe first switch broke after  years of use
replaced it with an identical switch
will see how this one lastsdid not notice any issues with performance
does the jobi purchased this switch  years agohappy with it however the supplied power adaptor seems not to provide enough current it runs hotit seems to have more current power adaptor to run at least a do not use the supplied adaptornow i install it vertically on the wall just warm to touch just use  out of for more stable operation a stronger power supply is recommended at least v aim using this in my home theater to share an single ethernet connection between a dvr dvd player and a streaming video player
it works well for this application
in a dark room the blinking status lights can be annoying
if the status lights could be disabled id give it  stars hint hint netgearit worked as soon as i plugged in the switch off the router
each device i plugged into the switch connected right awayseems to help the speed and visuals appear faster
no problems with it would purchase again
keep in mind this is a switch not a modemthis is a good ethernet switch and works as advertised
i needed an efficient and reliable switch inside my network control panel a panel in a closet where all my telephone cable tv alarm system and ethernet wires interconnect
since the panel was rather crowded already i needed a compact unit with a hardy case
this unit fits the bill and it is working as designed
this is an industrial looking switch well suited for inside a panel
it would not look so great on a desktop
for that i would recommend the linksys se a similar unit seemingly reliable with a sharper look
i did not have the loose plug issue another reviewer experienced
mine fits well  luck of the draw i guessin my house i have a wired ethernet backbone to heavy users plus wifi
you use an ethernet switch sort of like an outlet strip for power
you plug one ethernet run from your cable or dsl ethernet modem source into the ethernet switch and then can plug up to  other ethernet runs or devices into the remaining ports on the ethernet switch
it doesnt require and setup  you just plug and go
it lets more devices share your internet connectionthis is a small box and feels solidly made due to its metal case
it uses a small external power supply provided to power the ethernet switch
i has been my experience in the past with netgear products that these tend to be very reliable and long lastingthe only small negative is that it would be nicer still if they put the power supply into the device itself
i am not a fan of the wall wart power supplyi use these as temporary network expanders in conference rooms or hotels
they work well and the price is goodit works perfectly fine
i got this product cause my wireless router ports were all used up and needed more for my pc and bluray player and xbox  and works fine
only problem i have is the power cord doesnt fit in the switch port it keeps slipping out
but i just tied it with some string and its good enough for me as long as it works
xd  im sure if i returned it and got another one it would work alot better
i prob just got a faulty one this is a nice compact port plugandplay switch that definitely improved the speed of my local pc network
i read a review where this switch runs hot
i have all five ports in use and its running around f degrees
my dsl modem with just two ports in use actually runs hotter f
okay four degrees but you can tell a difference when you touch them
the fs switch does not interfere with am radio reception as my old linksys  port hub especially at the upper am radio band
perhaps it is the metal box of the fs that provides better shielding
its nice that netgear gives me the screws and wall anchors for mounting the switch to something either wood or plaster
but is it too much to ask netgear to include a mounting template piece of paper so i can put those screws exactly where i need them with less fuss than measuring and guessingperhaps i should not be disappointed that the fs i got is not the same one as pictured on the amazon page
that picture shows an uplink button and the unit is wider
i connected a cable from my dsl modemrouters uplink port to the first port of this switch and it works just fineif you only need four to five ports this is a very nice nonmanaged switch
and did you know that according to netgear the mean time between failure mtbf is twice that of either the fs port version or the fs port version
it may make more sense to buy two of these switches from a reliability sensehaving used ethernet for a number of years i have accumulated a collection of switches and routers
since they are such simple devices i was surprised to learn that they do breakburn out
after testing my old devices i purchased two of these netgear switches to handle the array of ethernet connections now required for the current home entertainment systems
so far so goodi have two
chose them over flimsierlooking plastic switches and it seems to have been a solid choice
they do what theyre supposed to which in my case is to double the ethernet feed to hardwire my two pairs of dish boxes and bluray playersbought this to replace a dynex switch i got at best buy for 
the dynex was plastic and felt cheap
i love that this netgear switch has a metal body
it feels like better construction overall and at  less its a great deal
all the ports work exactly as expectedmy only complaint is that the power plug and the rj jacks are on opposite sides of the switch
this may not matter to you but for me it was slightly annoying because the switch sits in an entertainment center just like a dvd player or a set top box
it would be nice if all the cables came out of the same side so everything could be together but it certainly isnt a deal breakeri would definitely buy this againi needed a simple switch to collect data from three devices and pass across a wireless bridge to my acccess point
the location is out door in a harsh seaside environment
the switch is mounted inside a waterproof box along with its power supply and another poe power supply for another device
my concern was mostly that the switch might overheat in direct sunlight
after two weeks it is performing very well and has experienced several days in mids
it also works flawlessly over the wifi bridge connection
im very happy with this switch
if it does ultimately have issues with heat i would not blame in on this device as i am pushing it hard with this particular applicationive been using some version of this little switch at work and at home for the past several years
theyre not fancy or the fastest switch in the world
but theyre solid handy small inexpensive and they just work
as an it guy i view it like i view a power strip
always good to have a sparei originally had a hub and when i realized that i wasnt getting anywhere  near the throughput i would get with a switch the obvious choice was  netgear
the switch is fast slick looking and has leds to tell you  everything about your connections
the downside
design
the ethernet  cables plug into the front of the unit while the power cord plugs into the  back
the problem here is that if your ethernet cables are as flexible as  warm butter they get in the way of the leds or each other
when i plugged  three cables in the box sat to the side because the weight of the cable  held up up
if you are going to wall mount the unit it comes with screws  to do so then that might help but if you are going to set it on your  desk the ethernet cables have to run from the front of it instead of  behind the unit also gets warm so make sure you have clearance on all  sides so it gets air
otherwise despite the design issues the product is  slick
has led for mb full duplex collisions and the th port  doubles as an uplink for fast networking netgear makes a quality  productthis network switch from netgear has a small footprint and is easy to hook and use
im using this in my home theater to connect several internet capable devices to the single ethernet drop i have in that location and the switch has been working flawlessly for that purposei agree with the other reviewers in that this is a very solid built and reliable product
ive been using mine for six months now and have not had to touch it
it performs very well as ive ran multiple file transfers simultaneously among four computers and it was amazingly faster than when using an older  hubthe one complaint that i have about netgear switches and routers is that many of them have the ports on the front of the unit instead of the back
if youre installing this in some outoftheway place like your attic or basement or if youre installing in a computer rack where you want everything facing front this is a nonissue
if you want to put this on your desktop it is a major inconvenience because the cables coming into the switch will either be strung across the front of your desk or will snake over and behind the unit
in either case you have cables on your desktop and its quite unsightlyall things considered im still happy with the netgear switch but if i had it to do over again i would have probably bought one that worked better in my home officeit does tend to bottleneck your internet connection so that is a point of concern if you work for a large company
i bought it since our office only has one computer internet outlet in the charting area and i needed to hook up a second computerplugged it in it worked fine and it continues to work
if you just need a few more  mbs rj ethernet outlets this little box will do the job
nice solid metal boxthis is a good switch and works quite well
i like the fact that the netgear switches are made of metal and not cheap plastic like almost everything else these daysnow regarding the rebatesits comical
you need to presubmit your rebate through a company called prosaferebates and they are clueless on the current rebates going on with the netgear prosafe switches which means you cant presubmit your rebate and even if you could you couldnt check the status
if you enter the promo code for the current rebates  you get  matches on the prosafe website
i even emailed them and sent them the current rebate form pdf from amazon and they claim the last rebate expired in january even though this new rebate offer runs from   if anyone knows an address where i can just send in the rebate without this presubmit nonsense please let me knownetgears line of metal switches and hubs has always been an affordable dependable product
i am glad to see that they havent abandoned this format in favor of the plastic so many other companies are usingi bought a couple of these for work when a group decided they needed to cram three conference rooms full of people on short notice
netgear was the only product i trusted to work and they didnt let me downat this point you might want to consider the gs
even if you dont need the gigabit speed currently you might in the futurethis switch works great
it is really easy to use
just plug in your devices and thats it
you dont have to even think about it it does everything all on its own
this switch is built like a bombproof shelter very tough
it dosent have a fan but runs pretty cool even when stacked on top of other networking gear in a uncooled enviroment
the only problem i have with is is that there were  unused ports and the little wire things the touch the cable like kinda sunk down so they couldnt reach the cable so i had to use some tape to get to touch the connectors thats why i gave it only  stars
other than that it continues to run my network with no problems at all
i am more than  pleased with netgears fs
i will be receiving a gs switch because i need a bigger gigabit one and i will also be receving a n router
will be puting reviews about those products up soonheavy requires external power source runs a bit hot  but gets the job donethis product does exactly what i wanted it to do
i plugged in the ethernet cables and it worked great from there
netgear is a great productworks just fine for me  no problems at all
good quality metal casing is better than some of the cheaper plastic hubsworks well and is an easy way of multiplying access into your network to avoid having to rerun wiring of home runs to the switchplug and play 
literally
supereasy to install and plays well with other network equipment
liked it so much i bought its bigger brother tooit works
i keep a couple in stock when my customers routers use up their router portsit looks solid and so far performs the same waythis switch allowed me to hard wire in my entertainment center with only one data jack available
i can know plug in my surround sound blu ray cable box apple tv and tv
the all now have a hard line faster downloadsits a box of magic and it works real simple to hook up 
no brainier for about anyone
great pricemuch better build quality than linksys
for switch to hide behind your equipment i would recommend
the ability to mount this on a wall is a plus for cluttered equipment situationsok im back
its now  years later andstill going strong ill have to change this to  stars cisco switches are good for one year
i would suggest picking up the gigabit version with  ports leave room to grow this piece of equipment will out last most items you will be plugging into it ill summarize the performance in one word delightfulif you need gigabit speeds search for a different product
personally im using these netgear switches with asoka pluglink s and i couldnt be much happier
a couple of these switches and a homeplug system is sweet
now ill just have to wait for homeplug av equipment with gigabit speeds so i can buy newer faster switches  great router got it in just a couple of days no going to best buy to get ripped off anymoreif you have much of a network in your home or office like me  devices you probably need an extra switch here or there
i have one in my closet one behind the television
and one behind the wall in the back room
i also carry one around in my computer bag just in case
netgear makes good hardware
i would buy again in a heartbeat if i needed anotherthis is the best keyboard on the market
i love the quotblue buttonsquot i realy only use the volume playpause prev track next track this is awsome with winamp
another great thing are the usb ports on  the back the keyboard is a usb hub that is where i have my mouse  connected
the only thing that i would change on the keyboard is that the  keys should press a bit less like the ibm keyboard or keyboards on some  laptops
another shortcomming is that it is very thick and it will not fit  in the keyboard drawer built into my desk when the legs are put uporiginally i had rated this keyboard very well but after using it for  months im gonna have to downgrade it to a hold
its nice but a minor mishap with soda totally ruined the feel
i took it apart washed it throughly and now the keys have a very stiff feel and the space bar likes to miss half my strokes
ive done the same thing to my older ms keyboards and they all took the sodawashout treatment pretty welland the thing is pretty heavyive used an ergo keyboard for a couple years and have no idea how i ever survived with out one
it goes without saying that ergos are much better than flat keyboards
your shoulders feel so much betterbut when my natural elite finally died piece of crap that it was id grown attached i was excited to try the prolet me tell you after only one day of use im already wondering how i ever worked without these hotkeys
the media keys are especially greati had grown so sick of having to hunt around with my mouse to mute my music when the phone rang and this keyboards quotmutequot button has proved to be my new best friend
several of the buttons are customizable so i was able to remove several frequently used shortcuts on my desktop now able to access my calculator and my documents from my keyboardim having a little trouble adapting to the placement of the quotinsertquot keyits where quothomequot was on my elite and youd think microsoft would have a little consistency with those function keysa perk for less advanced users frequently used control shortcuts like ctrlc ctrlv ctrlz etc are actually marked on the fonts of the letter keys
ive been amazed by how many people still mess with their mouse to do a cutnpaste so hopefully this will introduce more users to the ctrla ctrlx ctrlv quick keyboard method of cutting n pastingi agree with other reviewers that the usb ports are not really all that exciting but i do have both my mouse and digital camera plugged into the ports
works greatthis keyboard definitely doesnt give you that click that many of us are used to
but im actually enjoying the muted clack insteadso watch out for those hotkeysyoull get hooked toothis is a great keyboard and my hands have felt better since the day i got it
however i excpected it to be a usb keyboard which it is not and i thought the usb ports could support all devices which it cant
the primary reason i own a keyboard is for typing so i think that should be the focus
this is a great keyboard to type on and i recomend it for that purpose
i also find the hotkeys extremely well placed and choosen
they are very usefull
the usb functionality is only semiuseful hence the four stars
i couldnt make all my devices work well on it nor is it a usb keyboard it still needs the ps port
neither of these things were huge downfalls for me but the were annoying as it was not what i was excpecting
i do highly recommend this for typing but if you absolutely need usb functionality buy a usb hubthis keyboard is an acquired taste
once you put the time into using it typing on it for hours at a time is definitely easier on the hands
it does have a clackity clack sound when typing and i had to make a special wrist support pad  by  cut with a bandsaw to fit the contours and a gel pad on top
the keyboard is roomier and larger and i learned to touch type on it
put small felt dots on the f and j keys to make it easier to get your fingers on the home keyswith the new intellikeyboard software i remapped all of the  gray buttons to things like word explorer cut copy paste next application open close exit print and more
its like having the new ms office keyboard with the ergo that i cravei simply cannot type on a slab anymore
too cramped too quiet and too painfuli found that i can type far faster on this keyboard than i can on a straight keyboard which was a pleasant surprise
i expected it to be more comfortable to use and it is but the speed increase was a nice bonus
the keys have just the right amount of resistance for high speed typingof course the standard warning about this kind of keyboard is  only buy a natural keyboard if you are a touch typist
if you hunt and peck you will hate this keyboardthe multifunction keys are a really nice touch
best of all they work without you having to do a lot of setup
this keyboard can be connected to your computer via the usb port or the ps port or both
thats really important because all the information i could find on this keyboard never made this quite clear
for me it was crucial that only the usb connection be required for my laptop because my laptop has no keyboard connector whatsoever
for my desktop i have both usb and ps so i went ahead and plugged in bothif you only have usb you will not be able to use your keyboard until the machine has booted at least up to the windows password prompt
if you have a bios password and you are not using the ps connector you will have to enter the password another way like by using the irritating mushy keyboard built into your laptopone complaint that i have is that it is very hard to use the ctrl keys
you have to get your hands pretty far out of home position to hit them and its awkward
i write software for a living and i use ctrl characters all the time so i find this a bit annoyinghowever overall i find the experience to be supperior to using a straight keyboardlet me first say i really like this keyboard
i have severe tendonitis and its a lifesaver
both the layout of the keys and the key action softer than normal contribute to the increased comforti am a quotkeyboard personquot as opposed to being a mouse user and i use the cursor arrow keys a lot
i tried to use the microsoft natural elite keyboard but found its diamond arrangement and smallerthannormal cursor keys impossible to get used to
this keyboard has the keys in the traditional invertedt layout
if you ever use the cursor keys spend the extra money for this pro model instead of the elitei also really appreciate the intellitype software that comes with the keyboard
it used to drive me crazy to accidentally hit the caps lock key
with the intellitype software you can disable the caps lock entirely among many other customizations  problem solvedso why didnt i give this product  stars
two reasons first the function keys are smaller than normal
i wouldve preferred them to be full size
second the hot keys are dark blue with icons molded into them
the problem is that the icons are not easily visible at a glance
it wouldve been far better to paint the icons white for high contrast and easy legibility
as it is its annoying that i have to scan the buttons to find the one i want
good idea poor executionstill even with these minor flaws i love this keyboard and heartily recommend itthis keyboard is great
the hotbuttons are addictive
but i would recommend spending the extra money to get the pro natural version
its worth the money for the extra hot buttons and usb hub
especially lately because everything you now buy is usbi cant give this thing  stars for a few reasonsnone of them being bad reasons just personal issues
as far as the keyboard itselfit is absolutely wonderful
you wont get the tactile feel of most keyboards as this is a very light typeri love that though as a personal choice
new  keyboards tend to take some getting used to but this one required  practically no time at all
the only thing it really is missing to me is  audio control built in
now this may not be the idea of this type of kb at  all but it would have been a real nice additioneven at the cost of   extra
it still would have been more than worth this pricenow  dont buy this here
keep in the game amazon or take this off  your site because your not doing anyone any favors at this pricealthough it is made of plastic it works
i bought a second one
what was missing was those donut disc that fit over the bulb to block rain from going into the socketnot the greatest but after a month it is still working great
i wish it had more than  and  minutes light time though but for  you cant really go wrong
im running the watt ge cfls and it all works flawlesslyi purchased this product  based on other customer reviews and the price
arrived on time and it installed easily without any problem
i have had it for about  months now and it is still working greatgood product for the pricei mounted two of these on my deck and they work just fine although for just a little more money i could have ordered the sl that has a wider sensing range  degrees is provided with more mounting options and has lamp holders that are easier to adjust
the color of this fixture is more ivory and the slwhc was more whitegreat for the price
but very plastic
it works and is up doing what it is suppose to do
i wouldnt buy another
i would pay more for an led one nowi bought this from amazon and have installed it under the eaves of the house in the back yard
it works very well but has a narrower sense angle than the newer model that i purchased at over twice the price at home depot
the one from amazon seems to be an older model on clearancei also added a simple ac powered audible beep alarm to this heath motion sensing light so now it emits a single moderately loud beep whenever the zenith  heath sensor detects an intrusion and the flood lights come on
this modification required connecting an external home brew beeper box between the two red and neutral wires coming out of the rear of the unitthese replaced the sensors in my motion detector lights easily and worked perfectly
i was glad not to have to replace the entire lamp
not exciting or inexpensive enough for five starsmy last heathzenith sensor on newly installed light lasted about  years
i thought i would have to buy the whole unit but glad they sell just the sensorbox said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch but i didnt
i dont understand why that was neededthe original sensor came with a green ground wirethis sensor does not
not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anywaythis sensor turns the light on full bright right now
my original sensor ramped up the light over a second or twono directions so just pay attentionwhite to white black to black and red to red
pretty strait forwardi needed to extend a phone in my apartment without having to drill holes in the wall
so i decided to purchased this ft cable which arrived promptly
unlike others on the market that are flimsy this one is of good quality and works just as advertised
id definitely recommend it to my friends or anyone whos looking for a phone extensionthis is officially compatible with dymos labelmanager   pcii labelpoint  labelwriter duobut it works just fine with the dymo labelmanager d which is not on the liston this cassette the tape needed a little bit of priming  had to manually pull about one inch out before anything could come out but all was flawless after that
the output is the expected ultracrisp black on white and according to the maker the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces
in real life the labels stickiness do meet my standards but ill have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objectsoverall nice labelsmade in belgiumdymo is a leader in label printers i use them at work and at hometape is what they advertised
waayyy too expensive but all label tape seems to bei bought this in conjunction with the label maker for those special label making occasions
works well and would purchase againim using this to protect labelit is clearyou can put it above your already printed labelsthan youthese labels are ok they stick to most surfaces as expected
i will probably buy again since i have the label machine but i wish they would stick to all surfacesgot it in a very timely manner
love being able to label various items wish that it was dish washer resistant or at least lasted longer from washingi really cant live without my letratag i use it for absolutely everything
in addition it is very affordable
its the greatestworking on a living trust estate binder and the label maker will in handy making tab labels
will provide update as i progress in this projectthe letters are always clear
this tape seems to stick better than the paper version so i usually grab this one even though it costs more than the paperi loved this product right from the beginning just from seeing how it combined the program listings from my cable and directv providers into on guide and would automatically switch between inputs depending on what channel i selected
seems logical but no one had ever done it  beforethe  is the way to go at the moment because youll find this  so addictive that any less storage space will not be enough
i find that  the standard recording quality which yields  hours of recording works  fine for me at the moment with both my dss and cable programming  considering its better than i was getting with vhs
i suppose that if you  get hooked on the better quality it would probably be hard to go backi  was disappointed that the  does not come with firewire ports as  advertised here on amazoncom as a box with future programming  improvements and expansion possibilities was really exciting
once the  copy protection issues are worked out id love to be able to add another   hours to the unit with an external drive but maybe replay will  facilitate that somehowanyhow the bottom line is this unit is in many  ways the home entertainment appliance ive been looking for for many years
its smart its convenient and it can only get better as features are  improved and small bugs are removed
when was the last time you were able  to upgrade the firmware of your vcrfirst the good news no question this is the future
im not a tv guy watch maybe  hoursmonth yet already ive found myself skipping through commercials creating a telletubbies theme for my daughter and discovering good shows that id have missd otherwise
 the company is clearly committed to its customers
ive had to call customer support the folks were friendly and helpful
the setup and user interface are clearly improving and the program guide is easy to use
 as always is a great place to buy this great price and superfast deliverynow for the rest of the story
 setup is simple enough if youre comfortable with say setting up a fax machine
 usability is very good but not quite excellent
i frequently find myself trying to remember the difference between guide and menu or input and or just buy a wireless jack here
in all this is a great version  product where version  will be truly excellent
i highly highly recommend it but know that the next generation will smooth out those last few rough edges
live a little and buy it now really
its fun to be a bit ahead of the curvei bought a replaytv before christmas but found that my old tv and video didnt have the right connectors to go with it
the replaytv manual told me how i could work around this problem but it looked like the workaround  would give me poorer picture and sound quality so i sadly decided to  return the replaytv and wait until i get a new tv
if you own an ancient tv  and video think twice about trying out the replay
and if youre about to  buy a new tv make sure you get one with svideo to ensure best performance  with new gadgets like the replayhaving said that amazons service was  so good and its returns department so helpful that it was no hassle to try  the machine out and then return it
if youre unsure about buying one the  day return policy certainly makes it painless to check the system out
even though i didnt get to use the replay i was impressed by the manual  im a documentation writer myself and the easy setup guidei ordered and received my  hour tivo from amazoncom last week
i have a home theatre system with all components cd dvd phono digital cable box amp vcr connected through a yamaha topoftheline av receiver
as none of the example setups in the tivo manual remotely matched mine  and despite the fact that normally im pretty good at this type of thing  after about three hours of complete failure i was positively stumped
i  finally had to call tivos customer care support
and this is where i am  so very impressed
i was absolutely blown away when the tivo  representative stayed on the phone for over an hour with me as i crawled  behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone  with various cables in my teeth
  she walked me through every step and  with persistence and effort on both our parts finally we got everything  hooked up and quottalking toquot each other
ive never experienced  customer service like this before on anything ive ever bought
amazing
and as for the tivo and how it is working now  great and i love it
only  thing i didnt like was the fact tivophilips have truly overlooked the  customers with home entertainment systems calling a set up like mine  quotadvancedquot  from what i can tell more and more consumers are  going to the quotadvancedquot systems so it would be good to see tivo  include hookup examples for quotadvancedquot systems in their future  product manualsafter running a phone line behind my stereo cabinet which i could luckily do myself i connected my tivo to my vcr stereo and cable box in about   minutes
when i powered on the unit it took me a few seconds to realize  that my vcr input needed to be set to quotlinequot before i could see  the tivo screens
the onscreen guided setup procedure went without a  hitch the most difficult and timeconsuming part was determining the  remote control codes to allow the tivo remote to turn on both my tv and  stereo system at the same time
i also had a few false starts configuring  the system to control my cable box
the first time tivo dialed into the  main computer the actual connection lasted only about  minutes but tivo  busily sorted and indexed the downloaded information for about   hours
the system is so quiet that if it werent for the green light on the  front id have no idea it was even powered on
the software and the  screens are well designed and very user friendly
i have friend who can  barely change the channels on his tv using a remote control and he was  easily able to navigate the system and program it to record his favorite  shows ive been giving demos to all of my friends
the system can  automatically update its own software every day so i imagine there are  many more features coming soon
everyone i show tivo to has some great  suggestions for improvements and i hope to see some of them in future  versions
to summarize in  words buy it
i admit i was skeptical at  first but im a  tivo fan nowthis is a very useful product for people who watch a lot of television
the tivo is a simple product to use once you figure it out
it can record a whole season of a series or just one show which is very useful
now the down side to it
when they say  or  hrs they are not telling the total truth
the number of hours of recording which are stated are for terrible quality recording
for the  hr phillips tivo recorder which i have the good quality recording is only  hrs which is dramatically different
and another defect that annoys you sometimes is the mistakes of changing channels that it does sometimes
for example if i want channel  recorded for a little time it will change to channel  or  because the frequency isnt set perfectly on the cable box
this is an annoying part of the tivo
if there was an autofrequency adjuster then that would be perfect
but again it is the time which really matters tivo fools the customers into thinking they will have  hrs of perfect recording which is not true but the settings of quality can be changed to multiple levels which increases the time available depending on the level
i hope you find this review helpfulthis is a great revolutionary product
its pretty much as great as everybody says
ive had mine for a couple of months now and have no major complaints
however in case tivos reading all my minor complaints  followtivo comes with all kinds of hardware
everything except a coax  splitter which you need to buy if you want to continue using the tuner on  your tv
which i think would be just about everybody because you have to  do this if you want to watch live tv while tivos recordingthe season  pass records all showings of a particular show no matter when or what  channel its on
however if you pick a show thats in syndication or a  cable show thats repeated often youll get many more than you actually  want
itd be better if a season pass was only good for one channel and  time period
also be nice if it were smart enough to not record additional  showings of the same episode
another bad thing about this is that it will  not allow you to create other seasons passes if it thinks it interferes  with the first one
like say you only want a seinfeld season pass for a  pm showing but seinfeld also runs at pm on some other channel i cant  set up a season pass for some other pm show without disrupting the first
of course the way around this is to record by time but i think some  improvements can be madewhen watching live tv it keeps the last   minutes unless you switch channels or a new show starts
this means that  if i stop watching without pausing near the end of a show and a new show  starts in the meantime ill have lost the ability to go back and watch the  end of the show i was watching
i dont see why they blow away the last   minutes when a new show starts particularly if its on the same  channelas other people mentioned itd have been nice to have a  skipforward feature so you could skip forward in increments of  seconds  or somethingitd be nice to have a menu option to have a less  conspicuous play bar or to put it at the top of the screen instead of the  bottom
it covers up things like who wants to be a millionaire questions  until it times out and disappearssometimes the sound loses its top  frequencies such that it sounds like a bad speaker
s sounds sound like  static
this might be a function of the broadcast but live tv doesnt  sound that wayitd be great to have a vhs record list feature so you  could record multiple programs to videotape all in one go
sometimes i  make tapes for my  overseas friends and having to record one  hour  program at a time is a pain in the rearwhen scrolling through program  listings it makes you wait a second before bringing up the next screen
it should be preloading each screen in advance so it doesnt have to waste  this kind of timedue to program scheduling many times it will miss the  last  seconds or so of a broadcast so you might miss that last joke  while the credits are scrolling
it should give you an option where it  will always record a couple of minutes beforeafter a program if there  isnt another program scheduled to be recorded immediately afterwardsi  guess thats about it
dont let all this scare you away
its an awesome  product and now that i have it i wouldnt watch tv any other wayi bought tivo in early  i love it but the unit has hadits share of problems
the warranty is only  days
my unit had problems with the ir receiver in the unit not receiving the commands
yes it was the ir receiver as i have two remotes and neither worked unless you were  inches from the unit
it was over  days but i had called several times on this issue and finally got them to exchange it without charging me but they do not ship the new unit until they receive the old unit
i sent that to texas and received a new one within a week
the second unit was what they called doa dead on arrival
it didnt work either
it says refurbished on the bottom
so now i am sending it back at another shipping cost
another issue is that this receiver learns programs actors directors etc
that you like
so with each exchange i lose all of the info it has learned
all of this will lead me to send a letter to the president of philips but even getting his name took two calls
when i explained why i wanted his name to the person who answered in new york city she hung up on metivo is amazing
i am not much of a tv junkie but tivo has me hooked
like most people i put in a long day at the job
it is so nice to come home and actually have something i like to watch
i am a big twilight zone  fan
most quotzonesquot air either in the middle of the night or  during working hours
i set my tivo up to give me a season pass to the  program
when i come home after work there are always at least  episodes  recorded for me to watch
the only problem that i have is that sometimes  the audio does not match the video
its sort of like watching an old  godzilla movie
i have to go to the menu and restart the receiver to fixive had my tivo for about  weeks and im very glad i bought it
it took alot to convince my girlfriend that it was a smart purchase but when she realized how easy it was to record her favorite shows she agreed with me
no more fumbling for video tapes or botched vcr programmingi sort of  wish it had more capacity
 hours means that things are deleted sometimes  before we have a chance to watch them
also the video quality does get a  little funky when you save everything in basic mode max
compression but  its certainly not unwatchable
i know a  hour unit is available but i  couldnt justify spending the extra  for it
i hope phillips offers  some kind of upgrade path for the system
by far the coolest feature of  the system is the auto mode where tivo learns what you like and dont like  based on the programs youve chosen to record or given your approval on
its always interesting to see what it comes up withi have a few minor  complaints mostly simple design flaws
while the idea is cool that you can  get a quotseason passquot which means that tivo will record every  episode of a particular program regardless of which channel its on it  would be good if you had the opportunity to limit the scope of the season  pass
say for example you want to get a season pass to the simpsons but  you are more interested in the newer episodes on fox on sunday night and  not the older ones in syndication
the way the device works now a season  pass gets you all of them within a few days your tivo will be full of  all of the episodes you can stomach leaving no room for other programs
on  the other hand if you choose a season pass to antiques roadshow youll  get the pbs and the bbc versions so there is definitely a benefit to  having it work the way it doesto the designers credit tivo wont  save the same episode of a tv program twice at any given time however  this only works based on the tv guide descriptions  if a program is  entered with quotno description availablequot tivo will tape duplicate  episodes over and over againanother minor complaint is that trying to  switch channels through the tivo in quotwatch live tvquot mode is a  little clumsy
theres a noticable lag while the tivo tells the directtv  box to switch the channel
i also prefer directtvs program guide to the  tivosthese complaints aside i am very happy with the machine and im  very glad i bought it
now i never channel surf  theres always  something good to watch something i want to watch
i dont know how i  got along without itim an engineer at a post production company
we often have visiting production companies in and out constantly moving and adding pcs and network printers
there is only one jack in each office so these little hubs come in handy
so far i have had none fail
the only reason i give it four stars is as the manual states when you use the uplink port the adjacent port cant be used as they are interconnected
this usually catches people who just come and plug in and then wonder why they cant get on
other than that no complaints
a great hub for the moneyi bought this router to split the connection in my room so i could connect to my xbox and my computer at once and its working perfectly so fari had no idea what this iswas but i bought it
it worksgood price excellent servicedeliveryi mean this thing is small
im a network administrator but i only have one ethernet port in my office so i needed a switch or hub to allow me to add more than one computer to the network in here
this thing sits on my desk and have a really small footprint
its awesome
it has all the indicator lights i needwant and it fast really fast
i have always been a fan of linksys products and this one is no different
if need a hub and can spare a few bucks for a switch they are faster and this one is great
and yes it has an uplink porti bought this thinking it could work with my isp service and a cable modem to have multiple computers share internet access but i was dead wrong
the unit doesnt seem to allow the sharing of a single ip address and thats all my roadrunner isp allows for each account
so if youre in socal and are with roadrunner i suggest you get a router
linksys has a decently affordable onethe linksys befsr port etherfast cabledsl router
check it out
but not to beat this puppy with a shovel its not a bad switch
file transfer rates between computers through the switch arent too bad and its a cinch to install
just remember to check all your network settings
peace outworks fine when i bought it covers the whole house all  sq ft finally died after several years
bought a cisco valefolus to replace iti loved the easy no hassle set up and agree with the favorable reviews on this switch
one warning note though if you connect the switch to the internet through a router you only have  usable ports not  one of the  will be empty but not usable
not a problem for me and i put some tape over the unusable port to avoid confusion
its the one next to your ethernet connectioninstallation and network setup was a snap
the fifth port is really the upstream connection
so you get four clients not fiveworks greatgood coverage
had a small problem setting it due to changeing my isp from cable to dsl
called tech support and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptopits been two months since installation without any problems whatsoeveri purchased this switch like most folks to allow an existing linksys cable modemrouter to provide an internet signal to an additional ethernet port in my house
in the meantime i recently bought a sony bluray player with internet video streaming but i found that the existing linksys modemrouter could not handle the upgraded highspeed service
so i bought a new motorola docsis  cable modem
i naively thought i could simply use this linksys switch to send the signal along its merry way throughout my house
wrong
after several hours of reseting the ip address on each computer and several calls to charter my isp i called motorola
the motorola surfboard modem is a throughput device that assigns only one ip and the linksys switch is not a smartmanaged type that can assign individual ip addresses
so i have a new router on its way from amazon which should solve the problem once i place the router immediately after the modem but before the switch
the router will then assign an unique ip address to my four computers and bluray player
perhaps this is common knowledge but the technical support staff at charter were not aware of this
so just an fyithis linksys switch does what its supposed to do
i was able to connect all  computers to it and had no issues with operating all  at the same time
i trust linksyss productsthe linksys ezxsw etherfast  port workgroup switch does the job great i did not have any problem with any linksys product
i use this switch with a wrtg router because i needed extra wired ports
i gave  stars because i want a  volts transformer this version use a  volts oneworks good so farjust remember to connect your computers in the order that the ports are labeled
i was having some connection problems until i realized i had moved some cables around and skipped a portthere is no doubt that this is a great switch and with  ports you cant go wrong
just plug it in and go
i have been using linksys for years with no problems and we use all cisco equipment at the hospital where i work
i only gave  stars because the switch in the picture is not what i received
this switch is smaller and all black
really no big deal but i like to receive what i am looking at
otherwise i would have said  starsi got this ethernet card when i upgraded to dsl
it works well and i never experienced connectivity issues from iti recently picked up two of these cards to hang two systems off of a cable modem
the installation couldnt have been easier
just plug the card in and install the drivers
windows me had no problem recognizing the card on either machine
once the cable modem was installed everything worked like a charmtwo words of warning the directions are very complete but dont include specific directions for windows me
i doubt this would trip anybody up and the windows  directions are certainly good enough the drivers available on the linksys website require you to know information that is only available on the card
if for some reason your box doesnt have a driver disk one of mine didnt make sure to download the correct driver set before installing the cardi had a cnet network card before and got terrible network performance
then i decided to switch to these linksys cards and they worked like a charm
coupled with the linksys  port workgroup switch home networking is a breezeso why did i give it  stars
i wanted to use the wakeonlan feature of the card since my old cnet had it
but when i got the new linksys card the wol was only through a feature called pme power management event whereas the cnet and other cards provide a wol cable that connects to the motherboard
the linksys card did not provide for this cablealso the card is version  but keeps appearing as version  in windows xpbottomline if you need an affordable reliable easytoinstall and configure bit nic look no further than the linksys lnetx etherfast  lan card
for the past few months the unthinkable has been happening my intel pro gbps desktopclass network interface card nic had been failing
i didnt want to believe it but the last few days it has been none too obviousthe problem every time i restarted the file server the nic was installed in the adapter flapped that is the link was dropping for long seconds then come back for a minute then dropping the link againthe only way to resolve the issue was to turn the server off unplug the rj cable from the nic turn the server back on log into windows then plug the rj cable back into the nic
after this procedure the nic would stabilize
by not following the procedure the server would hang at applying security settings
i played this game for the last three months until i finally grew tired of the drill
i caved in and slid my spare linksys lnetx etherfast  lan card into the pci slot
problem solvedthe the lnetx etherfast  lan card is a high performance nic designed for desktop computers with bit pci expansion slots
right out of the box the lnetx etherfast  lan card is ready to run on both baset and basetx networks
the mbps nic can automatically detect your networks maximum speed and adjusts itself to the appropriate speedthe lnetx etherfast  lan card also features wakeonlan wol a feature that allows you to remotely turn on the computerthe nic is equipped with two leds amber to denote a network connection speed of mbps and green linkactivity to signal that the card has been connected to a network
the light will flicker when data is being transmitted and received over the network
the rj can accept a category  or  network cablefirst impressionsi am very pleased with my new linksys lnetx etherfast  lan card
i installed the nic in a dell tower computer with windows  server standard edition
after the nic was detected windows  installed the appropriate drivers afterwards the lnetx etherfast  lan card was ready to use at full mbps duplex that is mbpsconclusionsince installing the lnetx etherfast  lan card all has been well with the servers network connectivity
though i have always installed intel nics in my server platforms the linksys lnetx etherfast  lan card has proven itself a worthy stopgap replacement and one i might just keep in place over the long haulwe were able to complete our project with this zip drive
it worked well for uswhat is good about this zip drive is that it is very easy to install and requires basically no configuration just plug in and install the software
the one thing i dont like about it is it sometimes freezes up  your computer while you are backing up files
i mean you dont have to  restart the computer or anything you just cant do anything else for a  couple minutes
sometimes that can be a pain
all in all though its still  a good producti liked this device for a long time but gave up using it years ago
since then i havent used a stylus but miss that aspect
i havent seen anybody using a palm device in a long time and dont recommend buying one nowhowever anybody that wants one of these palmone devices can try out a used one at a reasonable pricei had a mishap with my palm v during a softball game where the palm was pretty well destroyed
i was more than a little concerned as i had a date in a couple days and the only place i had the girls phone number and address was on my palm i was lax in doing my daily hotsyncso with some fear i put my badly dented palm into the hotsync cradle and pressed the big button on the front
some whirring and clicking and it still synced
that says a lot for the construction quality of this pdathe palm vx is really a standardsetter
small footprint great connectivity to the pc and to mail programs like outlook
many many applications written for it some shareware some you can purchase
easy synchronization via the cradle interface which is also the recharging unithere are the prossmall lightweight fits in a shirt pocket
standard os that is widely used
loooooooong battery life
plenty of memory for most textbased application
mb plenty of peripherals like a sexy little keyboard a combo ballpoint penstylus travel adapter kits  car battery charger ir exchange which works quite wellcons its fragile
even in the brushed steel folding case i bought the screen broke when it slipped from my hand
its palm os which means it doesnt have the advantages of the pocket pc former windows ce os to run powerpoint there is a new program for the pocket pc that lets you view and hear powerpoint
it doesnt have color display
the screen font could be clearer there are better ones on other pdas the telephone and wireless stuff isnt in it thats either the palm vii with builtin wireless or other brands
no mp player no voice recorder
and the battery pack is not removable although it lasts plenty longshould you buy it
if you want an organizer and email reader this is excellent
its what i use every day
the long battery life is a real boon to the traveler
it packs a lot for the money
the optional accessories are priced too high but this is a complaint against the industry in general
you buy the basic unit but to add some useful doodads you can rack a significant percentage of the purchase price in no timei love my palm vx
i put alarms for all my meetings appointments my daughters school functions birthdays etci make notes on things that need to be done and my phone directory is always with me
the only improvements i hope will be made is that phone functions will be added and the calendar can show a week or month of appointments at onceive owned my palm vx for about a year and a half now
despite the hype over much higher priced units i still think its one of the best pdas out therewhat i like  memory and lots of it
if  mb does not sound like a lot think of what youre using a pda for
theres plenty of room for the phone book and appointment book
thats  of what i use my palm for
ive never run out memory
 lots of freeware and cheap shareware addons
the most useful is the new palm pdf reader from adobe
i can take important documents with me as a pdf and have them as a look up document
other nifty utilities ive picked up include a travel alarm clock with world time zones ip calculator and some neat games to pass the time
coming on strong are text document readers and databases
 good monochrome display with adjustable contrast
sure color on pdas is a hot topic but from what ive seen color is not worth it on a pda
the color is poor and it really decreases battery life
 built in rechargabe power and long battery life
no hassle with batteries drop it in the cradle and it recharges
ive gone as long as three weeks without rechargingwhat i dont like  i had to add pocketmirror to synch with outlook
when i upgraded my desktop the outlook synch was lost until i purchased a new pocketmirror
i have no gripe with the performance i just wish this was a standard feature  no expansion capability
i know i said it has enough memory but i wish i could add an mp player or use smartmedia for archive storage
 it looks so nice i have to watch out someone dosent quotadoptquot minepdas are what most people really need when they say they need a laptop
if you really do need portable spreadsheets or data bases and total email management capabilities you do need a laptop and no pda is going to fulfill your needs
a pda is a handy electronic version of the old standby appoinment book with some adapatability to other tasks
as for the current crop of hype topics wireless
its a solution in search of a problem
color
keep it on the big screen where it belongsprosa lightwight  small enough to be easily carried in a pocket
just handle it gently  its a delicate device b
lots of free or very cheap applicationsi got a lot of my favourite games pacman space invaders tetris chess etc for free and an excellent spread sheet software for c
infrared communication is greati can exchange applications and data with other palms and even exchange info between my nokia  and the palms phone book alas one at a time  a limitation imposed by the nokia  not the palmd
the mb of memory are plentyi have an exchange compatible spread sheet application games a years worth of appointments in the calender dozens of book phone entries a few spread sheets etc and use only mbconsa the major downside of the palm vx is that it is delicatethough i kept the palm vx in the special leather wallent the screen broke twice in eight months
as the warranty doesnt cover the screen breaking i had to pay for the two fixes nearly as much as i paid to buy the palm in the first placeb
syncing the palm to two different computers is problematicthis is especially troublesome to people who would like to keep the palm home computer and office computer in syncc
the cradle set is somewhat cumbersomethe cradle is used for both charging the palm and to sync it with the computer
this means that when travelling abroad i have to either carry the whole cradle set cradle cables and transformator which works with both v in israel and v in the us or buy a travel kitd
many of the accessories for the palm are expensivea set of three styli costs  which is high for three pieces of plastic that are mass produced without human touch
a charging kit just a transformator and a cable is much more expensive than a charging kit for a cellular phonei have had the vx now for about a month
its the ultimate geek toy
well designed for use
two negatives  ive already had it freeze up once and force me to hard reset it
so get in the habit of hotsyncing everyday
 shame on palm for selling an appliance meant to be carried around in your pocket or purse and not providing a good protective case for it
plan on spending another  to  to buy a caseyes i am writing the review years after i bought the productbut hey it is an excellent one that i used for several yearsif you are not a netflix type of person and still have cddvd at home this wallet is the way to gonothing special
just holds a lot
doesnt seem very substantial so i wouldnt carry it around much but its fine for storage which was all i neededthis is a very easy and neat way to store your cds
if there is any problem at all it is that it holds so many that it is quite heavy when fulli bought two of these and they work well for the price paidi would have added a label holder and a capability to add a few more pagesthe disk slots are not the newer deluxe versions but are adequatethis organizer is probably one of the better constructed ones on the market
true it is not the best looking and at times even feels poorly built but it holds up pretty welli prefer this organizer because of its binding
organizers with riveted ringbinder style binding etc
tend to give way very quickly
fellowes bindings have multiple points of contact and are very durableanother important thing for me is access to my media
i hate badly designed organizers whose zippers sratch my media while trying to remove or put media back
this organizer has been designed to permit the least amount of interferencefor those who need more assurance fellowes makes all gorgeous
cd organizers for body gloveone star for the blandness in looks and the notsotough quotlookingquot zipperi prefer the body glove zippersthis is a pretty good deal for a  cd wallet
i was considering the case logic wallet but it is about pricemore than the fellowes
the construction of the fellowes is good and similar to my other case logic wallets the carrying handle is especially usueful as it can get pretty heavy when full
my only gripe is the design of the plastic covering for each cd slot
it is basically an oval shaped hole in the plastic placed near the hole of the cd while you can grasp the cd hole and top of the edge of the cd to start to remove the cd you will reach the end of oval so youll have to pinch the top of the cd to remove it from the wallet
for this case you cant grab the hole of the cd and the edge and remove the cd in one motion
nevertheless this can easily be fixed by cutting the plastic to open up the hole
doing it that  times was major pain but worth it as it is alot easier to remove cds nowwe had the cd books inserted behind the cd which makes it very bulky but contain more
better to use  the capacity and place them one next to the other if you can afford the spacethe book is large and well made
personaly i would prefer such a thick book to be harder cover with o ring binder which it isntthe pages are binded to the cover so you cannot move pages around but rather have to move the disks
it is harder to alphabetize and add cds this waybottom line a good well built basic productat first i couldnt wait to get this
i ordered  at the same time
as i started to fill the pages i started seeing the first of several problems
pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper
speaking of zipper it is very hard to work when the wallet is full
the other day i wanted to see about getting more cd wallets not necessarily fellows when i read the reviews here for this wallet
i read the part about not putting cds in the inner pockets because they would bend
i went home and checked mine
sure enough when the wallet is full the cds are slightly bent
i would imagine if they were left that way for a period of time they would probably stay curvedi have purchased a lot of cd cases and i must say this one is great
built solidbought this after i realized twelve years of computing equals a heck of a lot of optical disks  the sleeves are at least as soft on the disks as the newer case logic carriers i have and definitely softer than the pre case logic carriers
it seems durable enough and with a carrier of this size the sewnin pages are probably better than a binder
this carrier is probably not the best for portable storage  the carrier really doesnt open well unless its sitting on a flat surface
but for my purposes  sitting under my desk as an archive  it fits the bill just finethis cddvd case was well worth the price for one this sizei was looking for a way to hold all my cd and dvd in a more efficent way
i have used fellows brand before
i out grew my case logic cddvd holder a few months ago
for the price the fellows is a good product but the handle is kinda generic and the overall looks is blah
it can hold  cds no problem and came with a cloth to wipe of the dust
i like the feel of my case logic holder but if i upgraded to  version i would had to have paid  more
i am happy with my purchasei have had my  for about a year and like it very much
its easy to use and i agree with most of the comments below and takes good quality pix
most of mine are flowersbirds
i use the nimh rechargeable batteries  have two sets  and have no problems they last much longer than the nicd ones
i use a microtek reader connected to my macs usb port and with an earlier mac used a card
my only big complaint is the lag time between seeing and taking the shot  often a problem with birds
question are any of the cards betterquicker than others
i have a sandisk
i am also thinking about upgrading to the  but wish it used aa batteriesfor the most part im quite happy with my coolpix  bought at amazoncom
it certainly gets the job done and the images are as good as what ive gotten with my mm slr if not better
my main beefs are the ones that are well known about this camera  the flash and zoom are both very limited to the point where i pretty much consider this an outdoor camera  the one time that i did use it indoors extensively  i set the sensitivity to iso and shot by available light and i wish it were possible to manipulate the fstop and shutter speed directly
and ive got a new beef  due to the small size of the camera  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the lcd screen
but these notwithstanding it is a great camera that takes good well exposed crisp pictures and thats the bottom lineheard about the images this camera and the  gave and they are great
this is not a point and shoot camera because you have to override some of the automatic settings when there is backlight or even frontlight
i would not recommend it for anyone who hasnt had a  mm that they had to tweak the picture
the best thing about this complaint is that you can view the picture immediate and reshoot it again
one reason i got the  instead of  is that it takes  aa batteries and the  aa rechargeables are less costlythe camera has no usb connectorit uses a serial wire which means it can connect to most pcs or older macs but needs an adapter or a usbenabled flash card for newer macs
apart from that it takes good pictures and at the price its selling for now its a good entry into digital photography
the optional lenses are great and will transfer to other nikon models later if you upgradei prefer the form factor of the  even though they are bigger because of the way the body twists
this makes it so you can see the lcd when youre holding the camera over your head pointing down or down by your knees pointing up
great for pics of kids crowds etc
the nikon  series are the only still cameras i know of that do thisthis is the first serious digital camera i got and ive been pretty hapy with it
great macro decent zoom and fair response time
the other complaints you hear including how it chews batteries and the like are generally true
still given a pocket full of batteries id take this with me when i go placesmy biggest complaint is the size it doesnt travel super well i like to keep my hands free im forgetful and often misplace things
i like to stick my camera in my pocket and it just doesnt fitstill its plusses make it a decent camera
id check out some of the newer coolpix cameras if you were buying new and had the budget for it theyre a great linethis camera takes wonderful pictures but the zoom doesnt do the job
its no good for taking pictures of your child playing football but its great for pictures on a trip
be careful the lag between pushing the shutter and taking the picture is long as well as the time between pics at high qualityi agree with most of the positive reviews of this camera
this camera gave me good results on a recent trip to europe
 the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera
i took over  photos before i needed to change the batteries and was not too stingy with the review mode
that is not great but certainly not as bad as i was led to beleive
  the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot unless you are super careful
get used to it
 the software isnt that great but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with
 the camera is not very good for action shots but that was not a major issue with me
 the camera is a little bit big compared to say the canon elph but not really too big or heavythis camera is very good value for the money i might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras
overall i was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures from my dc  and my wife was quite impressed with the picture quality as well
i only wish it had a little more optical zoom ability a burst mode and more memorywe bought this camera several years ago and have taken it with us on two trips abroad and many trips around the usa
im not a camera maven but ive just had a terrific experience with this camera
our pictures come out clear and sharp
it is easy to use
the color is great
the camera feels good in my hands
mine came with a  mb card and i bought one extra mb card
i can travel for weeks at a time without ever worrying about quotfilmquot  ive even dropped the camera by accident a few times without breaking it
the flash works nicely in a variety of light
if i had to find one thing to criticize i would pick the zoom lens but i have yet to see a competitive product with a better one
in short ive taken thousands of pictures with the camera without a hitch
in fact i usually have a big smile on my face when i see the results
and my friends and family do tooive used  or so digital cameras before but this is the first one that i bought
before i go on let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the kodak   however i see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the  no rechargeable battrerieslet me talk about the camera
it is very simple to use yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers
the annoying feature that makes me give this a  star rating is the location of the lcd screen  i found that if i use my right eye which is my dominant eye in the viewfinder that my nose touches the lcd screen and smudges it
come on kodak that was a goof
this does not effect the quality of piuctures its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the lcd cleanother than that it is terrific
i immediately purchased a sandisk  meg compactflash card and have since ordered a  mb card   battery life is long i do use the power save mode which is not on by defaulta few tips
once you experience digital photography youll discover that just like videos things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it
also this does have a limited telephoto power with just a x optical lens  not a problem for me but you need to know what you want if you want much more than x i think you should look at an slr modelbuy this one its a great valuehave you ever taken kodachrome slides  the color saturation is upped a little as is the contrast everything is a little realer than real
and why not
kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color  and they have applied it to their newfangled digital cameras
you will  not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor  can a  digital camera really be this good
it looks like a kodachrome slide   heck it looks betterprinting is another thing
the reason pro  photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the  range of contrast is much greater than prints  prints can only reflect  light not generate it as can a slide projector or computer monitor
so a  great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light and as even your  basic printer can print at  dpi the lower resolution of the digital  camera makes its effects felt
however i find x prints at the highest  resolution of the dc quite acceptable using a hpc
but the camera  cannot make uncompressed files  all files are jpeg compressed to some  extent and the artifacts may showthis is a point and shoot camera  no control of focus shutter speed or aperture is possible
the camera is  a little heavy and you wish for hooks for a neck strap
you wish for more  buttons on the body of the camera rather than having to go through levels  of menus
the lens front is very vulnerable and the lens cap is not  automatic  it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding  metal or plastic guard as some of kodaks competitors doi find the  battery life using kodaks supplied metal hydride batteries quite  acceptable particularly if you buy a second set but the supplied  alkalines lasted only through the evening i bought the camerai am a  wide angle person rather than a telephoto person but in an ideal world a  x rather than a x would be welcome  mm equiv
is hardly telephoto
this is basically a wide angle to normal lensive been a darkroom  photographer since  and a sometime professional since   i am  delighted to see the end of chemical photography with its dangerous  chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results  in color
now all you need is a digital camera and an inkjet printer
prices are falling  give it a trythe dc is a nice little camera but the results i get from it arent any better than those from oy old dc that it replaced
in fact i find the autofocus to be less accurate or at least harder to use than with the  and alas it still eats batteries by the tonafter careful consideration our family bought a kodak dcthis camera looks great usb zoom lcd panel many features but get to know it
while usb is nice not all computers  have it and windows  is necessary
also the mm zoom is no where  near as good as i would have liked definetly a x zoom is required
while the resolution is nice remember that thats not all to a digital  camerai really like this camera
i am getting much better results more natural and vivid colors with my digital camera as compared to scanning x  photographsthere is no need to worry about color adjustmentsi  researched many cameras before deciding to buy
this one seemed to be the  best quality for the price
the two main enhancements in this camera vs
the dc are the support for uncompressed pictures and the ability to  record audio annotations to accompany the pictures
these two features  swayed me to the dc
in all honesty i find that i am not even using  these features
the uncompressed format takes up way too much memory you  would need to buy mb storage card to get around  uncompressed pictures  at the highest resolution
i have found that the best quality jpeg  compression produces fine quality i can print greatlooking xs and i  can fit  times more pictures on the memory cardthe dc also has  slightly better max resolution  x  vs
 x 
the  dc also supports a  x  resolution that is accomplished using  interpolation but this probably wont produce any different results then  enlarging a  x  image using photoshop or some other softwarei  have found that battery life isnt a problem as some suggest if you use  nimh rechargeable batteries
they seem to have a much better life than  alkaline batteries rechargeable or not
i also limit my use of the  display which is not difficult since i tend to prefer using the  viewfinder
this significantly reduces battery usage
the only draw back  is that you cant use the digital zoom without the display
this is also  not a problem for me because the optical zoom has been sufficient for my  usage
also digital zooming in general tends to produce poor quality  pictures although i cant personally attest to quality of kodaks digital  zoomingthe one problem i have with this camera is the delay between the  time when the button is pressed and the time when the picture is taken
its a least a second or two which makes taking action photos very  difficultits hit or miss with the timing
i tried to use the burst  feature but i found that to have limited usefulness
i was use to using  the completely manual tried and true pentex k slr
without being  overburdened by a lot of electronics there was very little latency
i  suppose going to any automatic camera digital or not could produce the  same frustrationallinall i love this camera
it takes great quality  high resolution pictures
however i would also look at the dc as a less  expensive alternativethe dc is great for photos in which you get to pose your subject but for action shots it should be avoided
the amount of time that passes from when the shutter release is pushed and the time that the camera actually takes the picture seems like an eternity
im sure its only  seconds but ive missed out on a few moments because of that time lapse
would i suggest my friends buy this camera
yes and i have
but if you are buying it to cover sporting events you should look for something with a shorter quotthinktimequot my terminology for the shutter lagupdate  ive owned this now for over a year
ive really come to love it
when i bought this camera it was a couple hundred dollars more than what it is now but i decided it was going to get treated like any other camera that i have owned
which means ive done everything except try to pound nails into wood with it
i bought a mb cf card to go with it a must in my opinion
i wanted to upgrade to the kodak dc but that was a mistake
the dc is a mess compared to the dc
the only thing good about the dc was the software upgrade
my computer used to take about  minutes to shutdown now it takes seconds
if you buy the dc get the latest software and drivers from kodak if you already own the dc and are thinking about taking kodak up on there tradein towards a dc dont do it
the dc has so many dead pixels that color rendering is atrocious its also so cheaply put together that i would be scared to treat it the way i do my dc 
the dc may be oddly shaped and heavy but its a sturdy workhorsei use this camera for work and i use it quite frequently
this is a very good camera but not quite perfect
it has a lot of nice features that are standard on digital cameras these days a nice lcd screen that eats the batteries away at an alarming rate and is nicely contoured to hold
the picture quality is excellent for my line of work which requires  x  photos the resolution is excellent and the colors are great as far as i can tell anyway
my favorite quality about this camera is the ease of loading the pictures on to the computer
just plug it in it loads the program and you pick your folder and the pictures are transferredthere are some negatives about this model too
one is the size it is a bit large compared to other smaller models
this may or may not be a problem for many people but i prefer a smaller camera
the other is the power button you have to hold it down for an undisclosed amount of time to get it to go onshut off
these are not big complaints but the camera could have been better
kodaks customer service has been top notchyou will hear consistently that this camera is slow and to some degree this is true however it takes awesome pictures
ive begun to print mine out even xs and this camera is just great
with the new price reduction pick one up
you wont be sorryafter much research i finally decided to buy the dc as my first digital camera
the picture quality is great
kodak seems to get the best reviews when it comes to photographic fundamentals thats the selling  point of this camera  the quality of the pictures is great
the color  depth of these pictures is phenomenal and under any lighting conditionyou can get over  pictures on the mb card on the high quality  setting as good as a roll of film  or much more on the standard quality  settingthe usb transfer is fast and easy i dont think a card reader  is necessary so long as youve got the ac adapternot included to  conserve battery life
the camera appears as a drive on your pcthe  only major drawback of this camera plagues all digital cams from what ive  read  battery life
its really poor
i killed the first set in only a  couple hours with minimal lcd screen use and this wasnt continuous use
even if youre conserving battery life by all means possible youll need a  backup set of rechargables or  or  backup setsalso for the price they shouldve thrown in the ac adapter and maybe even a casekodak dc is fine for mediumlong range subjects
however because the viewfinder and the lens are offcenter you invariably get offcenter results  unless you use the lcd as your main viewfinder this eats battery  life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot  decisions
however the image quality is quite excellent for most  outdoorlighted conditionsthe interaction and placement of the  controls are quite good
there are a few key rubber finger and grip  affordances to make the shooter feel in control
the only cheap part is  the zoom lever
its a small horizontal lever that has to be kicked way  over to one side or the other and the time delay to lens movement is  sluggish
the overall construction of the entire body and finish is very  nice
theres plenty of standard features like burst timelapse etc
to  keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy
a real nice package bonus was  the  aa nimh rechargeable batteries and charger  mb storage card
at  least kodak was thinking about the entire user experienceoh the pc  software interface is rather silly
the childlike icons and metaphors for  album creation etc
makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model  for what is essentially foldersfiles on your computer
something more  straight forward with clear icons and interface is all we want
use the  quick access download near the clock once youve installed the softwarethese arent exactly audiophile grade but work well in my application
these were a special buy available through amazon and were at about  the list price
the cable jacket and connectors are sturdy
at the price i would definitely buy these again for all purpose usagethere is quite a bit of controversy out there on monster
i really dont want to dive into it but if you feel its over priced i suggest you google the difference between monster digital cableshdmi optical etc and monster analog cables such as this rca cableim only an audio enthusiast but i worked in radio shack back in the day when it was still radio shack
if your going to tell me some razor thin high gauge rca cable is going to not only save me money but sound just as good as the monster
then i wish you the best with your sound setup but your missing outshielding matters quite a lot when it comes to analog cables and this cable doesnt disappoint
i also like the fact its about  off the regular price if purchased from amazon
i purchased these for my father in law who saw an instant improvement in sound quality for his ht
i did give the product  star off as it does have the infamous super tight connectors
i understand why monster wants to do it but they should develop an easier method of twisting and pulling to get them offall monster cables are overpricedavoid being rippedoff if at all possible
they are high quality though so thats why they charge too muchi wanted a cable to connect from my computer to my bose system
this does the job admirablythere will always be agruments about whether monster cables are worth the money and i think a lot of it depends on your personal situation
id suggest going for the cheapo radio shack cables first and only upgrade if the perfomance is not satisfactory
youll save money more often than noti bought this set to install in my car for a trunk mounted mp adapter so i needed extra length and suspected that noise immunity would be needed as well
they work fine and i have no complaints but i do want to point out that they are very bulky
the molded base of the mm jack is almost as big as my mp player and the cable is like a garden hosei would give this five stars if it werent for the ugly colors
it is a great product and offered for a great price
i think the price is lower because of the ugly colors
it is nice that it is labeled for different entertainment inputs though
they are color coated they just make it look like a weird rainbow
i still like it though and highly recommended the producti love the thick plug wire plus the offset of it
i am using it for my xbox  receiver and hdtvits great to have the colorcoding for each of your components and i believe that monster is a reliable brand
it may have been nice to have a coax connection to protect my sat receiver but i am a bit dubious of the actual utility of coax connection surge suppressors
i suspect that in general surges are very rare or nonexistent from satellite dishes to the receivers unless brought on by a lightening strike in which case any surge suppressor would be unlikely to withstand the strike
because of this i saw this particular power protector as the perfect solution for my needsthis is an excellent unit and does what its supposed to do
makes it easy to shut off several circuits at once
i like iti did not rate this five stars because the flat male plug is on  degrees
thats fine if the electrical receptacle is left of where it is intended to be used but if the receptacle is to the right cord will go off in the wrong direction till you can double it back
also would be nice if it came in optional white or beige
the heavy black cord doesnt look good in our living roomjust bought one at best  for  plus tax
needed it for big tv that was arriving earlier than expected otherwise would have done it via amazon
there price is just about  lessps also wrote review on how my new  tv was an  dollar savings via amazon as wellthe angled power plug keeps it from being knocked out of the socket by the bed  just exactly what we have been needing for many yearsthe plug end does not swivel like the belkin model
i had to pull out the receptacle from the wall and turn it over so that the power cable would point downwardthis power surge protector has plugs sideways which works well for many devices with large plugs
it was a good price for a brand name producti was always concerned about the spacing between points of such devices
same happens here these are too closely spaced and some of the chargers eat up so much space not letting you place more than  or  devices at a time
cannot complain too much of this because it is understood clearly from the device and its description and pictures
other than this its such an awesome devicei like the warrantytoo bad their made out of the country you want americans to buy your stuff but you dont employ them so they have the moneythink about itthe money you save you losethe av looks like a pretty standard power strip with bright colors painted on to help you organize and categorize your connections
stickers and cable guides come with the strip to help you organizethe strip seems to be well built but i really cant say for sure whether it can live up to its claims
i guess only an independent testing lab could do thatas far as the rated protection level you could probably find another power protector that has a higher rating for a similar price
however my experience with the monster branded products has been favorable so i really bought this item based on the company reputation and past experienceone benefit of this power protector is that you can plug it in with the flat power connector and move your furniture if applicable close to the wall unlike normal power strips where the plug sticks way outif you have really high end equipment or live in florida as i do i would recommending spending a little extra for more protectionworks like any power strip should and the quality of the cable on this feels very nice its thick but not to stiff at all
the only complaint i have is on a few of these i bought some of them are hard to plug into like it may be off inside the device possible quality issue
but works with no issuesits a really good product  i only deducted a star because what i wanted to plug into it was really too wide to fit them all
that isnt the fault of the strip though and its made very well with the ft cord making a huge differencei got this as a deal of the day and it was worth every penny
monster products are great quality but somewhat expensive so when you can get them on sale they are definitely worth purchasing as i know it will last for years and yearsim using this off of my ups for extra equipment i maybe testing or using
compaired to other multi strips you cant beat the quality and price
maybe a limited deal so not sure if still availablethis is a no frills simple power strip
i user it for a secondary entertainment center for my tv cable box and dvd playerthe power strip does its job
it does not have any power cleaning activitythe strip is a little bulky but not too badfor the cost it fits the need and the risk tolerance i wanted to pay forwhether you are a fan of monster or not the price is right even though it doesnt sound as fancy as the other surge protectorsi have been using this product for last one month now with connection to  inch lcd  xbox and sound system works perfect
i think with the price tag this is optimum for the intened use
good product and the seller too packingdelivery goodoverall thus rating i do like monster power products but you certainly pay a premium to get them
thats okay  its slim has plenty of plugs and works
after a lightening strike that blew out some other electrical items this item was still running strong so thats good
i dont know if it mattered the fuse box took most of the hit but still im glad my tv etc
didnt blow upi like the color coding of the power strip and its a better strip than most cheap strips found in regular retail stores
cords are good quality
i prefer monster cables to cheaper makes and modelsi mean its a simple power center it works i hope it doesnt fail but you wont find out until its to late
hope the brand name will stand up to their previous repits nice to have the color coding to easily see which cord is which
theres no phone or ethernet protection
fits a lot of cords in a fairly compact spacewhat can i really say
it does what its supposed to or at least i think as i havent run across any power issues
ive always been happy with monster products and thus far this is no exceptionthe product met expectations and was adequate for my home theater system including tv bluray player audio video receiver cd player and cable modem and cable tv boxnice product which is color coded to help assist in controlling the maze of electrical cords to our home theaterstereo systemi was having major issues with lesser surge protectors being able to keep up with the constant ac usage and allowing me to use the lamp and laptop without blowing the circuit or the protector
this bad boy is compact when you factor in all of the plugs you get has a convenient side plug which allows it to fit snugly behind my couch and this sucker does the jobused this for my tv
it had plenty of places to plug in the components
and it had a good joule ratingworked as intended
at the end of the day it is just another extension and all tat color stuff just a waste of timeno signal lose or connection issues to report
the sockets are easy to get to and coaxial connection was a breezeheres the deal
i dont know or understand much about surge protectors
i just know that when you but new electronics you should buy a new surge protector suitable to the product you are buyinggreat unit for the price
able to house up to eight devices
had mine for several months and several thunderlighting storms
still going strongdoes exactly what i purchased it for
powerrs several devices from one plug
the monster name is well known and trusted so the slight extra expense was worth itits okay for what im using it for probably would be great for most others
i purchased it to handle those transformerplug devices that i have connected to my computer
i have two other similar types  of strips and this one is probably the best of the bunch as being advertised as made for transformerplugs
the problem is that there are many different size shape and angle of the plugs
and depending on what you have you seldom can make use of all the outlets there is just not enough space between outletsok first off this unit works well though it does not have phone line surge protection as others have noted
it is a larger unit and doesnt hide well but it does have the cable ftype protector so if you are looking for cable protection this may be for youthat said keep in mind everyone is rating this unit  stars and few have actually had a test situation where you can actually address how it truly performs
its like having a set of car tires that have never had a flat because youve never been offroad or in rough areas and yet you rate them as toughasnails on the trailhow would you knowthis surge bar is rated to  joules
what does this mean
well it means that it can provide up to  joules of power before it pops or protects your electronics
that is equivalent to  wattseconds or on v ac about  amps of current
what does this mean to you the user
well it means that it will break the circuit if more power than wattseconds are sent through the line normally because of a storm or a carwreck into your local utility poles etc
what it will not do is protect your electronics from mildly varying voltage swingsthose that may even be deadly to your electonics
why
because most daytoday power spikes come in the form of voltage swings above volts
for desktops and directac monitors volts is the executioners axe for themand if you only have amps drawn through your surge bar a swing from v ac to v ac is not enough to trip the protection features of the surge barkeep in mind until you demand more than amps at vor more than a sum of  watts are used or supplied this bar will not stop itbottom linesurge bars are great for lightning protectionbut if you think you have varying electrical voltage that is causing electronics damage on your system get a plugin voltage meter and check your providers supply throughout the day for a few days
if it goes over volts at any time notify them of this and start looking for a regulated power supply or voltage regulator
these surge bars are not voltage regulatorsthis surge protector does what it is supposed to do
it is designed for tvhome theater use and has the proper outlets for that purpose
i detect no interference using the cable protection
i have used monster surge protectors for all my electronic needs and the reasonble price at amazon makes that easier to doi bought this to protect my marantz home theater playstation  and samsung flatscreenoutlets are well spaced and this device protects my incoming cable service also
so if i suffer a lightning strike will it work
stay tunedlike the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical wmonster adapters
like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical wmonster adaptersi find this to be a very well built power center
of course the proof would be in whether it can really protect when that big surge hits
i hope i never have to find out
we do get a bit of static on our hd tv on occasion by running the cables through the protector
but that might be from the cables and not the protectorsince the following was written the price difference between the monster and belkin both approx
 has become decisively gaping  and  making the belkin the only sane choice
monster is premium quality at a premium price
musicians will pay more for a monster patch cord than some folks would pay for an electric piano
but on closer inspection this power strip is competitively priced
i recently purchased a outlet belkin strip at only several dollars below this monster strip
but the belkin would accommodate only  of my plugs because  of the receptacles are in a vertical row with the ground holes on the inside not the outside as is the case with monster
consequently a rightangle plug took up the space of  receptacles in effect reducing me to the same number outlets as this monstereven so why not save several bucks and get the belkin
two compelling reasons in favor of the monster the included hdmi cable isnt one of them  the color coding is a thoughtful timesaverfrustration eliminator how many times have you found yourself on the floor suddenly at a loss about which device connects to which receptacle
 the wellilluminated surface tells you at a glance whether the unit is connected and receiving power belkin units have too few or zero lights requiring the user to get down on all s to determine whether the problem is a loss of power to the stripim giving it  instead of  stars because only  of the  outlets are dedicated to those spacerobbing power adapters wallwarts
count on the remaining  outlets accommodating no more than  additional power adaptersthe labels are specially designed for an entertainment system
i like the size of this unit
the coaxial cable that comes with it us of good quality
i got it for a great price which makes it easier to overlook any flaws
if you are very organized and want to designate where each plug goes this is perfectand the labeling of what you plug in the eight receptacles have been helpful to get the cable internet tv   sound systemall plugged inthought this would be enough for the entertainment system
it is working as expected now
easy to connect and use
i found the labels helpful against each power outletthis is a must buy for your valuable purchase
in my place i have seen that the electricity fluctuates a lot
this provides protection to valuable equipmenti recently bought a new plasma tv and some home audio gear and wanted to protect my investment
this fits the bill perfectly and is reasonably priced
so far its seems to do the job  one lightning storm and no fried electronicsas with most monster products they are superior to the cheaper store bought power strips
highly recommendi give this only a  star rating because i have only started using this and i dont know over all how this will perform over time
so far its lasted about  days since i unpacked it
i would have given it a  star if i had it in use longerlegendary quality at a very low price
i personally dont care if its last years model or even discontinued it just works very well at a great costi havent had any problems but ill update if i do
nothing fancy just a power cleaner that works as advertised so farok i just installed a new lcd tv in my bedroom mounted it to the wall bought a power kit to have the plug in the closet be accessible and now needed a surge protector
this was a cheap price for a high quality product
first you have a simple way to lable all your plugs one of the biggest problems is taking plugs out this has the plugs color coded and the cord gets a label to color coordinate italso the plus work well  i have not had a chance to test a surge but i noticed a better picture and sound on my tv i think its clean power worked the other onei bought two is installed but tv works as good as beforeit was a great product and price would recommend it to put all your high tech products in a safe powerstrip small investment vs a destroyed home theatre equipment explain why you did not do it to your wife after it is destroyed
 get this now you will not be sorryi have no horror stories about lightning strikes or major power surges to tell
this does the job that i need but do not think it has been truly tested
i have  of these for various setups
there was a tv that would occasionaly just have sound no picture
replacing the surge protector with the monster model seems to have elimated the problem
when they are reasonably priced as opposed to most monster pricing i believe they are a good deal
i hope i never have to find out how good they really are or take advantage of the monster protection plangreat price on amazon meets my needs perfectly
have hdtv cable box receiver subwoofer bluray and antenna plugged in without any space issues
flat outlet plug is a plusi use this on my main ht setup and havent had any issues through numerous blackouts
i bought a new tv on black friday and decided to replace the dusty old surge protector i was using
sprung for this again   and i cant complain
im not an expert on av stuff but i usually buy monster solutions because they appear to be tried and trueive purchased a couple of these for a couple of home theaters and havent had a problem yet
im not sure about the claim process noted by the other reviewer but so far they seem to work fine
probably because my house hasnt experienced a major power surge yet do not buy this at best buy as they charge retail prices
it is much cheaper on amazonthe systems i have purchased these for have not been high end setups
if you are considering this for a multithousand dollar home theatreaudio setup i would highly suggest that you buy something nicer
why not spend the  dollars  if you insist on monster httpwwwamazoncommonsterreferencemkiipowercentercircuitrydpbaydqbrefsrieutfselectronicsqidsr  that will protect the thousands you spent on your htalthough the product is great and the protection indicator gives you a sense of security the looks could improve
easy to install and easy to mount on walls in a vertical positionits a power strip not really a lot to say
i got two of these for a very low price
monster products are pretty pricy however if you get them on sale they are well made attractive looking and have been reliable so far for me
i have several surge protectorpower strips from monster all purchased at steep discounts from list as well as some cables
they all work fine and the ergonomics are very goodwhile this is a very good product iot like all monster products is about   over priced
thee are cheaper solutions with a lower price tag
received quicklythis is a great looking item with great markings for each component
the only down side for me is it only has  outlets and i need well i decided to write a review on this product since i just had it blow and start squealingi am rating it at four stars due to the fact i have to buy a new onei have owned and used monster power surge protectors for years
i have an older model hts mkii  that has functioned flawlessly for the past  years or so in texas and ohio now
my home has had multiple power issues with storms etc in both states and never had a problem with it
i also purchased the hts  last year with a  plasma screen i bought and wanted to make sure i had it protected

well last evening as i was watching hd television through the receiver i hear a audible click followed by a loader click almost immediately and all power in the wall unit went out and everything turned off
i immediately heard a low squealing noise that i had never heard before
i followed the sound to find it was coming from the monster power center hts
i immediately thought thankful that it turned everything off and found that i could not get it to reset the fuse or stop the squealing sound
i then went on line and found a post that the another customer had the same thing happen and that it fried the unit and it would need to be replaced but it protected as intendedwell after plugging in my hts mkii  from my downstairs home theater system i found that my onkyo av receiver txsr would not come back on
this unit has been giving me problems for a while with consistently reading a multitude of different blue ray players and ran very warm could double as a space heater
looks like the receiver blew and from a reverse direction blew the receiver or the was a power surge that made it through doubtful
i just got off the phone with monster warranty department and they were very friendly and courteous with me
they will send out a claim package and will immediately send a replacement power center
i am a fan of good customer service and monster has been a  star service so far
i have a few understandable hoops to jump through ie
fill out a claims package get an estimate of repair for the receiver etc but they could be sending me a check for repairreplacement costsnow i am not patient so i have already ordered a new av receiver pioneer vsxk due to cnet reviewamazon ratings here on amazon and yes i also bought another monster power center hts
i believe it did its job even though i can not reset it which is the only reason it is receiving  stars here
i went with the same unit because of the sale price that i just could not pass up
i would love to have bought the hts mkiii  which also had a great sale price but it was almost  more and the  functioned as it was intended to protect the other valuable items in my home theaterpros  sale price customer service lifetime replacement warranty on power center spacing of outlets audible alarm and status lightscons  could not reset the uniti give this product a  because it is probably to expensive but it does hat its supposed to do
i bought it when i purchased a news  inch tv and a bose surround system and i wanted to make sure that my new stuff was safe
this product does give me piece of mind
it also looks cool and the lable really do come in handyim using the monster cable mp home theater powercenter hts to remove line noise in the electrical current to a highend tube preamp
the line noise is removed beautifully however the powercenter itself creates a highpitched tone
the tone comes out of the powercenter device directly
if you are planning to use this product on a highend sound system i recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolatedno problems to report
sockets are easy to get to and coaxial connection was a breeze
you spikes or shield problems to report
cable cutter is happygood quality low price power center with noise filter
this power center has good outlet spacing allowing for transformers to fit without covering outlets as some power centers have not incorporated this design causing loss of total number of available outletsworks well as this is the nd one i purchased
like all monster products they tend to be overpriced however with exceptional qualityi prefer monster over any other cable brand
how can i get excited about reviewing this product
i use it only as a power strip since i have a dualtuner directvtivo and a phillips lcd tv connected via component video
i understood what i was buying though so i wont ding monster for the item
it does its job and it does it well but there are no bells and whistles on this thingno problem thus far appears to be doing the job as nothing has been fried yet
have it in the garage powering various rechargeable tools
in florida brownouts are a concernthis power center provided everything i need for my home theater setup
the only feature i wish it had is a shutoff option for certain accessories to eliminate phantom powerive had one of these for over a year and just bought my second one
this is a great all around power supply
it only has monsters overmarketed clean power stage  so dont think your system will look and sound noticeably better than before
and i have no idea why theyre still including a vcr plug on this  i havent owned one of those in  years
aside from these minor quibbles id buy it again for the same setupjust built a new home theatre and used this surge protector
does exactly what it advertises allowing multiple components to be installed at one source point and provides surge protection and insurance for a bargin pricei bought this as a lightning deal and i must say it has done its job well
all the wires and unorganized appearance of my tv was killing me on the inside
the hts  has allowed me to organize the wires has enough for every plug and has tags that go on the cords themselves
i am not sure about the cable stabilization when it comes to image quality as my tv and cable box and wiring is relatively new
overall it is nice and hopefully will protect the equipment in case of power surgebefore you shell out big bucks for these ask yourself if it is really necessary
because i am a sucker for perfection i went out and purchased them
did i see a huge improvement in picture quality compared to another brand of component video cable i was using
no
at least not on my quot sony wega tv
okay maybe the black levels are a bit better
i got these because i do believe better cables last a lot longer than cheapermade ones
in addition because i have so many cables running from my reciever i figured cables with better jackets and good sheilding should cut back on video interference producing better quality picturesthis is from a fluke iii metersignal inductioncrosstalk between conductors  unmeasureablesignal loss on  data wires   ohms from pin to pinsignal loss on  distinct ground wires   ohms pin to pinsolder joints while not entriely pretty are not coldflawed in any visible waythe individual ground shielding at one end of my cable was close to contact but was not touchingoverall im pleasedthe part number is actually mvsvm which makes this clearer
not sure why amazon isnt including cable lengths in their descriptionsi used these to power my rear speakers for my home theatre set up
they are coming from a denon ci to def tech mythos gem xls
the wire is pretty flat and i ran mine under the carpet
cutting it is a bit interesting as the flat shape does not cut with typical wire cutters and you pretty much have to trim with a knife around the wire then twist it like normaloverall i am happy with the purchase
there is a small bump in the carpet both by feel and visible but i have a low pile carpet and not the best pad
if you have thick pad and a medium to high pile carpet i would think this wire would be barely noticeable under them
served its purpose and was easy to work with
thinner than regular wire of same gauge a little
i would recommendi set up a new home theater system and used the superflat to connect my right left and center speakers rear are wireless
i love the meltintothewall offwhite hue and the flat jacket lies almost flush against the wall
the wire is soft and pliable and easy to work with bends around corners like a champ and is easy to cut and strip
flat wire jackets might be tricky to strip with a cheap strippertypical rat shack round hole strippersbut theirwin industrial tools  inch selfadjusting wire stripper with protouch gripsmade short work of the flat jacketthe included pins are a bit too small for my taste
they really look like pins and were a struggle to squeeze this  gauge wire into
surely more surface area is better for signal conductivity at the speaker and amp terminals
also the amazon product photo shows banana plugs but the description says pins
i should have read the description more carefully
luckily i have plenty of banana plugs so i installed those instead
finally although the included wall anchors work great monster was really stingy with them as there isnt nearly enough for  feetthe superflat sound and look great but i dinged them a star for the stingy terminal pins and wall anchors and the misleading product imagethis worked just for what i needed it for to split standard cable signalwas a little expensive compared to others but look at the name brand lolmake sure it supports the signal for what you need
some people may need ones that go above the ghz but it all depends what you are using it for
for standard cable works great
for cable modem digital cable or sat tv do research for your provider first and make sure it will be fine for youwhile im no big fan of typically overpriced and overhyped monster products ill readily concede that this beats any of the  or  other splitters i tried
i see comments here from users who say they cant see a difference with this product my comment to them is that they need a better tv
i also noted one reviewer who somehow heard that this splitter cant be used with catv it can and ive been using mine for over a year with my digital cable hookup
advantages less noise and grain than others ive used and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable companys free piece of junk
most notably this splitter maintains excellent image contrast and has no visible chroma effects that i can see
few splitters can manage all this
the only product ive tried that might beat this is a  job whose brand i dont remember probably because i aint spending  on a splitter for any reason
even if youre not crazy about monster in general youll get your moneys worth here
im using two in my setup with a celabs booster ampi bought this along with a monster cable now i know monster is way over priced but i think this splitter is worth iti wanted to hook up my cable modem and my cable tv with no loss to my cable modem and it did what it said it wouldi wont give it  stars because i know its the point many people need to understand when purchasing a splitter is that spitters split you signal
every split that occurs reduces the quality of that signal
buying a better  ghz splitter such as this one may reduce the loss of signal quality but do not expect miracles after all you are still splitting a signal without adding any power yourselfthe splitter probably will not improve quality in the following conditions you replace a splitter with a better one but your tvs already have the best quality they can with the split they have you replace a splitter with a better one but the tvs require a rather low signal anyway so any split would go unnoticed the signal arriving at your house or apartment is already weak in which case the splitter would not do any good you are adding a splitter to a system that does not have onein these conditions you may see the best improvement have a high signal demanding system such as digital cable tivo and hdtvs have your cable split to the limit very low quality video when normally splitting have an internet line one of the best parts of this splitter is for internet usagetv splitting may see an increase in speed of internetgiven these criteria in mind i had a good experience with this device
i moved into a new apartment which had relatively bad signal
i wanted to split it three ways into my computer tv tuner my digital cable box  tv and a tv in my bedroom
i purchased this teamed with an  db signal amplifier what actually does add power to a system
the signal clarity improvement was minimal which i believe is because my apartment building does not have a very good signal before it even reaches me
however before adding these devices i could not plug into my computer without completely losing my signal to the point i could not watch it
this was of course with a cheaper cable company provided splitter
after replacing the splitter and adding the amp i could set my computer up and have all three devices on and using the cable without seeing a single drop of signal degradationthink what you will but i say this device is a noticeable improvement
it all depends what you think a signal improvement is worth and taking the chance that you will meet the criteria for the signal improvement
there is no for sure way to predict if a better splitter will improve your video quality
you just have to try it and find outappears to work as advertised and is currently being used to connect two homerun and one tv
all signals appears to be the sameitem works good works even better when connected to another splitter that works in the  ghz range
i noticed that when i used a lower end splitter that didnt support ghz it did not work as well
so match up all your splitters to be the same kindive read some reviews on these discs
they serve their purpose
the colors are cool but need individual boxes
that way theyll be more compact
ive seen my discs fall out of the flimsy dust free caseso far there are no problems with the discs themselves
its great that you can record about x on them
at least if one breaks it doesnt cost a lot to replace them
theyre less thaneachactually my discs say theres  minutes of recording time
well i cant say much more
if you like memorex products get these cool little discsdid my review help you as the title says the only potential drawback is that the minidiscs dont come in individual plastic cases
they still come with larger multidisc plastic cases that are just fine for carrying discs aroundthe hardware is great the provided software could be better except for the driver which is fine
while browsing and email work fine i like to be able to ping from dos and this port is blocked for some reason
if you have windows  second edition i would only install the driver then set up file and print sharing manually and use ics which comes with windows  second edition to share your internet connection
but i love the cards themselves
get a linksys befsr router and a linksys homelink broadband bridge and you wont need to use a pc at all in order to share your internet connectioni have a small office networked with these cards
works fine for printer and file sharing
cannot get it to share online connection
what really has me puzzled though is the fact i had two of the computers at my house networked with the same cards and they could share the connectioni used one for a couple of weeks now
so far i have noticed no problemm is great
but since m is available now at a great price get m insteadi cant say much for or against this card
it is not flashy or quotusb enabledquot does anybody ever use that feature anyway
but it does exactly what i expected it to at a reasonable pricethe  meg card by viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space
this card allows me to shoot over  x shots with my canon elph sthis seems like an excellent value for the money but it is not quite as good as it seems
after receiving it i learned that it only has mb of space on it
perhaps they are cheap because they had some defects that make mb or so unusableit works fine
i would just divide the price by mb instead of  to find the true valuei would also highly recommend using the viking pcmcia card reader for compactflash
it simply shows up as another drive in windows with no driver software to load
you might get a deal by buying the memory and card reader togetherthis card including the rebate is the best value for a  mb card
i did not notice any differences between this card and my kodak cf card in terms of speed of transfers previewing pictures on the camera or reading from a card readeras noted the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within  days of the purchase date
if you get super saver shipping youre really cutting it close
i did not make the deadline since i put it off a few daysi bought the mb card  mnths ago
at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller
finally it gave a error reading card  message and stopped working
customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt
they replaced the card is  days
they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered lost in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it
i was impressed with the excellent support but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life
would i buy it again
yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as welli have enjoyed using this card
occasionally every couple of months my camera nikon coolpix  will give me a message saying there is a problem with the card but when i turn my camera off and on everything is fine and no data is lost
i dont know how common this problem is but since it is occasional it is not worth it to me to get a new card
i enjoy the extra memory this card provides just enough for an amateur photographerviking may not have the greatest reputation in the world when it comes to their memory but ive personally never come upon anything of theirs that left me feeling unsatisfied
this mb card is a great value for the money especially with the rebates
transfer times are what youd expect theres nothing that makes this stand out of the crowd other than the price
but just make sure youre aware of the space capacity youll really be needing  it just isnt roomy enough to keep up with any cameras over mp
however its a solid and dependable backup that i always have with me whenever im out shooting with my mp camerai bought this one in   years ago
i still use it every week and it works just like it did on day i was able to take  digital images both day and evening flash shots with my olympus dz over a course of a  day vacation to los angeles and san francisco
the olympus takes  aa batteries
i thought i would need a nd set of batteries but the first set lasted the whole tripgreat for vacations when you dont want to lug around a charger and a spare set of batteries however if you take a lot of pictures with your digital camera it might be wise to invest in two sets of rechargable nimh batteries and a portable chargeri use my emap for topographical maps
with the  meg of ram i am able to  download the areas covering the appalachian trail from west virginia to the  southern end in virgnia
that takes about  megplenty of room for other  regions as well
because gps signals are so weak the antenna needs to be  exposed to the sky to keep a good signal
the flat back of the emap makes a  strip of velcro easy to apply to allow mounting of the unit on the shoulder  strap of a backpack
the features arent as numerous as the garmin iii  but it covers all the basics and provides a large crisp screen
i havent  tried the dash mount for my truck but it looks like it would do well in  that environment as welllate this summer i was driving a rented minivan from mendocino ca south to the bay area
its about  miles
i was with three other adults and three children
instead of taking the recommended rt  southeast to rt  and south to the bay area we decided to take a shorter route due east on lake road to rt  to rt  then south
well the road we chose went through deep redwood forests
more often then not we could not see the sky
there were times when the road was no longer paved at times rutted
it was so narrow that for most of the way it would have been impossible for two vehicles to pass fortunately no vehicles came our way
the road often snaked around tree trunks as large as  feet in diameterthis road was on both our aaa map and gps i had preloaded the corresponding map onto my mb data card from the metroguide cd
the going was very slow and our shorter route soon became the longer route
we were too far along to turn around
my wife seated in the back held the portable phone ready to call for assistance
i asked all to wait to put her trust in the gps
after another half hour we came to a threeroad junctionall narrow and unmaintained
one of the roads was not on the aaa map
intuitively it looked like the least likely road
but the gps indicated this road would take us to the rt  we took it and before you knew it arrived at the conventional rt  the gps saved the dayone of the greatest attributes of a gps is that it allows you to explore to go where you normally would not and discover new vistas
obviously my emap proved thatbesides this general function there are several specific features i like about the emap
these include its portability and its ergonomic design
the emap has a relatively large display which can be backlit and it is light just over  oz
when walking with this unit in a town or on a trail i appreciate being able to hold and control the unit with one hand while always having the display in view
this is a result of the control buttons being below the screenthe emap is compatible with garmins downloadable mapsource cds
these include us roads and recreation worldmap us topo and metroguide usa with the mapguide usa cd the emap can look up addresses and telephone numbers for nearby services and points of interest
i like being able find a particular restaurant or street address by entering it under the find feature then tracking it
an arrow will point in the right direction and distance will be displayedthere are many available accessories several which i recommend
i needed a larger data card
the unit comes with an mb card which will give you one region
this is okay if you will be using it in a limited radius
if you go elsewhere youll need to load new data using a serial cable another accessory
it is time consuming which may suggest your getting another accessory the garmins usb data programmer
i have a mb card which captures from massachusetts to maryland  regions
using the serial cable took over two hours to load the data
using the programmer took about four minutesi definitely recommend this unit
its portability versatility its adjustable detail and its accuracy give you the confidence to venture places without getting lost
one suggestion thoughdont give up the paper map
use it to provide the fuller perspective a portable gps lacksi have used the emap on several driving trips along the east coast and found it easy to use and the base map fairly accurate
but i purchased the roads amp recreation cdrom and found that maps in the north carolina  region are over  years old
i contacted garmin and they confirmed that no  updates have been published and they have no policy regarding providing  updates to the maps
while i like the functionality of downloading more  detailed maps into the gps investing  in obsolete maps and a company  who doesnt seem to view this as a problem bothers mei purchased a refurbished model of the garmin etrex handheld
i received it within the stated shipping period and in excellent condition
upon opening the package i thought there may have been a mistake
the shipped unit looked brand new
no blemishes or scratches anywhereworks and tested flawlessly when tested next to my cuda  i purchased the handheld to be a backup for when i used a different kayak or travel to another islandit took a bit of fumbling around to figure out all of the nuances
although the manual was included who reads the manual anyway
a recommended product if you want a backup or want an entry level handheld gps
no bells or whistles needed unless youre into that sort of stuffthe only complaint i have is that it goes through batteries fairly quickly
i find that batteries will last about  hours which is not good if i take a  hour trip
yes i know i can bring more batteriesfor my first gps i selected the garmin etrex
easy to use to mark waypoints and find them later
have not had to use it in the dark yet
setting up routes is nice just to know the distance between two points
i recommend this to anyone who needs something lightweight and simplei am still quite new to the magical world of gps
i should add that i have used the little garmin but dont own one
this i hope cools a bit the potential excesses of owners reviews
i will divide my remarks into two  groups i general considerations about quotvaluequot gps ii opinions  about the performance of this productabout i id say that this is a  good product to start with
it has no map download ability
yet i used to  locate points in a city i dont know well to find your car in a praking  lot and to find my way back after a long drive
i cant really say how  useful such device is for hicking or sailing although i believe it could  be a great help
having a map of your cityarea is much more useful of  course but portability and cost suffer
finally this is a great firstaid  device and a very enjoyable toy many functionalities like speed etc
are  not that important still they add to the funabout this specific  system the jury is still out
the case is very resistant and handy but  the ergonomics is less than excellent
we are all used to front buttons for  portable appliances like in cells phones and palm pilots and garmins  seem awkwardly placed and just dont feel right
the screen is ok but ive  seen brighter screens
another drawback of the system is the limited  battery lifespan
 hours is really too shortbefore i buy my gps  ill try the magellan  which unfortunately is not offered by amazon  yet
it similarly priced slightly bigger with larger buttons and  longer battery lifespan
i would appreciate if some reader could send me  their experiencesyet all in all this is really a great toy useful to  commuters and hickers alike and still quite affordable
as a gift id  recommend it without hesitation
but if you are a conscientios consumer  id suggest that you explore all your your optionsi really have no major complaints about my garmin etrex lovingly called the yellow etrex
the interface is simple and the unit is small and lightsome may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the thumbstick for easier interface navigation
i was one such person and i have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the updown buttons that youre limited to with the yellow etrexbuyer beware when it comes to used yellow etrex models
many versions of it were sold that were not waas enabled
you can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disableenable waas
if not youre looking at a slightly less accurate model but if the price is right for you it shouldnt matter too muchmainly interested in snowmobiling and offroading in lebanon i would have given the etrex a five stars rating which it deservesbut it has two weak points that prevented me with doing so
first it has no software and no cable shipped with itfor the v cigarette lighter cable the data cable and the software cd youll have to spare at least and addtitional usd  to get the most out of the etrex
one of the strongest points are the features you get for a relatively low price the great yellow shape no messy antennaand the autonomy on two alcaline batteries
overall the etrex is an impressive product
my next step is the garmin summit
and this goes to people from garmin quotyouve got yourself some additional brand loyaltyquoti bought this device for my brother who likes to hike and fish
given the reasonable price i thought it would be a nice introductory gps device
if your needs are simple and you dont need map functions this would be a good choice as a starter unit until you decide if you want to invest in a more featurerich gps unittomthis unit works as they say
i only need it for location coordinates and it works great
i tried setting markers and waypoints to find my way back to a starting point but the unit seemed to want me to return in a straighter line vs the one i walked
many other features i have yet to use and may not need as i only need a location point
for the money i got what i paid forif you are looking for a basic gps this one is for you
i use it for hiking and fishing and love it
it tells you haw far you have travel and at what speed
it tracks your progress
it allows you to save up to   waypoints
the only major disadvatage is not being able to download maps  but since most maping gps units cost over  i will take it
i was also  looking at the magellan  they are very simular but for my needs this  one is perfect less expensive and waterproof
i highly recommend this  uniti received mine yesterday
it works fine
for some reason it took serveral minutes to get a signal the first time though
just a warning if you are an impulse buyer like me
the amazon add has details on the product and it shows a color display
that is the etrex venture cx model
the one here is the basic
i was expecting color
my bad for buying so quickly without reading
duhalso i expected a data cable
any other product on the planet comes with one if needed
i just bought the cable today
with shipping it was 
i didnt expect this either
again
my badim sure ill have fun with itthis little gps is about as simple as it gets
i have had mine for about  days now and have found it to be very useful
keep in mind this is a basic unit as it cannot have maps uploaded to it
however it does what it claims to with effeciency and accuracy
i was amazed that something this small could locate me in my car or while walking
i do lots of outdoor photography so this unit is perfect for marking spots that i want to come to again
i am already pretty good at navigating myself around most places one of those gifts god bestowed upon meso the etrexs simple design and use is perfect for meif you are light hiker or are just getting into the world of owning a gps the etrex is perfect for you
if you desire an onscreen map then a higher end model will be more to your likingmy only fret with etrex is its inability to pan around your track that you create
you are only able to zoom in and out
hopefully a future driver update will fix thathappy trails  tamonbefore you lose the patience to read through the rest of the stuff i would strongly suggest that you get yourself a pc interface cable and download free gps software from  or pay for one at  with additional featureswith so many gps in the market it is confusing which one to buy unless you are clear about what your needs arei jotted down a few points as to why would i really need a gps never to lose my bearings on hikes keep track of where i went and share this data to others keep track of altitude get to know of sunset and sunrise times so that i known when to get back to camp and when to start the next day speed at which i walk and estimate the amount of time i would take to reach my destinationetrex satisfies all of thiswhat is that i do not like about the etrex altimeters are not accurate in any gps so get a barometric altimeter in addition to a gps something miserably wrong with sunset and sunrise timings
my gps shows sunrise time as  and sunset ast  
and it is inaccurate even if you transpost it
etrex loses a  for this useless in heavy tree cover in any gps battery life could have been betterdespite all that i am very happy with my etrex it cost me exactly  meets almost all the features that i am looking formany of my friends ask me this question  are you sure that this gps works in india ofcourse it does it is a global positioning system 
i have used it in us canada singapore and korea and works everywhere even in the forests in western ghats in indiathis works fine for me
the only reason i wont give it a five is because it does not exceed expectations but it certainly meets all of my expectationsi bought this mg card at costco and i like it for the most part but when played in my mp player i have some problems with the music flickering on and off once in a while which does not occur with my  and  meg card
but it really doesnt bother me since i only paid  at costco
its a great deal considering this little piece of memory has like  times more ram than apple iis from the si was starting to develop rsi in my hand and arm from mousing
i switched to the trackball and have been tracking for over three years with the same trackball with no problems
i have the original nonwheeled model and it has remained as smooth accurate and responsive as the day i took it out of the box
i use the wheeled version at home and im almost as pleased with it
the ball action is just as glassy smooth but im not a fan of the wheel
it is rather clunky and its action is way too firm to use as a middle button
i find it difficult to click without accidentally scrolling
otherwise this is an exceptional product
as for gaming action i attribute my status of fragmeister to this trackball
there are few things more frustrating than running out of mouse pad in a firefight
this never happens with a trackball
updateits now been over seven years with the same trusty trackball
i love this thingi like logitech products and this was no disappointment
it worked well
unfortunately i had trouble learning to move the marble with my thumb and ended up going back to my original marble with the marble in the middle
i am sure that younger unarthritic people will love the ease of use with this particular marble wheel mousei started using logitech trackballs several years ago and have never been disappointed with them  in fact i find it hard to use computers that have traditional mice
recently my trackman marble gave out and i replaced it with the trackman marble wheel
i found it to be a quality product as wellhaving used a trackman before my thumb already was conditioned for use but i still had to adjust the mouse settings in the control panel to make sure i could reach all parts of the screen
i have a little difficulty because im missing some muscles in my right hand but i can still use the trackman well
i also appreciated the customizable buttons  the wheel doubles as a third button which i use as a doubleclick button
there are many other options available including the ability to switch the click and rightclick buttons if you wish
i was disappointed to see that logitech didnt make this a fourbutton mouse i would have liked to see the three original buttons from the trackman marble design remain and have the wheelbutton be a fourth button
also i found the wheel to be a bit more difficult to use as a button  i tend to scroll as i click from time to time which causes me to open things i didnt want to openthe wheel is very valuable  i found that i missed it immediately when i went to a computer without one
the wheel makes scrolling much easier in applications and you can set the scroll amount from the control panel as well although you may have to find a compromise because you cant set the amount separately for separate applicationsthe quality is excellent
you certainly wont have to clean it as often as traditional mice although it still needs to be cleaned periodically or more often if youre into diablotype games
cleaning is easy  just insert the tip of a pen into the little dot on the mouse and with a turn the retaining ring pops out and the ball can be cleanedyou can use this in a usb port or as a ps mouse however if you plug it into a usb port understand that you may have difficulties if you have several usb devices or if you have an intensive device like a zip drive connected
ive rarely experienced problems but on occasion if my zip drive struggles it locks up the mouse as well
this is more of a usb issue than a logitech issue though as you can tell from reading the iomega zip reviews
just keep it in mindive never felt bad after buying a logitech mouse and this was no exception
the only suggestion id make to logitech is to design a lefthanded trackman marble
i like to divide my home and work usage equally especially when a diablo ii or icewind dale is released and you cant get one of these for a lefty
other than that i give it high marks and would definitely recommend itnot sure about range  i go outside with them but cant go real far
receiver is sitting on the tv
ive had them for some time
only complaint i have is that the aaa rechargeable batteries i have wont work in them
i havent tried lithium batteries but i plan to
for the price they do a pretty good jobthis product have a great design good sound in my cdplayer and tv but in my dvd player i get some static the same in the home theather i think dont respond good in high quality frequence the reception is good in  all the room bad and good in the rest of the house but whit this  price im so happybased on the deal i got  i cant complain
i have an average size head   but i can see how they are tight on the ears and could be more comfortable
i simply slide them forward so they are more on my temples
i wore them for  hours with no annoyance
the reception was good once i dialed them in and havent readjusted them yet
i walked around the house and out to the street and didnt lose clarity
i did lose it when i had  walls  drywall and  brick but i dont plan on listening to tv out in the driveway often
for the money they were worth it and i can stay up and not bother the sleeping kid or wifei purchased this vcr as a gift for my parents
theyve been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now
it has had no problems and has functioned as expectedthe controls remote and hookups were easy to figure out with enough ins and outs for the basic av system
this vcr functions much quiter than the one it replacedi cant recommend this vcr
the sound of the vcrs motor is very loud and is annoying
also it can not record in the lp mode
lp delivers a much better picture than the ep modeive owned  panasonic vcrs each one better than its predecessor
i am not sure that the same holds for this one though the price is certainly too good to pass onif youve owned a panasonic vcr before then you expect reliability and ease of use
this unit delivers on thatwhile including  heads commercial skip a lighted remote finally
 and the entire bevy of features now standard on every vcrthe real negative is that it is much noiser than the model it replaces particularly when it is rewinding
we are talking a good bit noise enough that it makes me want to turn up the tv volume while it is rewindingi actually went out and purchased a jvc vcr to consider as an alternative but returned that one and kept the panasonic becaese the jvc was way too confusing to programso why did i keep this one
it is very inexpensive i like the features and i can live with the added noise
i think this one is a keeper unless the noise will drive you crazyuntil it broke
the repair technician said the laser pickups were made by samsung and a steady stream have been coming in for repair
it would cost to replace so i might as well buy another player
ive had the unit for almost a year now
great picture useful zoom for those toowide movies and adequate remotehere is the deal  maxtor drives aredrum rollpretty good
i would say they are a midmarket product
the price is pretty decent the technology is there and the drive sizes are thereyou could drop a small house payment on a high end array of harddrivesbut to be honest i have never had a problem with a maxtorare they louderi dont know i really dont set up on the decible meterhow do they benchmark
who knows  benchmarking is the digital equivalent of horse handicapping
generally it is right on the money but who ever is doing the benchmarking can skew the results the way they want
and every once in the while that longshot old mare comes in at  to  and all the other horses forgot to take their steroids that daydid you ever notice a company that puts up a benchmark where their product isnt number one
hmmm did a magazine ever put a product benchmark where the top five didnt have an advertisement in the magazine
am i cynical yesbut you get my pointnow the big one
do they break or are prone to errors
no more than any other drive that i used be it lowend or highend or just rightisnt that why they tell you to backup everything anyway
or is it like that tag on the mattress  people just get a thrill by living dangerously and ripping it offdo you think you wont need this much space
you will if you store mpeg  sound files video clips and graphics
you may find that you are  collecting these things before too longthis drive will make an  average computer into a serious entertainment systemi like maxtor ive  never had one fail in  years working in the computer industry
i rate  them in the top  or  of drive manufacturerswhy only  stars
it is  not a must have product
i still like it and would buy another onei installed this in addition to the existing gb drive on my  year old computer
it would not work using my computers original ribbon cable but when i used the cable that came with the new drive everything was fine
all and all i am very happy with it
and now i have gb instead of  which is greatafter living with a tiny  gig drive for several years i saw this drive on special
i snatched it up and have not had a problem with drive space sincethe drive installation is simple and fairly easy but you do need to have some understanding of the guts of your computer
after plugging in the power and drive cables and closing up the case within ten mintues i was back up and running with more space than i knew what to do with
since i am using this on a mac i cannot comment on the included softwarespeed wise the drive blows away my old  gig
faster access and startup is always a good thing for any computerif you have a older computer this is a great upgrade for it
sure compared to newer drives the capacity is somewhat small
but most people really dont need hundreds of gigs for normal useive had the dl for around  months now and overall its functioned flawlessly
the pictures are crisp with remarkable detail
i do have one critisism however the battery life is appalling    this thing eats  batteries
i have found that not using the lcd display helps a little  though
all in all a great little camera for a good price
just make  sure you have plenty of spare batteries with you on your trips or buys  some rechargablesfor image quality i was quite amazed by the quality of the pictures produced by this camera
at high quality jpeg you can get  pictures on the mb card and presumably with  the mb card   that wouldbe   pictures
with the lcd off the battery usage isnt too badeither
i also find that the closeup pictures the macro mode is also quite good though the flash is overpowering in these situations
ill probably experiment with a flash diffuser possibly something as simple as a piece of white paper over the flash in these casesfor macs though be prepared to work through a few problems
first of all the cable that converts the pc serial connector to the macintosh serial connector for older macs like mine isnt in the box despite the label on the box which indicates that its mac compatible
theres a coupon you can mail to get this connector free but it should be in the box in my opinion
for modern macs one would probably have to buy a usb smartmedia card readerknowing this however i also bought the sandisk flashdisk  adapter that allows you to read smartmedia cards from your floppy disk drive also gone in modern macintosh computers
it too claimed to be mac compatible but it too lacked any actual support in the box
there was no software for the mac
i had to download the drivers from the internetthen i found the drivers claimed that os was necessary i was running os 
i was able to read single image files off the flashdisk but not two or more
i installed  but found i had the same problem
i was subsequently able to download multiple files when i directed them to a subdirectory instead of the desktop
i cant say for sure that this alone was the cause of the problem but at least the whole combination workedxs are somewhat unsatisfying of course but xs made with the camera are really good
it would probably make passable xs
overall im quite pleased
olympus lost a star for a somewhat complex user interface and no mac cable in the boxive owned this camera for almost three years it does everything youd want a digital camera to do  takes great pictures with reasonable quality flash works well settings are useful
its weaknesses   eats batteries for lunch  serial interface is rather slow  setup requires that you read the manual and youll need to read it again when you want to delete all your pictures after you download
valuable options  the acpower pack and a mb memory card
do you really need a megapixel zoom for 
are you an avid shutter bug
no
then consider this camera in the  rangefirst off buy several rechargeable batteries when you get this camera
as  soon as i got mine we played around with it offnon for no more than  or   hours before the brandnew alkaline batteries were useless
flashes and  the builtin monitor really suck em drynow besides that the olympus  dl is my first digital camera
now im not really great at taking  pictures so i put most of the settings on quotautoquot and hope that i  can photoshop them into looking better later on
the picture quality is  good overall but if you want any sort of details captured youll have to  use the largest pixel size available and zoom in too
so forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from  rows back
most of my work  is on the internet so its great for web publishing but i doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out  but i havent  really tried yet eitherthe compact design is quite good so i cant  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week
i  know ive carried mine around in my roughntumble book bag for weeks on  end and it hardly has a scratch on it
if you want to change the cameras  settings theres a lot of button pushing to change the shutter  whitebalance and image file size options
my friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes or to  zoom in or to take the picture over again because i flashed when i didnt  want to
and theres a slight delay between when ive pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic
quotcapturing the momentquot often takes  a couple mintues to prepare
also the pictures ive taken often look  fantastic on the lcd monitor but are fuzzy when i download  themdownloading is a snap  sort of
just install the software once  then hook the cable up to your serial port and  wait
it takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures
heck it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor
the editing software included is  okay but its no photoshopthe very first weekend i had it i went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze
surprisingly most of the photos came out great  very  fun and colorful  except when the flash goes off people often have red  eye which is fixable through adjustments or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts
and if i didnt use the  flash then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light
it definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the flyin comparison though for  the price you pay here you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device
the lowlight photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black
i havent yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose it always seems to automatically compensate
also the multiphoto quotpanoramicquot option and the quotaction  sequencequot modes are fun to play with but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run
on one mb card you can fit about  big  files but tons of little photos
and remember rechargeables  rechargeables rechargeablesi love it
easy easy easy to use and the picture quality is quite good
i just wish i could figure out how to use the digital zoom
the menu option could be easier to navigatethe battery life is very good and the picture capacity is goodall in all i am quite pleased with it and glad i bought itive purchased three of these for family all beginners with the digitals
everyone still has and uses their camera
they are compact and light
great for emailing picturesuse the quothigh qualityquot hq setting for the ones you want to print
prints look good but a good printer helps
be sure to browse the manual but once you brush up its easy and funi like the camera alot although i had to send it in for repair ccd went bad  caused a thin blue line to appear in every photo  i noticed another reviewer had that same problem
fortunately the warranty was still in effect  yr
tech support guys were were courteous and helpful but customer support was not  something olympus needs to be aware of customer service rep was rude also emails never returned
colors in photos are very bold and brightim glad i got this camera
ive been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera
i use a variety of digital cameras at work and know  how useful they are
this one had the price that i wanted to pay and the  performance of  cameras from a couple of years ago
the colors look  great
the software is a breeze to use
the quality of the camera seems  to be very good so fari would have scored this camera  out of  if it  came with a case and a usb connector
it is slow to download with the  serial cable
i still havent been able to take any good photos at night  firework displays city lights full moon etcim planning on  purchasing a case a  mb flash card and a usb readerone of the best camerias that are super
i say buy it
yes the amazon prediction is correct
a  have the cash than buy itthis is an outstanding digital camera  you will not be dissapointedstrengths excellent picture quality intuitive user interface and menus can use as point amp shoot or can tweak options like iso and flash speed for more advanced use included smart card holds from  imagesweaknesses serial port download of images is superslow although getting the usb smart card reader via rebate will solve that problem no ac adapter or rechargable batteries includedi bought my olympus  on line and saved over x  off the average selling price for this camera at the time
i have owned my olympus for about  years and have yet to have the first problem with it
like any electronic device getting the feel of it takes time and practice
but i carry it with me most always use recharchable batteries upgraded to higher smartmedia storage cards and bought a basic usb card reader mounted to my computer with velcro to upload my pics
its fast and the software is easy to use
this camera is a good buyvalue and i will be using it for many more years to comei just can recommend this camera for everybodyits simple to use and makes good quality picturesif you are professional you can buy something more advanced but for everage people this camera is very goodive had this camera now for almost a full year
it was my replacement for the dl from olympusnegatives  not many
my biggest pet peeve is the battery low indicator is not as accurate as id like
the camera actually begins to lose functionality long before low battery is displayed
and the camera goes downhill very quickly
but the symptoms are more like the camera has lost some functionality and not others inability to zoom but still able to focus
ive just become used to replacing the battteries as soon as i start having any strange issuesits not as small as id like
the dl was a great size for a camera
this one is still too big for my liking
id like to have something that really does fit in my pocket like the size of my cellular phone would be goodpositives  get the mb memory card and you can take photos for  what seems like foreversuperb lowlight capability good focus excellent color fantastic resolutionmake no mistake this is a great camera
it takes good pictures in a variety of lighting situations
it has two problems the first is that darn lens cap gets lost easily the second is that the view through the viewfinder not the lcd display doesnt accurately represent the frame
both can be solved one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice but they detract from an otherwise excellent product
i also like the ability to record a short audio segment on each picture this is enough to describe the scene so that i can remember it later try to remember everyone at your wedding for examplei had a hard time deciding between the olympus  and the nikon  in the end i choose the olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature
i bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family
i really like how easy it is to take basic pictures
family picture takers will like this camera
it takes great pictures easy to transfer using usb and comes bundled with great software
the camera is also very compact  its about the size of an average point and shootthe only thing that i would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible
it is relatively easy to use but i have not mastered making quick changes yet
a great addition would be a quick menu system in the top lcd area instead of having to power up the monitor
or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes
you will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features
they are not that intuitive for a nikon slr userif you are buying this camera you should also get extra memory and batteries
you should also invest in either an external memory reader or the ac power adapter
i havent tried rechargeables yet but that may be my next purchaseafter owning an olympus  zoom and now the olympus c i would honestly say that the quality is pretty much the same
with both cameras many indoor shots had be be quotdoctoredquot in adobe photoshop
levels need to be adjusted and then the photos are just great
outdoor shots are great
i did notice that battery life with the  was considerably more than that of the  rechargeable batteries are essential with any digital camera
i really like the quotmovie with soundquot function of the   smart media reader buyers  beware if you have an amd processor
after much research i have found that a pentium processor is essential and your reader may not work with an amd
camera appearance very professional looking
for the true photographer this camera is a must
for the amateur the  works quite nicelyif against using rechargable batteries and only want daily planner with some ebooks games andor thirdparty software this one is for you
out of all of products available at the time palm iiixe is the bestthe batteries x aaas will last you about a month
on you first day itd probably last you the day until the newest wears offi used the iiixe mostly as a stand alone which means i didnt use my pc to hotsync maybe a few times
and i rarely had any problems the only problems id encountered was from bad thirdparty software
i never had to hard resetyou can go to palms website to download the palm os  upgrade which i recommend if you plan on using some of newer  thirdparty softwareso if you dont want much but an inexpensive palm os pda that waste batteries instead of electricity with enough memory to do what your daily planner could do and play games like monopoly and solitaire and read ebooks then this is the ideal purchase for youor you go with a new palm zirezire for less than there are many other reviews that get into the technical aspects of the  palm iiixe
i just wanted to share with you why i bought it and how i use  itthere are many good reviews here
i didnt want to spend too much  money so i didnt want to buy a palm v color palm or pocket pc
i feel  that pda will only get better in the next couple of years and i dont want  to feel guilty about upgrading laterhowever i was willing to spend a  little extra money because this one had mb of memory
i also considered  buying the handspring pda but my company would pay for part of my purchase  if i palm pdai use microsoft outlook at work and home
i never had  much success with using a daytimer
it was a real pain to write things  down in the daytimer and then type it into outlook
it was also a big  waste of time to write my outlook meeting into my daytimer
worst of all  i hated lugging the daytimer everywhere i go
the palm pilot is a very  nice solution
you dont have to duplicate your efforts and it is very  compacti use it to synchronize my pc at work and home
i dont do  email with it i prefer using my pc
however i do use it for scheduling  contact lists and tasks
i also like the memo feature so i can make notes  to myself
it is nice to jot things down on the palm and then synchronize  it with you desktopi also like using the avantgo service
if you  havent heard of it go check out   it lets me download  stock quotes the weather sports scores bbc news wall street journal  slate and the new york times
it comes in handy when im are on a train  or in a waiting room or airport
it is a lot less cumbersome than a  newspaper in a crowdi purchased two accessories for it   a palm  palmglove neoprene case  this is a very nice case great protection and it  is waterproof
 a palm hotsync cable  its cheaper than the hotsync  cradle
i use it to synchronize outlook on my home pcgraffittis ease is definitely overrated
graffiti is not that easy to use
i am definitely thinking of getting the keyboard to type in the huge amount of data addresses and such i need to reference
also a downside  not really mobile like the palm v  this was my first outing with palm  after being paper and pen for years and i would say that the palm is  really worthwile if you travel if you have a lot of contacts and if you  are going to use iti just bought this pda used from amazon and im pretty pleased with it
its not color which i dont care about but i am having a bit of a hard time seeing the screen well
i have had a terrible time getting it to synch correctly with outlook and i couldnt get it to synch at all with palm desktop   no clue what the problem is but after  hours trying to figure it out i just gave up
i use outlook express not outlook and it took a lot of trial and error but i can get it to synch names and addresses but i can not get email to work since i dont use outlook as my default mail handler
soif that fits your situation and you want to synch for email and download from avantgo then do not buy this
however i just want it for names and addresses to replace an old trusty sharp wizard that they dont make anymore
i really loved my sharp though
what i like about the palm iiixe is that its batteryoperated  aaas i honestly dont even fathom why people complain about this feature  theyre nuts
the battery operated pdas are the way to go because they can last forever in your purse and you dont have to remember to charge it
if the battery is dead while youre on the go  just run to a convenience store and buy aaas
that simple
the palm iiixe seems pretty sturdy but well see in the long run
either with palm or sharp this beats carrying around a paper and pencil organizer
the person i bought from on amazon was great and honest tooi have owned this palm for about a month and it is very easy to use and very helpful
the computer software that comes with it is great and a must for the sales person or busy exec
that needs organization me you wont go wrong buying this palm and for the price it is a stealabout  months ago i was in the hunt for my first pda
deciding that i wanted to go the palm os direction i had the choice of going with either the iiixe or the vx
boasting roughly the same innards the decision came down to form
since i was willing to part with a little more money at that time i decided to go with the vx
let me say however that had i chosen the iiixe i would not have been disappointed at allits a great palm with upgradable os
something its palm iii brothers could not domy only gripe with this palm is that it is quite large
it is just as big as something i willing to carry in my pocket
since i planned to bring my palm with me where ever i go and i dont carry a bag my pocket would have to be its main form of transportation
with an added case that would have made its overall size even biggeroverall i really like this palm
it has that classic look and is still one of the more powerful palms available
i would pick this over the ms any dayas a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any pda
dont believe the pocketpc ads or even the palm ads
talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who arent on palms or microsofts payroll
unfortunately they will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to knowgood lucki purchsed my iiixe almost a year ago and compared against the v and vii it was the best bang for the buck at the time
the  megs of memory means that you have the ability to load a ton of the ton of the third party software available for the palm platform
the screen was about the same quality as the v and vii and those two models were a lot more expensive required constant docking in the case of the v or had the additional expense of wireless internet viihowever that was a year ago
today the iiixe is still a good value but having seen the screens on the iiic and color handspring unit i would lean towards one of those two models
there really is a nightday difference in eyestrain between a color unit and monochromeother than that the iiixe is still a great value even though it lacks the handspring expansion and the clie and tigers ability to add more flash rammany of the words of wisdom given here are correct
while i havent had to replace the screen yet it is a known problem in the palm iii community
however i must say that the mb of ram the size and the price make this palm an unbeatable bargain
i find i cannot get through a day without using it in some waythere are a number of software packages out there that help out i personally recommend tealscript to allow adapting graffiti to your own quotstyle of writingquot i also recommend the metal stylus pack if for no other reason than to have a handy reset tool without lugging around a paper clipas far as palm pilots go this is a  unless you want color
palm is popular and easy to use so there are plenty of programs for it
grafiti the custom writing style is good but difficult for me due to poor finemotor skills
as such a few letters require several repeats to get
my wife is much better with the writing portion than i am
i primarily use this for reminders phonebook and notes
side use is multiclocks for travelling and various video gamesi loved this product
it kept me organized and ontime
syncing was a breeze
and as always with me the price was right
i used this until i upgraded to the palm z
it would have been nice if the screen was backlit but thats one of the reasons i upgraded to the zit is a great feeling to carry around your palm and always have  information in your pocket
i use mine with avantgocom to always have  something to read
i load a few ebooks on
i also have it linked to my  micorsoft money applications so i can always keep track of my finances
how great are these things
pick one upmine is older than dirt now serving as a backup
it has proven itself to be reliable sturdy except for the flipopen cover and easy to use
of course the software available is incredibly diverse making this a very useful tool in business travel and entertainment egs
financial spreadsheets airline schedules s of games
i get months out of  aaa batteries even with frequent use of the easy to read backlighting for the screen
i would say that you cannot go wrong with the palmiii though the price makes other brandsmodels worth considering tooi owned or perhaps it owned me a palm personal for four years
it died earlier this month rip
even with only  meg of ram i never outgrew iti am impressed with the storage capability of my new iiixe
the infrared is cool since my family and coworkers also have palms
although  the iiixe is an upgrade in specifications however i liked the personal  edition better the personal felt more durable and the screen didnt squish  under the stylusi have heard a lot of reviews telling me that the new  iiixe screen is so much clearer and higher contrast than the older models
i think the new screen is much more difficult to read than my personal  model
im not so sure that i am satisfied with this new unit but ive  become so  reliant on the palm that ill have to keep it
i cant justify  the money for the color upgradethis is a well thought out product and a great quotperipheral  brainquot
there is an incredible amount of software available for this  productmany of it free on the net
i work at a hospital and use it to  store phone  but it also has an entire pdr and other medical data on it  i was able to download off the net at pharmaceutical and medical sites
i  also looked at the new pocket pc which i found to be very good but for  right now this is a cheaper pda and does the jobthe palm iiic organizer is one of the smallest color handhelds on the market and fits neatly into your shirt pocket or purse
a rechargeable lithium ion battery lasts more than two weeks with normal use and  recharges in your hotsync cradle in just minutes a day an optional  recharger kit is great when youre away from your pc
you can also charge  up during auto or air travel making this the ultimate organizer for road  warriors and mobile professionals alike keep your meeting times  contacts and other information organized in this elegant device with an  active matrix tft color screen for stunning fullcolor data display the  palm iiic handheld also supports any of the thousands of applications  already available for palm handhelds with new color applications available  for download every day use the hotsync cradle to quickly backup and  exchange information between your pc and your palm handheld as well as  many popular pims like symantec act
and microsoft outlook with the  palmmodem accessory you can access your desktop pc remotely in just  minutes using a standard phone line

palm provides a couple of addons though that show off its  capability
like the picture viewer
in the past months ive seen a rapid  conversion of apps to support color
from datebook software  datebk  actionnames  to spreadsheets  tinysheet  to games  too numerous  and  webbrowsers like avantgo
then there is that little handy program called  chrome that allows you to customize colors even the standard apps
btw
this is what i love about the palm platform whatever need arises there  will be someone to write a piece of software to address it
in any event  even if rd party software has not been converted yet it will still run  but show in bw
this is a good example of how palm doesnt leave its  customers in the cold imho
even with the new os there is backward  compatibility got that bill
i found the color screen a pleasure to  use
the black on white screen is very readable for ebooks
palm is  working with adobe to convert their pdf reader to palmos so cleartype  technology will be available on palm soon
the screen is really bright i  had to turn down the brightness sometimes because it hurt my eyes that was  good ofcourse since it increases battery life
the screen looks vibrant and  can be read even from an angle as opposed to the color screen on the hp  jornada
outside the screen is hard to read because the bright light washes  out the colors
this is a common problem with color screens
make sure  whether you will use your pda inside or outside and consider the screen you  want in that context
the screen is somewhat pixelated due to its x  resolution
however it doesnt hurt the eyes or tire youbattery life  was acceptable
on a  week business trip i had to recharge it only once
you want to keep the brightness down to preserve battery life but that  shouldnt be a problem since the screen is so bright anyway
you will get  less battery life if you are outside a lot because you have to turn the  screen all the way to be able to see anythingthe downside for me is  size
i dont care what anyone saysyou can not comfortably carry a palm  in a shirt pocket
i carry it in my pants pocket with the v i would forget  i had it until i needed it
the iiic its just always there
for that  reason i actually returned the iiic and got the vx instead
ofcourse this  is a personal issue i can  only recommend to hold both a v and iii in your  hand and decide what you can live with
too me the v is the only  acceptable formfactor what good is a pda if you dont always want to carry  it with you
if its uncomfortable carrying around youre going to start  leaving it home
however if you really want color the iiic is still the  lightest and smallest color pda around with the longest battery lifelets face it the main reason to purchase this model over the other offerings from palm or visor is the colour display
unfortunately having used both the iiic and the vx im underimpressed with the quality of the image on the iiic
it is colour which is a pretty neat change to palms previous greyscale models but i find it much more difficult to focus on the screen image
it seems to flicker quite a bit and gave me a headache after using it for an hour or so
i found the screen on the vx to be much more comfortable especially if used for a long period of time
the palm operating system is wonderful much easier to use and more efficient i feel than windows ce but id go with one of the bampw models for the time being
also the iiic is much thicker and less stylish than the brushed aluminum case of the v series which may be something you want to consider before purchasing this modelthe palm iiic is fantastic
i dont know how i ever got along without it
i was going to buy a vx but the resulting headache after using it for  about  minutes and my wonderful wife talked me into the great color  screen on the iiicthe unit is lightweight handsome functional and  very easy to use
installation and setup was quotoh so easyquot  the  writing recognition isnt flawless but is very good
definitely better  than any windows based apps ive used
it comes with  core applications  that will simplify your lifedate book address book todo list and  memopad
my wife can enter honeydos into the palm windows software on my  home computer while im at work so when i get home and hotsync the iiic  theres no way i can forget to pick up the bread and milki keep the  palm iiic with me all the time
there are many accessories to make the  palm quothandyquot for you to carry but im using a velcro camera  carrying case that attaches to my belt and fits the iiic like a  glovethere are thousands of third party applications you can download  off the internet
my favorites are the epocrates pdr a physicians desk  reference and totalcarc to easily keep up with all maintenance and fuel  cost of all your vehicles
if you wonder what youd ever use a pda for  just search the www for palm software and youll find more useful  applications than youd ever had believed possiblealthough this keyboard shows up in the search list for palm ms palm insists that the curved shape of the ms bottom is not compatible with standard iii keyboards folding or otherwisewhen palmpilots were the rage this folding keyboard was cool
it was designed well and worked flawlessly
only it came out just when palmpilots were about to disappear from visible use
looking back at it there was some irony in using a full keyboard like this just to create long documents in the device that could then be loaded at a later time to a pc and sent in an email
at the same time it was easier than carrying around a laptop
looking back at the intended use one didnt expect to be able always to send a document immediately as has long ago become the normi think ive had a palm v ever since there have been palm vs
now i actually have two
despite that im not really an enthusiast
for the most part i use the device for phone numbers and notes
im not particularly fond of the graffiti alphabet and generally make my notes using a sketchpad utility or the internal keypad
the palms advantage as far as i was concerned was that it was not a laptop ie i could slip it into a pocketabout a week ago while travelling i wanted to write a review while the book was fresh on my mind and i had no access to a computer
i did have my palm with me so i decided to write the review using it
i quickly realized that palms are poor tools for writing anything else but short notes
since i still had no desire to buy a laptop i decided to pursue another alternative first and bought the palm portable keyboardafter a few moments of sticker shock i found myself in possession of a strange boxlike device that unsnaps and folds itself into a keyboard with a stand for my palm v  it only took a few moments to get the software for the keyboard loaded down to my palm and then suddenly i could have a palm with a keyboard any time i wanted
considering that it folds down to less than the size of a paperback the keyboard itself is nearly full size
action is pleasant and positive
it feels a bit flimsy which is not a surprise and needs a firm surface under it
given the physical limitations it is a tidy piece of engineeringthrough some ingenious use of special function keys the keyboard can not only enter all of the graffiti characters but also do a pretty good job of replacing the pen for many functions
dont plan on getting rid of the pen completely though
there are still places where only the pen can perform the needed command
for my purpose writing long memos the keyboard is perfect
despite its price its a pretty ideal palm accessory
if you use you palm mostly for keeping your schedule the keyboard is less useful and can probably be done without
its nice to have the option available howeverwhen directv changed from xm radio music they switched to such an inferior selection of music i had to do something
i had all the cds about fifty that i only used on road trips
now i have the music i what all the time
the only misrepresentation on the product is that there is no light in the access door as illustrated
other that that it works fine
one note i would not recommend playing any multidisc player on random
the reason is the volume changes from old cds to the remastered
jclove the fact that the changer can store up to  compact discs
i am currently a third of the way there
mostlyi play it on random mode
recently random mode does not work as well as it did compared to when i first got itthe player is telling me no disc when i know i have a disc in the slot
if someone out there can help me pleaselet me knowive had a previous model the pioneer pdf also a  disc player this comment is for the pdf since january  and its never let me down far as i can recall
i chose it over a sony  disc player at the time the deciding factor being that the pioneer supports the time remaining feature on the playing track when selected whereas the sony player did not support the feature
i think it was a handsomer unit in addition the lcds being yellowish rather than the glaring hot white of the sony
i paid about the same as this newer model sells for nowi never use random play so cant speak to the complaints here about itthis player supports cd text and that was an important factor in my decision to buy
more and more cds support that now and ive always burned cdrs using that feature inputting the data including track titles when the original disc doesnt include it
its a crucial feature in my opinionthere are search functions but i rarely use them
instead i have a database of recordings ive inserted into the player from which i print reports
so i can find what im looking for in a snap entering the slot number on the remotespeaking of the remote well my eyes arent so good
early on i made adjustments to the remote cutting out sticky dots arrows pointers numbers pieces of yellow tape what have you and affixing them to the remote sometimes with clear plastic tape
i never mess with that stuff now but its all there and it helps me find the functions i use most very quickly
i was kind of lost without them
it would just be a mass of black buttons to me without themthe only lacking features that come to mind are the inability to control headphone volume from the remote
the to me inconceivable necessity to delete cd text for a slot whose cd text supporting disc has been removed from the player
put a different disc in the player in that slot and if it does not support cd text the player believes that the newly inserted disc has the text of the previous disc which is bonkers
well it only takes a  minute to manually delete the info for that slot from the memory of the player using the remote tapping the keys but it shouldnt be necessarywhile trying to resolve some issues in my upgraded home theater setup ive had to look up things from my new and old components
i was very surprised to find that the pdf cd changer is still being made after all these yearsi bought mine some time in early  to replace an earlys  disk model that died
yes it has cdtext capability and you canif youre patient enoughload in some info on each cd
rather than do that we got some of those big binders to hold the liner notes and numbered each slot with a sharpie
this makes the cds easy to find by number
we have a third binder to hold our overflow cds and sometimes rotate them inanyway our cd player has gotten a fairly active workout for more than a decade and still works just like it did on day one
it seems to have its own personalityalways picking out my cds versus the other halfs when on randombut has never failed us
pioneer used to issue new fleets of components every year or so changing the numbers as they went
who knew they stopped at this one for the cd changer and never changed it
obviously it worksive owned this changer for about  months
my main fear of buying a large jukebox such as this was whether it would work  reviews on amazon and elsewhere of sony and jvc carousel changes seemed to indicate that failure rates were highi was very excited about the cdtext feature  with so many cds in the changer an onscreen display of the cd titles without manually entering them seemed like a good feature
unfortunately the changer only seems to support the title field
i wrote some scripts for linux to munge the title field to include the artist but since most of my music is in itunes and not on a linux machine i eventually quit bothering with cdtext altogether it would be nice if itunes supported cdtext and just burning the cds from itunesmy solution is that i have a print out listing of the cd slot locations
not elegant but it works wellanother concern i had when buying this changer was whether it would work with cdrs
after reading reviews of other brands that claimed the changers were scratching cds i knew i was not going to put my original cds into the changeri can happily report this changer works fine with cdrs
ive never had a storebought cd in this changeri have an optical cable from the changer to my receiver the sound is wonderful
other reviews have mentioned hollow sound from this changer when using the analog connection and im inclined to agree
use an optical cable if possible
regardless it sounds as good as my other two  disc changers if not better they are not high end gear thoughother reviews have complained the changer is slow  for me the only place where i feel it is slow is when detecting that no disc is loaded into a slot
actually changing out one disc for another seems rather fast though of course there is a delay but its probably not desirable for the changer to be throwing discs around quickly afterall
speed is not really a problem for me with this changerconstruction is solid and the remote is well laid out and compact
this is my only pioneer component but i am very happy with iti have had this for about a month now
i must say for the price it isnt that bad
it has a lot of settings that you would need to constantly play with because of all the choices and some spl setting you might want to set for some movies regular channels etcall in all it does the joboverall ive been pleased with the  the only drawbacks are disappointed in the manufacturers claims about standard aa battery life usually mins is average not the hour and half claimed
nimhs are a must i use mah which usually lasts  hours at least
get real nikon ship at least nicads sure its a cost issue but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for  mins or less
 the manual is weak but is typical of translated manuals
 accessories are hard to get hold of and the remote release is expensive although its feature loaded an ir or rf based remote would be nice most other camera makers offer them
 suffers from red eye a lot
 low quality software on the pc even lower on the mac crashes often on wink even after the update to camera firmware and pc software crashes on first time use everytime
 menu access is slow camera could do with a faster cpu latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better
 one very small thing that would only affect a few people is the inbuilt ir filter for the lens which means you cant do the near ir style photography thats popular with other digicamsother than those small quibbles its generally an excellent camera its a lot of fun to use
once you are setup with nimhs and a decent sized cf card its easy sailing weve had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it
pictures taken are great the jpg compression levels work wellthe low is very low quality suitable for web pictures but the high end is good and the highest setting with no compression is excellentoverall i love this camera and would recommend it especially considering the price you can get one for nowhowever here are the cons  redeye problems
nearly every flash photo has redeye
i have read that this is because the flash is too close to the lense
however fixing redeye on your computer is easy so its a tolerable defect  although the camera body rotates its not quite as userfriendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the canon g  resolution
i always shoot on fine but still end up with some photos that im not crazy about the resolution
pictures with lots of detail turn out great but where there is less detail you end up seeing the little dots
although people say a  megapixel camera approaches film quality i disagree
i see the pixelation even on x printsconclusion  ill continue to use and love my nikon  until i save enough to replace with a  megapixel camera like the canon g or nikon i owned this camera for about  months and in the time took over  photos with it yeah i know too much free time
i used the photos for onscreen presentations as well as xquot printouts
the camera takes just incredible photographs with accurate colors and very sharp definition
here are some other points i sawautofocus was fairly quick during the day but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light flash powerful but nothing you do can get rid of redeye in virtually any shot redeye reduction mode is uselesscamera can store photos in separate folders which is useful for multiple occasionsno support for microdrive is a fatal flawmetering system is extremely accurate found virtually no need to use the spot metermacro ability is second to nonefor dentistry takes wonderful intraoral photos utilizing the chair light and the builtin flash not terribly good though if you want to focus on one tooth since the flash will wash things out
the resolution is good enough though that you can focus on a quadrant take the shot and crop it lateroverall found it to be the perfect camera minus the redeye problems and lack of microdrive support
so i sold it and bought a canon powershot g review forthcomingthe nikon coolpix  represents the pointandshoot digital technology almost mature
the shutter delay is hardly noticeable and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly
batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time
however the quicktime movie capability is a little awkward  no sound  and the color of the images seems to always be a problemhowever if youre looking to buy a digital pointandshoot today this is the camera to buy
the independent rotationallens design is brilliant
you can point the thing at yourself and view your selfportrait as you take it which by itself makes this camera  a standout in my book
add to that the topquality optics and dazzling array of features and this model is the one to beatgiven all that for the time being ill stick to my filmbased olympus stylus epic for most of my shooting onthego
the nikon is too big too slow too energyhungry and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the olympus doesive been using this camera for years now doing digital  photographywhat makes this camera great is the lens you can get wide angle  fish eye which lets you make  degree panoramas with the help of software like vrtoolbox and panohead from kaidansean b hallidayill admit it im a technojunkie
i have to have all of the newfangled gadgets that are out there
call it compulsion
i bought the creative nomad ii for the sole purpose of having one but after i received the product i came away with a product i cant help but be pleased withfor such a small device the sound on this gadget is incredible
i cant believe im listening to an mp from such a small device
lets forget that the smartmedia card i have holds  megabytes a feat on such a small card is just unimaginable to me
you can control the treble and bass along with  presets rock pop classical and jazz
best of all the skips are very rare
unlike what most people have said here ive had one or two
nothing major but a few for some reason
the battery was full if youre keeping score at homei love the voice recorder
this innovation automatically makes the nomad ii a more useful tool outside of listening to music
with the capability to record  hours worth of sound bytes with a  mb card you could record a hour lecture transfer it to your computer and keep an archive of them without worrying about having enough tapes or missing something in your notesi only gave the product four stars for a variety of reasons
even though i marvel at the size of the smartmedia card in relation to the memory on it im always afraid im going to snap it in half when i place it in the nomad ii
if youre careful youll be fine
im afraid that if i break it i might have to shell out another  or so to replace it
i also found the navigation to be a bit hairy in some instances
then again i have a big thumb so take that comment with a grain of salt
i also did not lkiek the fact trhat i had to buy a separate docking cradle although amazon does have in my research the best price for itoverall this is a great product
if you want your mp player to do more than play music get this item nowtripods should be reliable inexpensive cmon its a tripod sturdy and easy to set up this pod offers it all
an attractive little number it is very lightweight only  or so dollars a snap to set up and very sturdyespecially in this quotsnap and goquot world a good cheap buyi have been using this flash for couple of years
it is a real work horse
like other flashes in this time period it makes high pitch noise as it rechargesthe shoe mount voltage is enough to fry the modern digital body  you would either need a shoe mount adapter or remote trigger
i use two flashes using cactus  remote triggerummmmm i have been using an old vivitar  from the s on my lumix g digital camera and it seems to work just finewhen people talk about  volts and frying the camera  if i had to worry about this would it have already happenedthere are many bad reviews about this usb kit but i decided to try it anyway
i have a laptop that has not serial port and a palm iiixe
well i went through the installation and everything went well but at the last step it would not synchronize
i contacted palm support and in a few hours yep not one day or two days but just a few hours they sent me an email with the solution
and it workedhere are my suggestions to others who want to give this usb kit a try my laptop runs windows se btwdont use the cd for the installation of the drivers look to the right and choose the palmconnect usb kit software for your oson the download page they include installation instructions that vary a little bit from those included in the cd
make sure you follow the installation instructions on this web pagebefore you synchronize make sure that the hotsync software has local usb and local serial checked
this was the solution to my problem
to make sure these options are checked right click on the hotsync icon on the system tray and see if local usb and local serial have check marks next to them
now synchronizethis should do it
 it worked for me
everything runs aokayi just got the case
it has a nice feel to it and is very well  constructed
im happy with the purchase
this price is very  goodprosheavy duty zipperwell madegreat  protectionstylishconsno belt clip
i dont really miss it but it  would be nice to free up my hands and stick it on my belt
but then  again i will look less like a geek
makes palm iii more bulky
difficult to keep in pocketnot much room inside to store anything  besides a business card and a couple of scraps of papervelcor mount for  palm iii not very securethere is nothing spectacular about this case but then again it has no serious flaws either
it is relatively inexpensive does its job and cleans easily even baby spitup
ive given several away to colleagues and clients and they have all been happy with themnotice the quotpricequot clause inserted in the heading
that is because after using intellimouse explorer logitech mouseman wheel optical and this one i would say the logitech one is the easiest to operate and best built
however its also twice as expensivethe pros compared to intellimouse explorer its smaller and so fits people with smaller hands the extra two buttons which are placed on the left hand side on the explorer are now one of each side so you dont have to flex your thumb as much the surface is not as shiny as explorer so makes it easier to grip the optical technology is faster so it feels more accurate than explorer did i mention its cheaper than logitech mouseman optical
 unlike intellimouse explorer this works for both right and left handersthe cons are this depends on the user but i found that logitech fits my palm better than this one the side buttons are loud
it makes a loud plastic sound the construction seems flimsy especially compared to logitechs
maybe the reason for the loud side buttonsthis was the best money ive spent for my computer besides what i spent for the matching  ms internet keyboard pro
this mouse beats anything that logitech currently offers and ive been a fan of their mice for years
this mouse has control ive only dreamed of and has excellent adjustment  software
theres only one reason im giving this mouse  stars though  and that was the installation
i felt queasy switching over from a ps  mouse to a usb mouse and i was right
it took me about five reboots and  two software reinstallations before i got the mouse to work right and i  could take the old mouse offline
if you are a beginner computer user you  might want to have someone who knows what to do install the mouse for you
other than that this product did what it claimed to do and moreoptical mouse are great because you dont need a mouse pad they work on any surface and they seem to be more quotaccuratequot
they also suffer less from dirt or dust which is a major problem with the quotregularquot mouse
this particular mouse fits well in my hand and works great even though i have dropped it regularly by accident because my work space is less than idealhowever i have found a drawback
i travel extensively and have been taking this mouse with me
lately i have noticed that the usb connector is not working so well
i do not appear to have the same problem with other usb connected devices so i suspect that the connector on the mouse is quotnot what it could bequot in terms of heavy usage
if you are basically going to plug in your mouse and leave it this will not be a problem
if however you are like me and will regularly plugunplug the mouse throw it in a briefcase and let it rattle around this may prove to be a difficulty over time
i have traveled with it for approximately six months
interestingly i have swapped it for the one on my laptop basestation and both are working fineso the connector is not completely worthlessjust a little sensitivei am a very heavy computer user and leave my computer on x as many of you surely do
i loved this mouse except for its ocassional tendency to jump to one side of the screen but when it wasnt doing that it was the best tracking mouse i have ever used
but when my second one broke i decided to go back to my old standard microsoft ball mouse
i dont know if i just had bad luck but i would recomended it if mine hadnt broken
i guess my final comment is happily purchase at your own risk
good luckmaybe it is the full size hand form  you just rest your whole palm on top  or just its good shaping but after years of sore wrists im back to using a mouse
my substitute had been the track balls and other alternative input devices but none seemed to match the mouses easy of use
the optical also eliminates the mouse pad yes no more gifts please and the shuffling you have to often do in order to get traction
very good product and none of the wrist crampingi got this mouse for christmas and so far i love it
after getting used to a wheelie mouse at work and not having one at home id been meaning to pick one up for some time now
this mouse moves extremely smoothly over my mousepad and has a cheerful looking red light shining out the back palm end
the only complaint i have with the mouse is that the two side buttons are too easily pressed while just moving the mouse around especially when you have to pick up the mouse and reposition it
you have to make sure to grab the mouse at the base below the buttons while youre moving it around or picking it up
still the side buttons are quite useful for web surfing
the thumb button takes you back a page the finger button takes you forward
of course the button action can be customized to suit your needs with the intellimouse software
definitely a worthy addition for anyone tired of cleaning out those gunky rollerswhile it may seem a lot to pay for a mouse there is one circumstance when an optical mouse is just about priceless  using one with a laptop frees you from the touchpad andor pointing stick and gives you back the intuitive function of a mouse
you can use one on your leg on your tummy on a picnic table if you are camping out on a desk if you are a student etc
if you are using a notebook as your main computer these days invest in an optical mouse  you wont regret itmy one major objection the the ms optimouse is the always on led  it needlessly uses up precious battery power on a notebooklaptop
i also find the side buttons useful but overly sensitive  they should be recessed
and i much preferred the ivory white color of the previous ms micethis mouse has great optical resolution  dpi which results in extremely precise pointer movement
the shape is fairly comfortable and the button placement is well thought of
i especially appreciate the  buttons on either side of the mouse which act as back and forward buttons  for the internet browser
the plain beige color is also nice if one has a  plain beige pc setup like i dothere are however a couple of problems  that i encountered
because of the lack of support for the right side of  ones palm the pinky finger could get sore after sustained mouse use
the  previous generation ms mouse does not have this problem it seems
also the  optics would not work correctly on certain type of surfaces any surface  that is shinnyreflective or too complicated like a photographic mouse  pad the pointer will jump and skip pretty regularlyif one does not  mind the ergonomics of the mouse and use it on recommended surfaces this  little device is about as good as they comeit took about  reboots for it to finaly work  which i shouldnt have to do with a usb device
ive put in usb scanners and such with less work
still  im happy with it
works great
i went from a trackball marble to  this intellimouse  im not yet sure which i like better but i think it  will work better for games and photoshopi bought these specifically because i was seeing a production of the musical wicked with my fiancee and we had cheap but horrible far back balcony seats
these binoculars made the show enjoyable for me
i could make the detail out of every costume set piece and character face from at least  feet away from the stagei recommend these for that extant
im not a spy or bird watcher so i cant speak of this product for that usagethe binoculars were well constructed and suited my  year old grandson
he is very happy with the product
good purchasei was looking for a pair of binoculars just to be able to look at the birds and animals closer
i decided on this repair because of the price and good reviews
its a good pair for the money and works well for what i got them forbought this one because my simmons binoculars had a broken hinge
it is bulkier than simmons but it works fineno complaints so far
its pretty clear to look through and the amount of zoom is decent enough for most applicationsgreat magnificationlightweight  folds somewhat compactly
used it to see radio city spectacular sitting in the rafters
turned my seat into an orchestra seat
i got to see the rockettes as  foot giantsjust a couple of concerns sometimes it enlarged too much i had to lower them to find what i wanted to see
also be wary of dim lit places or you may not see much through the lens
certainly pleased with it
the amount of money i saved from purchasing the least expensive seat over the pricey orchestra seat more than covers the price i paid for these binocularsdoes what i need it to do
if i want to look at the mosquito on some bald eagle from  yds away ill opt for something more like overall know your application and what you need
try out fancy ocular enhancements at any fish and game store before buying and being unsatisfied
remember try before you buythis product is durable meets specs and good for the price paidi bought this mainly for sporting events
my other binoculars were heavy and big
these have a belt loop on the case and can also be carried in my front pocketi have no issues with these
they magnify pretty well come with a little nice belt loop case and a good value for the money
the only issue is that the eye pieces are really small so when i press my eyes all the way to the optics they dont work that great i have to back my eyes up a little and of course the cord is bad and dont really see a way to replace itbottom line cheap binoculars that will get the job done small compact then these are what you want
if your a professional that relies on crystal clear comfortable magnification probably notpretty good binocular
overall i like this model as it is very portable
maybe it is me but i found myself having to readjust them often and it was a but annoying
for concerts or venues like that they are easy to cary and hang around your neck without a lot of weighti purchased two of these for the jeff dunham show and they worked well
we could see clearly from the balcony and you could hold them up without tiring as they are very light
they lost a star because the design causes eyelash flair the eyepieces could use a redesign
pity they could not help the sound  the acoustics at the long beach pac are the worst i have been to in many years and i go out a loti use it for theater and sports
it does a good job
good optics
the build is somewhat rusty and cheep
the neck strip is way too thin
the focusing ring provides for a reasonable distance range
overall  very good value for the money
ive seen better optics and better build however at a much higher price
for the casual user or the casual use i strongly recommend iti asked for the bushnell powerview  x  binoculars for christmas because i wanted something compact enough to carry into concerts and plays but high enough magnification to get up close for things like football games and nature watchingthe binoculars accomplish that purpose fairly well the case is fairly inconspicuous and has a belt loop to carry it on your hip and the binoculars themselves are smaller than my open hand when folded up
the problem with having a higher magnification in a small body is that its harder to keep the image youre viewing steady however
the smaller field of view with the mm objective exacerbates the issue as well
knowing what i know now i probably would have gone with a  x  set of binoculars instead
yes theyd be much larger to carry around but the slight decrease in magnification along with the doubling of the objective size which determines how much less or more you can see at once at a given magnification level would have led to a more enjoyable experience for my usesbut my own ignorance aside my only real gripe with these binoculars is the focusing
the main focusing roller works well enough though having since used a rockerstyle focuser i much prefer the speed and viewingstability of that type to having to roll the focuser back and forththese binoculars also have a separately adjustable righteye diopter focus however
i had never seen this feature before getting these binoculars so i searched the internet to find out its purposefrom binocularscommost of todays binoculars will allow you to separately adjust the focus on one eye usually the right eye with a diopter
this is done to compensate for differences between your eyes so you see the clearest image possible through your binocularsto make the diopter adjustment pick a distinctive object to focus on that is beyond the close focus distance of the binocular but not too far out in the distance
initially come to a sharp focus on the object using the center focus of the binocular with the dioptercorrected eyepiece side blocked off or that eye closedonce youve got the first eye focused as sharply as possible close it and then open your other eye the one on the dioptercorrected side
carefully without moving the center focus of the binocular see if you can improve the image sharpness through this eye by slowly moving the diopter adjustment back and forth
once youve found the setting which gives you the sharpest image note it and leave it there  youre done
from this point on you simply use the center focus to adjust both eyes while viewingnote you should properly set the diopter adjuster when you first use your binocular make note of your setting
check the diopter setting on your binocular every so often to be sure your eyes havent changed
always check it whenever you share your binocular with someone else
the problem is the diopter adjustment has no way to be locked in place once set on these binoculars
inevitably it always gets slightly turned when im getting the binoculars in and out of their case passing them around to let other folks look through them or simply carrying them around my neck with the included cord so i have to reset my focus nearly every time i use these
highly annoying especially when carrying them outdoors and hoping to get a quick glimpse of wildlife thats on the moveoverall id rate these  out of  stars
i like them but i dont love them
the form factor is good the optics are nice enough for the price and they are light compact and easy to carry without looking like a wandering tourist everywhere you go
if you can get past the focusing annoyances perhaps lightly gluing the diopter adjustment in place or making sharpie marks on the adjustment ring and binoculars body after setting them to more quickly realign them each time theyre a good buy
just make sure you really want and need the  x  magnification if youre getting the same pair i did as  x  is more of the common every day size i see most casual users with at sporting eventsi was pleasantly surprised that this binocular is well constructed small and therefore more likely to accompany me on hikes and outings
oh and very affordable as well
focus is smooth images bright
it comes with a cheap but functional vinyl case with belt loop and velcro closure
i can recommend these optics
of course the reader should consider that this assessment is based on the purchase price compared to features and quality receivedi wanted to have a set of binoculars for shooting at the range about  yardsthis set works really good and is clear
one lens seems to have a distortion on the edges but it did not impact when looking directly at somethingthe  is a tight zoom on objects at up to about yards
i could see each hit on a  yd paper target with a  caliber rifle
i went to  yard and i could see larger caliber holes on the target but i would use a spotting scope if going out that farmy main purpose was for  and air rifle competitions for my son and also to have it compact enough to carry when i go out horse back or hiking
the larger mm lens brings in good light and pulls objects together welli got my set discounted by having a restocked item
it works for my needs
high power in a compact set oh i had one problem
the focus dial some how got stuck and the adjustment for both lens got out of sync
i started to panic but i just dialed back to the top and pushed it a little firmly until i could see under the binocular that the lens guides were back in line
it has worked with no problem
i dont know how it got stuck other than i had the really skinny neck strap string wrapped around the binocular tightly
the neck strap is a little thin and should have been a little thicker or softer
oh welldecent quality optics at a decent price
it always takes me a little while to get these adjusted just right so im not seeing double but once i do they make looking at the moon or other stuff way neater
glad to have them in my car for whenever i need themtook this to the police concert
worked great
comes with a case easy to carry magnification allows you to see properly in any lighting conditionsthese binoculars are great for average users
well worth the price
they are powerful enough to give you good closeup views that usually require much bulkier and heavier binoculars
they are compact enough to make them very portable and come with a nice soft storage case that can be attached to your belt
the focus works well for me but you do have to have a pretty steady hand to see clearly
i sometimes lean on things if necessary
they can fog up in high humidity conditions like most others do
i think you have to pay much more and get larger ones to get past these issues
overall good quality for the price compared to others on the marketit takes just a little bit of adjusting to get it focused but it is fine for me to use whenever i need itwe got these to watch humpback whale migrations here in hawaii because those whales dont get that close to shore usually
these are nice binoculars but they are pretty powerful and as such are hard to look through unless you steady them on something while looking
just holding them in your hands they are difficult to use for my purpose
if i rest them on the car though i can see whales just fine
i am not sure i would buy them again though because for casual use they are too annoying to usethe real value of this binocular is because it is so compact
it could fit into your pant pocket and still give you a useful tool
it has x magnification and the image is quite good compared to other binoculars in the same price range
it also has a rugged look and feel with a nice rubber casingthe only problems that i find with the binocular is that x is a bit too unsteady to hold with your hands
so i find myself leaning on a nearby support in an attempt to keep the view from shaking
also due to the small objective lens of the binocular the view at night is not as bright as it could be on comparing with a binocular with a mm objective lens
these are not really problems of this binocular but are limitations due to its size and magnificationin short these are quite impressivea bit dim obvious given the size but my pair focused sharp as a pin and is rugged
if you look at the other reviews there are bad ones  of the time or so
i take those for true qc from china is dicey
these are a proper set though great resolution solid build flat and good color for the price
i would just roll with it if i got a bad set send back or get another
even at x the price its a good deal
bear in mind if you buy an x bushnell or olympus or nikon and spend  the view will blow this away
still this is great for the money
i found them to have much better optics than the tasco  ones i got at walmart
those were superfuzzyacross a lot of the field and dimmer
bushnell gives you a deal
handy for museums street signs light travel concerts playsif you spend a lot of time looking go for some nice xs or xsi was debating between these or thetasco essentials x binocular blackseeing as the specs were almost identical
i got both
this could very well be a copyandpaste of my tasco review but that would be very redundant
the differences are the tascos feel more sturdy
theres not a durability problem with the bushnell but the tasco just feel more solid
the tascos have a longer span of adjustment in both the center focus and the diopter
the bushnells focus is just fine for me but its nice to know that the tasco can adjust to a wider range of eye types
the carrying case feels more durable with the bushnell
both cases close with a velcro strip but the bushnells are made with a more sturdy material
both will attach to a belt but the bushnells stitching is betterboth binoculars come with a lens cleaning cloth and it seems the same for both except the color
typical size and quality of lowprice optics but they do the job
both binos have the same neck strap which is rounded and will prevent them from falling off your neck
just dont use the strap for steadying the binos dont pull the binoculars forward while the strap is around your neck to keep them steady because youll probably snap the cord
both have rubber armoring which is better than nothing but nothing to really brag about
both have folddown rubber cups for eyeglass use again nothing to write a lot aboutin summary theyre both great optics for under 
theres a one dollar difference but i prefer the tascos
id give this a  star if i could same as the tascos but its hard to beat either set for the priceedit after being stored in its pouch in a rucksack for almost four months the eyepiece with the diopter the right eye piece came off
it can be superglued back on but you have to be careful that you dont glue the diopter in one placei originally purchased these binoculars for use at the opera
trouble is the magnification x is too high for that use
these binoculars are more suited for outdoor use such as watching birds or planes landif you are looking at similar binoculars youll notice that other brands such as pentax tasco and even bushnells camouflaged version of these binoculars use a different mechanical design where bridge has two separate pieces and the front piece moves to focus
this design however seemed a bit more robust as the bring is one piece and the moving parts that focus are better shielded from dust and other elements
that is one reason why i chose this particular modelthese are a good pair of binoculars for everyday use not great
if you are serious about frequent use consider a more expensive brand with better optics
but for occasional use or use by a child these will be finefour stars for a good product at a good priceonce you get used to it this binocular works really good you cant get those for that price anywhere else even china towns sell them for  or moreas far as low priced binoculars go these are fine
the focus knobs in the center and on the one eyepiece move smoothly and stay in place after youre focused and the price was right for what i got
they are small enough that i can shove them in my coat pocket and they are inexpensive enough that i dont care if they get lost or accidentally damaged
they have a nice weight and feel to them for the price they dont look or feel cheap even though they were inexpensive
i would however buy a higher magnification next timenice for small glasses all my mother  can carry now on her bird walks works fine
great price for small glassesi got these for travelling around and hiking
they collapse very small about the size of a pair of rolled up socks and have clear lenses
they are perfect for the casual user and are at a great price
i cant be more happyfor the price they are ok you can focus and adjust to your eyes width
my kids used them once for a playi got these along with a bird identifier book to start watching birds around where i live
for the money theyre a great buy but i regret not going for the bushnell nature view ones that are supposed to magnify light to look at feathers and such
i also wear glasses and they dont comply with those to the best extent
i would say these are a good secondary pair of binoculars to leave in your car or ones to bring when you dont want to worry about ruining themwhile its not a great binoculars you get what you pay for
for its price its good
dont expect to see clearly through it however
if you want to see well  get better quality glass and light gatheringi bought these for use at live theatre and concert events and they work perfectly for that
they fold into a compact size that fits in pocket or purse and they have the right power
if you want a binocular for sports or if you usually sit in the fourth balcony of large theaters or arena shows you might want to get something more powerful but for most live events you will be happy with thesenot the best optics but very portable and affordable
ive seen people pay more for toy binoculars for a kid
i got these for on my motorcycle where space is a premium and they are small and do the job
easy to carry with you too because they have a case that attaches to your belt
i would recommend them to anyone who has ever needed binoculars and not had a pair with them because they are too big or heavy to carry
just dump these in your wifes purse or in the glove compartment in case you need themgreat set of binoculars in such a small package more than what i expected
nice weight and balance
very comfortable eye pieces
it came with a carrying case and cloth to clean the lens
i can see for miles
cant wait to take these to a sporting event
ill be up close and personal
no gripes just go with it
very pleased with this purchasemy kids are playing with an old toy pair of binoculars
it is missing an eyepiece it is old and abused for years
i decided to look for a more decent pair so they can enjoy more their newly found hobbythe first entry after searching online came out to this little guy
it is only around twelve bucks at the time of this review which is just perfect for its purpose
it also shows hundred of reviews that are positivesit came with a neat black case and a piece of cleaning cloth
some manufacturers make them with cheapo plastics this is made of rugged rubberized construction
it looks like it can withstand some rough handling by my kidsright in the middle sits a ring for  focusing
my eyes needs prescription glasses but it provides wide range of focusing that i dont even need my prescription glasses to see clearly on it
now that is convenient
you can also adjust the distance between the two eyepieces easily so it can adapt to both kids and adults
the only thing missing is a zoom but i often see that feature only on more expensive and bulkier binocularsdont expect a sophisticated lenses at this price
the lenses are basics but capable
they are also small making the images dimmer than those with bigger lensesthe only thing i am disappointed is the width of view or coverage
most of the time when you go to a concert or a game the only thing you will see is the head of the performer
this is worse when you are not sitting very far because sometimes you want to see the whole body the whole group or even part of the stage
well i guess it is pretty much the standard
but it will be great if there are other versions of these binoculars available in other magnification lets say x or  times
in that case i will grab another pair right away specially if they offer them at the same pricethese are a very nice binocular for the money
my only objection was the instructions
it includes instructions in  different languages
the print was so small that i could not read them
they appear to be well madewould love to give this  stars
binos arrived with the common problem of being out of alignment so a few stars lost there
but with the good price i just fixed them myself
the thing that impresses me the most about these is the field of view is one third greater than the new bushnell x binos that i bought at the same time
also the x is about right the x are a bit jittery
very convenient to use just pull out of the pouch no lens caps to deal with
but the wide angle view puzzles me since my other x is literally wide angle binos
hope this helps someonegreat when im sitting out in the bleachers although has have been mentioned by others you have a very steady hand to keep view from bobbingi bought these to use at football games where i sit near the top of the stadium at the university of washington
the magnification works really great
its really small which has its benefits but also drawbacksdue to its size i can easily fit it in my pocket which makes it easier to lug around especially if you already have enough of other things to tote around
however it also means that the amount of area you can see is smaller than if you had bigger lenses
its ok from a magnification standpoint its more about how wide and tall of a picture you want to see at once
because of this i tend to look through it to see something like players up close when they are between plays
for game action i tend not to use it because of the limited width i can see when i need to see large chunks of the field simultaneouslyoverall its a great deal for the pricei bought my first binoculars
these are compact lightweight and easy to use
highly recommendwell made easy to use effective magnification
i would recommend this especially for outdoors use birdwatching hiking
came with protective case folds compactlyi bought them for a concert i was attending they worked pretty good i was impressed that i could still see pretty clear at the distance i was
now i use them for birdwatch at my backyard and i like them a lot
i can see very clearly at the birds
i recommend them just bought these at walmart and use them primarily at the shooting range
i would not hunt w these as generally you need a wider field of view and more light but they are decent for other stuff like target shooting at less than  yards and varmint hunting on your own property
one thing all readers should realize is that in general you get what you pay for w optics
i also have the leupold arcadias x in the  range
i use them when hunting and birdanimal watching
they are simply amazing and worth the pricei purchased these because i dont like taking my  binoculars to football games and rock concerts
these are perfect
the optics are a little cheap but at  i think its a stealgood product for the money 
we recently had the opportunity to go to a nascar race and didnt particularly want to take a set of full size binoculars
in an effort to downsize and lighten our load we purchased these compact binoculars
nice product
very compactwellmade pair of binoculars for a good price
bought them to see the stage from the very last nosebleed row at the theater and they did the job splendidly
may be a little too highpower if youre sitting any closer though as you can only follow one character at a time even from the last row
but otherwise fabulous purchasethese are a nice pair of binoculars lightweight comfortable in your hands but i found them hard to get a clear steady image thrui realize now after the fact that they were not the best choice for my applicationi was looking for a smaller lightweight pair of binoculars for my mother to use for back yard bird watching
these were a little too powerfull for my mother to handle and for her the x magnification meant they were hard to keep steady without a tripod of some sorti utlimately went with the bushnell natureview x binoculars
true its only half the magnification but in this case for what i needed less was much betterthese binoculars are everything i had imagined
i dont know the advanced features on higherend binoculars but these are small and perfect for simple tasks
i can use them without my glasses as they have the main focus and the diopter adjustment in the right eyethey just barely stretch wide enough for my big head so some heads might not fit
i can use them to see the buildings and activity on the opposite side of the bay and they also bring distant wildlife into view
next i need an imagestabilized x zoom camcorder for better viewing and capture of the sights im seeing but thats going to be  times as expensivethis is a very nice quality item and works great
i just wished i had ordered one with more zoom power
is going to make an excellent gift tooit is compact and easy to carry
the string you wear around your neck can get hurt bc it is so thin should make it more bigger and comfortable to wear around neck
bushnell works fine and it just take a little time to get use to when you first use it
but overall i am fine with itthe optics are pretty clear for a low dollar high power compact
they are really small but adjust easily so anyone can use them
they focus easily
the binocular construction seems strong but the case is sloppy and weak
though ive only strapped them on a dozen times the case already has a wear hold near the belt loop
id definitely recommend them even though ill probably end up having to buy another case to hold themgood binocular
even a good item to gift alsobiggest advantage is that you can watch without glassesi bought this so we could get a better look at the birds in our backyard
we keep it by the kitchen window and find ourselves using it at least once a week to peek at a feathered friend who is visiting
nice clear lens pretty easy to find objects through them
certainly does the job we need it to do
dont buy this if you do your birding out in the field  these are not particularly portable nor leightweight and are not meant to be buy a binocular specifically made for that purposeonly complaint and it is minor is that i find the lens caps to be flimsy and a little hard to use
we generally just keep them offthis item is great for the price in fact i was pretty impressed by the lens and the zoompros great zoom amazing clarity and very receptive control
had terrific experience at the everglades national park with thiscons no strap the covers are really flimsythey are good for the price
we use them for watching games wildlife and sometimes stars
i wish the case were a little sturdier howeverim not a pro but this one meets all my needs
a bit heavy to carry around but the wide angle makes it worththis is a great buy much better than my chinese binoculars
the optics are way better than expected
the only con so far is the weight it is heavier than my old one so i have to try to rest it to focus properlyvery impressive performance for the price
they do better than expected in lowlight conditions the lenses dont fog yet
and the carrying case is anadded extra
i might buy another pair for my sonsfor the price these work good the strap is terrible
but the optics are decent
and price is greati amy be spoiled by high quality military grade binos but am dissapointed in the dusk and dawn capability of these binos
granted that is the hardest test but i have no issue hand holding this  power glasses
if truly trying to see small movement i do have to resort to propping or leaning support but find the field of view to be quite good for this priced binosthese binoculars are pretty decent
of course you can not zoom in and see a hair on an elephants bottom but they work well for close to mid range bird watching and seeing what is going on in your neighborhood
lolwe live in a roof top apartment and have a nice view of the city
got these principally to be able to zoom in and see different details in the neighborhood and the citywe are binocular newbies  did not have any difficulties figuring out how to use them and are pleased with the purchase  weve had a lot of fun with these binocularsthis is my first pair of bios i ever ownedwhen it came to me a eye peice was removed and i had to screw it back in but after that it seems to be working finei noticed a bit of the double visioncrossed eyed effect other reviewers talked about but it only seems to happen when im viewing certain distances and cant really seem to nail the focusbut honestly its not that much of a painreasonable quality for the price good starter optics
if such a thing exists
afterall why buy a  dollar set of optics for a teen using these at a sporting event or just rambling around the woods looking for squirrels to shoot
bought these at a discount previously openedfrom amazon warehousedealscom
the manufacturers box they came in had seen better days but the shipping box and packaging was first rate
got them for rougly percent of the retail price and was quite aware of packaging issue prior to purchase
they were dissassembled upon arrivali found that odd so i put them together and really looked them over and they appear flawless
im not a optics expertmost of my optics revolve around the shooting sports and they just have to work as advertised
these do work as advertisedi can focus on a bird at our feeder and then watch it flying all the way to its nest
i just touch the instant focus feature with my finger and do not have to take my eyes off iti purchased this for my daughter who loves watching the different species of birds visiting her feeder
this was replacing a smaller pair of binoculars
only issue is if you are rather close to the object say  there is no way to bring it into focusgood price and quality combinationweve used these things successfully in the past for creating temporary private networks at an annual conference
we wanted dhcp but didnt need wireless
needed another one so went with a familiar product and also to keep similar equipment
we subsequently purchased one more router but  due to timing stock and availability of newer products  we went with a different model wrtnl or e i think
all still worked well
didnt have to use customer support dont know how to rate advertising except that it seemed accurate i have no idea about components and didnt really care since it workedi think its safe to say that  of the people out there could buy this unit plug it in and be up and running instantly with the default configuration
from that respect its a good unit nice interface easy to set up and reasonably reliableif on the other hand youre part of the infamous quotother quot who want to do some hosting forward some ports or run some fancy internetbased applications you should probably move up to a professionalquality router
there are only a limited number of forwarding and triggering commands you can put in which seems to be a limit of the interface not necessarily of the hardware
the product also lacks a number of wouldbeuseful features such as blocking out hostile ip addresses forwarding ports based on host header remote access from outside of your local network and any kind of reportingstatus indicators that would assure you the firewall is in fact even workingthis product worked great for most things but i couldnt send attachments with my emails when using a particular smtp server
changing smtp server or computer i was sending from or email program all fixed the problem but that wasnt good enough
i returned the linksys and got the netgear websafe router which didnt have this problem
also one time it locked up completely and i had to pull the plug
other than that i liked the product quite a lot  it was trivial to set up and the web interface was nice to use
also ive got friends who have no problems with it so it must have been something about my setup which triggered some obscure bugsetup was a breeze
less than min out of the box and i had three computers sharing my cable modem
the manual goes over the basics for a beginner but if you are planning on setting something a little more complicated youll have to look up some info onlinethere are problems running certain types of game servers you gotta check game manufacturers website or check in some game forumsthere is also a known issue with quake  where you may lose your connection to the router and have to reboot
flashing to an older firmware is the suggested fix until linksys figures it outother than those minor issues i would definitely recommend this productinstalling this product wasnt as smooth as i would have liked
first of all i have a dsl connection that requires pppoe to connect
my provider gave me the software to do this
however the router takes care of this for you and you therefore must remove any pppoe applications off your computer as this will cause you not to be able to surf the web
even though i did this there was still lingering software that kept popping up a dial up networking connection whenever i tried to enter a url
i then learned how bad linksys customer service ison average my wait was about  minutes and i generally got technicians who were more interested in getting you off the line than helping you
sometimes you get an operator who takes down your name and number promising that someone will get back to you
hah
they never did with me
i admit that the problem was not their fault and knowledge in tcpip still wouldnt have helped knowledge that i do have
however do realize that it took me about  days worth of  minute per call phone calls to get my first pc up and running
i didnt have the same problem on any of my other computers including my linux boxalso the current software that i have i bought the router about   months ago has three small bugs in it
first once i make a connection to my dsl modem the status page continually refreshes letting me know the status
however once connected the status always says quotconnectedquot even if i know that im not like if i unplug the phone line
secondly the router doesnt save the password even though i check the checkbox saying that it should
so i have to therefore enter the password every time that i go to the admin page
thirdly the box rarely gives accurate user info
for example four computers may be connected
however when one checks they may see only one two or three people connected
i only have four computers connected right now
however the incorrect info would definitely cause problems in a soho
however these bugs may have been fixed and i may simply need to download the latest router os sooverall great product
ive had computers collecting dust simply because it was impossible to share all of the resources before
ive downloaded a file on separate computers at an average rate of kbsec on each computer
obviously this will be affected with more users
however great product overalli set up a linksys port router and i am extremely pleased
it is fast fast fast
however i too have dsl from a provider that supports pppoe and let me tell you it pays to have friends who know network architecture
i am a programmer but a mere developer is no match for this baby
i worked with linksys online support and the tech told me the router was defective and to send it back to amazon
i didnt believe him and my tech friend didnt either
ten minutes on the phone and we had it up and running set to fixed ip addresses for my pcs not dhcp
once its up and running it is a brave new world
i would rate it  stars if mere mortals could install itfirst off i have to admit that im an intermediate at best user
far from a newbie i started back in the predos days with a kaypro
but i have been left in the dust in recent yearsi have been using an older version of this same model router for  years and found it incapable of handling my isps hispeeds
i was clocking only up to about  mbps download my isp supposed to deliver up to  mbpsthe good news is that once i managed to get this new version up and running about  hours and  phone calls it was fantastic
im getting  mbps over most test serversthe bad news is that it wasnt as simple to install it as id hoped
first i connected everything exactly as the wizard instructed
when it came to configure my router it said it could not detect a router
i tried again
it said it could not configure the router
i tried again and again
i called my isp to make sure the internet type etc was correctthen i called linksys and got their call center in the phillipines
the first customer service person i called was very friendly but told me id need to connect directly to the modem so i could configure the router manually
since i was having a bit of trouble doing that i got a case number and told her id call tech support backi managed to get online by bypassing the router altogether and called linksys back
i got a guy whose accent was so thick i had trouble understanding him
he was rude and impatient
he told me the advice the first person gave was wrong  that i had to be connected to the router in order to manually change its settings which is i have to admit the correct infowhen i had a little delay in reconnecting the cables with him waiting impatiently on the line he asked me how many cables i had
i told him i had a cable from the computer to the router and one from the router to the modem
he asked again with clear impatience in his voice how many cables i had
i repeated my answer
then he said it would be best is they did a remote hookup to make the changes to my computer
i do not feel comfortable with that but reluctantly agreed
then he told me theyd be an extra charge for the servicei said no that i needed him to help me install the router
well im not saying he hung up on me but the line went dead at that point
coincidence
perhapsanyway i kept fiddling around using different cables not the one that came with the router and giving my cable modem time to reset itself that may have been the key i dont knowsuddenly everything was working
im so happy with the performance that im like a new mother who immediately forgets the pain of childbirth
i have a healthy  mbps connection and can easily dismiss the labor painsso bottom line is that the router itself is excellent but the documentation and customer service stinki wanted a basic solid wired unit
this wireless craze is nothing but problem  and too much radiation anyway
its plug and play no software required unless you need the security of a password
dont need it with a wired family network
thats one less quirk to worry aboutbought a wireless netgear for less money before this and could not get pass word software to work on that either and could not turn off wireless featureotherwise this works fine and fast so im leaving well enough alone
had to reset turn it off and on again once in two weeks because i tried to back out of a secure socket situation
dont know if it was this router that was at fault
but resetting the router fixed iti bought the router for my roadrunner cable modem
the critical piece of advice was missing however which would otherwise have meant only a  minute setup job
when connecting as instructed in the manual you also  have to call mediaoneroadrunner to give them the router mac address
unfortunately they asked for the lan mac address of the router which is  the wrong card
you should give the wan wide area mac number to the tech  people who will add this to your list of mac addresses
this is at no  cost
both mac addresses are visible on the setup screen of the router
once the correct wans mac address was added to my account and the modem  is powered down and rebooted it worked like a charmthis unit works well
it took me quite a while to set it up on a macintosh and included a lot of guessing since the instructions are not at all mac friendly
once up and running however it works like a charm
mac instructions would have been helpful
in a nation thats obsessed with diversity there seems scant attention paid to diversity in computingthanks to this my  pcs share the same fast dsl access and i also can access any computer on my network from any other computer
i had a little problem setting it up with my isp but linksyss technical support was more than helpful on getting everything working
i have not have any not one problem with this router since
i even had to wipe out my hard drives because one of my computer frequently crashes another problem and everytime i reload the os and peripherals on it the router automatcially reconizes it and it is immediately able to connect to the internet without any more configuration changes to the router
i love the routers setup screen it is very informative and user friendly
i just type the routers ip address in ie or netscape and the setup screen comes up
it even allows you to password protect this setup screen to prevent unauthorized accessin addition to this i am able to share my printer over the network and i just recently got a laptop computer from my employer to use at work and home
the first time i took the computer home all i basically had to do was hook up the laptop to the router make some configuration changes on my laptop not the router and voila my laptop computer was sharing the dsl internet access
it also shares printer and can also access my home computers hard drives which makes my work alot easier  i hope they keep up the good work
i may be upgrading to linksys wireless dsl router in the future but for now this serves my needs effectivelyive been running the befsr for about a year and for the most part its worked flawlessly
however the dhcp server appears faulty
occasionally i get an ip conflict when a new computer logs in
in addition when looking at the computers that have dhcpassigned ip addresses through the administration access the reporting is almost completely erratic
for example almost never are all the computers shown and refreshing the screen has no effect
linksys tech support has verified this is not working properly but has no solution
ppoe to log into sbcs dsl works great and port forwarding is also passable though you have to assign a static ip to the devive you want to route to rather than the mac address or device name which is a bit of a pain
overall for the price it works pretty wellhello alli purchased this unit as part of my multilayer approach to computer security
while there are many other brands that i could have purchased the fact that  of routers that my clients are using are linksys models this alone speaks volumes
the setup of the unit was painless and in less than  minutes i had the unit configured and working flawlessly
i would not hesitate to purchase this unit again nor would i hesitate to recommend it to anyone needing a unit like itciaono problems out of the box
will do what you purchased it to do
but we are talking about a  router and the technology has advanced since then
nice inexpensive alternative but if you are looking for better performance and more features time to move onpurchased this exact router on october   from amazon
it is still in my order history and used the link from that order to write my reviewi had it open and up and running and all my computers going on my mb dsl speed and was so happy
okay it is easy to set up butthen came the problem
i run several msn groups and suddenly i could not post messages
okay i concede maybe not everyone expects to post at msn groups butthen whoa nelly  i went to microsoft windows update window and i could not access it
it could not scan my computer
now wait a bloody minute
not being able to post in the msn groups is one thing not being able to update your computer with microsoft patches is suicide
i mean nearly everyone needs to access microsoft update window to keep their computer safe from all the wholes in xp
this is bad oversiteso i emailed them
i got a quick response that i had to go and set up port forwarding yadayadaexcuse mesuddenly the easy set up was no so easy as promisedyes it is very good yes it gives four computers mb speed at one and i am so thrilled
however this big oversite of not being able to access microsoft is ridiculous
yes it can been fixed by changing the ports for forward microsoft traffic  but the point is why should they
one of the most basic things we need to access windows update and you cannot unless you make changesthose changes should have been done before the first one of this was shippingshame on them for making customers work shame on them for not being as easy as they promised and shame on them for ignoring nearly everyone will have to go through this and not give any warning
four stars for the product four stars for their promt response  one star for their stupid plans on not including something every computer would need to access
if your computers are newer you will likely want to go wireless insteadordered this item  received the version  model fyi
ended up having to call tech support to get it working because its default ip address is the same of verizons dsl modems
tech support took a total of  minutes of dealing with multiple people and trying redundant tests to get it resolved
ive gone through  of these in the past  years they dont seem to have a long lifespan
still theyre the best of a sorry loti couldnt be happier with this product
it has lived up to all of the good reviews and then somefor me it was literally a drop in replacement for a hub
i unplugged this hub plugged in the linksys router and everything worked
it doesnt get easier than thatof course most people are going to want to configure the router a bit
no problem the web interface makes it simple
just open up your browser and point it at the routers ip address
you are presented with a set of web pages that allow you to configure all of the routers settings
if you need to run a server or two it takes no time to open ports through the web interfaceon the downside there are some inconsistencies between the routers documentation and the linksys website documentation
for example one set of documentation says that dhcp must be disabled if you are going to use port forwarding
another says the opposite
as it turns out dhcp works fine with port forwardingoverall this router is a great addition to your home network
it will allow you to share a single broadband connection without purchasing additional ip addresses and provide enhanced security through its firewall featuresive had no problems at all with my router for about  months so far
i get slick speeds and ive been able to connect a pc a mac g and a laser printer
i plan to add another pc soonmy internet provider tried to get me to buy a hub and another ip address for an additional  a month
i originally thought they could get away with this because the service checked the hardware code on my ethernet card
that was my biggest stumbling block  once i realized i could clone my ethernet hardware code on the router basically change the identifying code of the router to match the ethernet card everything was perfectid give it  stars but these initial difficulties indicate that it would be helpful to have a technerd around to get it started if necessaryi am a systems architect for web based companies
we use the bigboy products like cisco pix firewalls at a cost of  per network segement we are protecting
the level of protection and functionality you get out of this device is amazing at the price
i have also used the comparable netgear router and found it to be pretty much equivalent
i have also built similar firewalls using linux and an old pc  a process that usually takes a day or two of your free time if you know what youre doing
the  or so that these devices cost is cheap for two days of my personal timethis is a solid product for a great price
you dont need the accompanying cdrom to set it up
in my case i hooked it up to a toshiba cable modem and followed the quick start guide to configure the settings
it didnt work right away
a quick call to my cable modem provider revealed that i needed to turn the cable modem off and back on so it can quottoleratequot the routerso when you set this up for the first time be sure to restart both the router and the cable modem after you configure itfirst of all this router works great
i now have all my computers connected to my dsl connection
i no longer have to disconnect one cable to install it into a different computer for internet access
it was easy to wire my computers to this router
i have not noticed any decrease in speed on my internet connectionthe problem was setting up the routers firmware
my best guess is that linksys expects you to connect this router to a cable company modem instead of a dsl modem
in order to connect to a dsl modem you must change the routers address from  to   be sure your dsl modem is not connected to the router when you do thisi could not find this information on the cd that came with the router
i had to go to the linksys website for this informationoverall i do recommend this routerive had my linksys router now for over  years
while the this one is clearly a newer version mine only has a mbps wan throughput the overall quality has not changed as i have sat down to tinker with the newer versionswhat impresses me about this model of linksys router is how user friendly it is
the router design is simple with easy to read information readouts via led lights and the device is light weight with ample room underneath for ventilationsetup is virtually plug n play
i tend to follow this hookup for ideal connections avoids random drops and dchp problems locally
connect everything as instructed to the router but make sure all devices are off
with all devices off
turn on the cable mode  dsl modem and let it connect
turn on your linksys router it should turn on and then detect a network aka the activity light is being well active
turn your devices onthis lets the router fully handshake with your isp and also allows it to hand out local ips while within the isps network
is it crucial
not at all but it does make for a more solid handshake which can reduce the chance of being dropped  resetting the routerthe interface for the router is very simplistic compared to other brands
while some options can be fairly advanced for the most part the router comes presetup for a good experience and it is advised to put a password in the router to avoid people remotely accessing it wo your permissionin my  years using the linksys router i have yet to experience a random reset lost connection or the router failing to handshake with my isp
it has been incredibly reliable
there has been no packet loss due to the router having communication problems multiple devices demanding information at once a bad router would get screwed up and start sending data to the wrong places  this router also works for all games ive played including wow lotro age of conan aion etc  without having to open any ports my old netgear router constantly required me to open ports the only negative i can say about this router is that it is fairly sensitive to voltage change on a line
for example i plug a vacuum cleaner into the outlet in my bathroom to do some cleaning in the hallway
the bathroom outlet and my pc room are linked  when i turn the vacuum on  in  times the router will drop and go to standby red light on activity because it acted as if it had lost power for a moment
my netgear didnt have this problem but that said my netgear router lasted me  months before burning itself up
this has gone for over  years
 i am mentioning this because sometimes people complain a router drops a lot and resets itself
this isnt always the routers fault as it could be that it is sensitive to voltage fluctuations which can be a good thing as it does protect the device to a pointanyhow
overall i have been very pleased with this router
my cousins actually use the wireless version of this router and for the past  years they have been problem free w no drops
linksys makes quality routers at a good price
i have never had to deal with their customer service so i cant comment on the company as a whole but their routers are top notch in my bookout of the box its ready to go
it acts as a network switch better than a hub a broadband highspeed network router and a firewall
although linksys offers no macspecific support it works with macs even with an airport hooked into itlinksys has released several firmware upgrades which can be easily uploaded to the befsr
a tftp program is included in the firmware update package but its only for pcs no surprise there based on my previous comment
mac users will need to download mactftp a shareware implementation of a tftp client
search on versiontrackercom for the latest versionmacs and pcs can share the same internet connectionthe befsr also acts as a dhcp server so you dont need to preassign ip addresses to the macs and pcs in your networkthe firewall prevents others on the internet from snooping into your network an important consideration if you have a highspeed internet connection that is constantly onlinechanging the settings is easy and can be accomplished through a web browser on either a pc or mac
simply use the ip address of the router as the url
it will prompt you for a userid and password
leave the userid blank and enter just the password
if you havent changed the password yourself the original password can be found by reading the owners manual
unless you have some very specific network requirements the outofthebox configuration will work very well for most peoplemake sure you write down any settings you change
when you upgrade the firmware all settings are reset to factory defaultsthe best features extremely easy to set up and it worksit does deliver
its very cheap and installation was as easy as     i had never connected a network before and this took me seriously about  minutesthat was all
now my family is able to get online with both my pcs at the same time share my printer share the cdrom as well as music  files between both of the computers
i am also able now to enjoy multiplayer games in a different level  with my own family in my own homethe routher is very easy to configure and you just need to know the basics
it does have a bunch of features like port forwarding dynamic routing static routing dmz host dhcp and also supports pppoe connectionsi have not noticed a decreased in speed  i am still connected at a solid  mbpsfor the beginner for the one who doesnt need the extra bells  wistles id highly recommend it
its virtually fool proof and it keeps your network hidden from internet attacksever since i installed the router my norton internet security has not warned me about any intrusion attemps or any port searches or trojansone thing that i would have liked better is that if it had come with a better manual  it only comes with a setup guide thats very light on content but still usefulyou can however get the manual online using adobe readeranother thingto make vpn work is a pain
i have still not been able to make a vpn connection work and ive seen many many users having the same problem
the linksys website is not very clear on how to set it up
i know the right ports to open but its still impossible to do
thats one thing you might want to consider if you plan to do vpn connections
other than that port forwarding dmz and other features work fine for mevery nicely done by linksys
would have gotten  stars if the vpn was easier to set up and configure
definitely gets  starsi have had this router so long i cannot remember if a review was written
about the time of  this router was purchased
wireless then was out of the questionthis thing keeps going and going
the only problem was a dead port
i have since daisy chained the router to a linksys wrtg wireless and it is still running flawlesslyhaving a mac with os x i was careful prior to purchasing the befsr
i called linksys tech support and was assured that it was compatible
contrary to at least one review of this product this router does work with macintosh
i purchased it and hooked it up without incident in less than  minutes to a second pc made the required connection via internet explorer to linksys server and entered the required values
the instructions are easy to follow and adequately illustrated
after restarting both computers i anticipated continued success
unfortunately my computers could not establish a link with my provider
since i had previous success prior to purchasing with their tech support i called and was efficiently walked through some additional tweeking via internet explorer to the linksys server
i was up and running with a minimal amount of hassle
one star taken away for not working immediately out of the boxi needed something to share the dsl connection between two computers in separate rooms
i already had holes in the walls for a network connection with a crossover cable and had network cards installed so i didnt need a wireless router and receivers
i decided on getting this one due to being familiar with the companys cable modemsetting up the computers with the router was simple with the help of the cd installation program
the router automatically treated the crossover cable as a regular ethernet cable which saved me another trip to the store
updating the firmware was also easy to do and no problems came out of thata few weeks later the linksys router kept resetting itself every  minutes every time i had torrent connections going
through some online searching i found out that my dsl modem had a builtin router as well and there was some conflict with the linksys router
after switching off most of the autodetect options and manually entering in most of the connection settings on both the dsl modem and linksys router the router was rocksolid againas long as the firmware is up to date and there are no conflicts between the modem and router it should work without problemsother reviewers have pointed out that these routers tend to die after some time
if youre getting a linksys router you may want to consider doing what i did
noting the frailty of the unit i bought the three year warranty where the store will replace the unit if it breaks no questions asked
even with the extra warranty the unit was inexpensive and if it breaks the store probably has more clout with linksys than i do
the four star rating is due to the units easy setupworks well and easy set up
just a little confusing when it comes to the isp pasword and username  i cant find it and my nat type is not open any more so im having to have someone come over to fix it for me
other than that things work wellthis cabledsl router offers everything you need to share your  internet connection and protect your home lan
the product offers many of the same features as belkin or dlink in regards to dhcp pppoe etc
the beauty is that if these acronyms mean nothing to you no problem
the router has a overall good manual with a browser interface that makes setup and configuration easy
the manual uses many screenshots that help when looking for the appropriate setting and offer some explanation to the features
all of the basic features are set to work with almost any cabledsl setup and if you need more configuration the options are usually therethe only problem i have found is that the firmware updates are needed for better control and functionality but the java based website can be problematic
they require you modify you security settings for java in ie which can be daunting for some and also do not always work
i was able to manually install but the browser interface would be easier for the novice
other than that this is a good router on par with the majority of other big name home routers on the marketive always had good luck with linksys routers
so i picked up this one to replace my yr old linksys that went out on me
so far this one works with no issuesi had previously written reviews in earlymid july for this product
at that time i was impressed with the product but was having problems may or may not have been related to my use of dsl andor pppoe with my ispi have since upgraded to v of the firmware and am happy to report that i am no longer experiencing problems
my linux machine automatically pings an ip address every five minutes  this is logged and i am no longer seeing outagesso overall i give the product  out of  stars
its a great product but unfortunately i feel linksys should have testeddiscovered the pppoe problems in advance
the documentation for the product could also be enhancedimprovedpeterthe only reason im only giving this  stars is because ive already burned out my second linksys router in so many months
its a bit frustrating on the pocketbook
its not linksys fault  living in florida the lightning capital of the world really has much to blame for my current linksys router problemsprimarily though i am very pleased with this router
straight and to the point  it works very well
and the setup is quite easy
i got it up and running within minutes linking  pcs and  game system to our cable modem without needing directions
and they all had no problems accessing the internet
i didnt even need to tweak the settings for the game system as i had to do before with the previous linksys i hadmy first linksys lasted two years
reviews of that particular model revealed a consistent  year working life
i was concerned about that when i purchased this model but figured that even if i got only two years out of it i got my moneys worth
unfortunately this one barely lasted a year so im a bit disappointed
however like i stated before it wasnt due to the router itself
we had a severe lightning storm and it did some damage to several items in my home the router lan card printer port the phone line and half of the alarm system
im fortunate that it was limited to just that
i may have avoided the problem altogether had i used a surge protectorive purchased another brand router for now with slightly different features
however i wont hesistate to go back to linksys if need be if this different brand model turns out to be a dudwhen you get through the technical side of setting this product up youll find that adding and removing devices usually pcs to the network is a sinchi use this product to split off my internet access to  pcs in my house
i had some slight setup problems when i began but calling techsupport and having them help me was a breezenow i simply plug my modem cable wire into the wide area network wan port and my computers cable wires into the pc slots and the entire network is off and runningsimply add some of the network adapters software that allows devices to communicate between themselves and youre off and venturing into some extraordinary territoryyou can play games online without crashing a hublike symptom which is nonexisten here and you can do other things like share internet connection share files and share a printer among many usersgood for small business use ore home usethe price of one month of internet access will buy you unlimited connections in one housealthough you can now buy the wireless version of the same product it can get costly
so watch out
it may be suffice to get this one for the price also remember that if you buy the wireless product that you will not only pay more for it but youll be required to buy more expensive network cards wireless ones that will interface with your routerthe wireless one is generally  twice as expensive as are the network cardsnote network cards are the devices you need to have in your computer that allows you to plug into the router
it is the thing the cable wire plugs into in the back of your computer
suffice to say if you are using cable now for internet access youll be fine to buy and set this upibought this router for my wireless setup at home
it turned out to be a fairly good product
why four stars
the setup through my cable home was a nightmare
lot of different things to change and configure
too many to name i consider myself very computer literate in softwarehardware and this was a nightmarethat being said the support at linksys was very good
very easy to work with and friendlynow that my system is up and running with wireless support it was all worth the hassel
but the setup is not for the faint of heart
may be better off getting the wireless adapter with the router built inabout  minutes after i opened the box containing my linksys ethernet router i had it connected and set up without reading any instructions the unit is clearly marked and youve really got to go out of your way to screw upthe instructions tell you what ip address to log into via your browser to get a snazzy looking login screen and administration pages
linksys is known for its reliability and ease of use and i got recommendations from other users of this productmy less than perfect rating for this item is their total lack of acknowledgement of the mac platform it is to their own detriment
i have this set up with my mac g agp but mostly due to the ease of use of the mac platformthis router comes with documentation for every flavor of windows except  but does not give any instructions for mac os not one word
its hard to believe a manufacturer would have a potential audience of about  million mac owners and not exploit the fact that their product works seamlessly w the mac platformeven their website remains silent on the mac os which did leave me having some guesswork and figuring out stuff on my own as well as consulting macfixit forums etc
the enclosed cd has additional instructions but you guessed it nothing regarding the mac
for shamethe leds are pretty straight forward and its easy to see at a glance which port is having activity
the unit is designed so that additional routers can stack and fit in an interlocking fashion so that the legs of the unit above fit in indentations of the case below
the legs have rubberized feet pads to prevent scratching of nice desksif you have broadband connectivity you owe it to yourself to get a router such as this one to protect you from hackers
the linksys etherfast router is known for having a dependable hardware firewall
even if youre a mac user you cant do better for the price than this unit you just may need to do some searches on the internet for instructions by other mac users to ease your comfort levelthis is my nd of these routers in the past  years
my first one was working fine until i decided to go through the firmware upgrade process
following the directions laid out by linksys the firmware update ended up making my router unusable
i called tech support and after waiting forever the tech basically told me it was unfixable and id have to go buy another one
he never really asked me too many questions and just seemed interested in getting me off the phone and in the store to buy another one
i ended up having that first one for  yearsso i go purchase another one and have been using it for going on  years roughly
it works great easy to setup and gives me lots of home network expandabilityim not a computer guru so i cant comment on its technical aspects but ive never had any problems that were interent home network or virus related with this productsetup instructions are easy to follow
if you are really a beginning level computer user it may be difficult
if you have some computer hardware experience things work like a breeze
i have it hooked up with two win computer and one win  computer using athome cable modem service
it works flawlessly most of the timemy only compliant is that the power source makes a high pitched squeeling noise after being in use for extended periods
you need to unplug it to get rid of the high pitched noisethe internet cable service told me that i would need to purchase extra ip addresses
this thing will work without them
isnt that the point of using the router
dont listen to them if they tell you to pay extra money for extra computers hooked up to the modem
the router does the job for youthis router works great for the two computers that we need wired for our house
for some reason ive had trouble connecting more than  uses to the router thoughbut the third and fourth arent needed
good router
good pricealthough linksys does not officially support the macintosh this router is easily configured via a your web browser so it can be configured fine on a macintoshthe unit works well with no problems
in fact using dhcp you dont really have to do much configuring at all
just plug it between your computer and your cable or dsl modem
their  tech support is a plus
the firewall provides added security against people hacking into your machine
the unit also has  ports so you can share your high speed internet access with other computers
or if a friend comes over with a laptop he can jack into the net at high speeds as welli would recommend this unit due to the price and the linksys tech support
you should pay under money for thisthere are other routers out there that do the same thing so price and functionality are really the only factors to considerthis router performed as promised
following the cd to install it is essential and easy to do
but there is no manual no quickstart guide and no troubleshooter that comes with it
all of those things are on the cd limited as that is
and to make personal settings refine it or troubleshoot it you have to go online and do research
the internal settings can be very complicated
im attempting to use it for my tivo to transfer recordings from my tivo to my pc
it is taking almost more work than is worth the effort
the router itself works exactly as it should
since there is no manual and findind linksys tech support is very difficult id suggest finding a good tech support place online read it and see if you want to delve into all that this type of connection may require
all in all i may go back to not using a router at allthis would be the perfect router if it included spi firewall capabilities but it does serve its purpose
i have mine connected to a motorola sb surfboard cable modem with cox as my isp
the combination of the  allows me up to mbps downloads which is flying
setup was pretty easy just follow the instructions and your surfing the internet
the network address translator nat is pretty cool but you need to do some additional tweaking for a more secure connection
i went to dslreportscom to have my ip address probed
it told me that udp ports  and udp ports  were open and that it could be a possible threat
so i logged on as the administrator and filtered udp ports  and  had my ip address reprobed and passed the port scan report with flying colors
basically it said that my ip address did not show any threats for my default tcp and udp ports
i also have the internet connection firewall enabled in windows xp and have zone alarm installed on my computer
so i feel pretty secure surfing the internet but i also realize if a really good hacker really wants to get into my system he or she willoverall this is a great little router
i will however upgrade to a firewall router with stateful packet inspection capabilities in the future
not quite  stars but closethe linksys hpn uses a newer protocol of a technology that has beenaround since at least  called data over voice or dov
only a coupleof manufacturers made these products and black box might still carry itin their private label versionthere never was a bridge to broadband until now
it was and still is away to create a network using twistedpair wiring between computers toshare files and resources like printers modems etc
you can be on thephone and access the modem on another pc connected to a different phoneline giving you access to your desktop while talking
that was a typicalapplication with  machines before windowsfor best results use cat installed in newer houses like mine or evengo to twisted pair network cable like belden  you might exceed mbper second if you maintain the shielding right to the hpn bracket byattaching the drain wire to it with a screw or screwing the bracket inthe case slot holder with the drain wire
the rjc jack side must havea ground connection for the drain wire on the phone jack
using a surgeprotector with telco protection can provide a good grounding point alsoand is recommended as you will be connected to the pstn even though notusing its facilities like dialupsmall office  machines linked on one phone line which is also fax line  wins  win
hardest to set up with win
for some reason driver did not seem to want to load
i had to completely uninstall network components and reinstall then install driver manually
worked after that
think it was a comflict with a bios setting but never confirmed itok my company has three gateway astros and they have only usb connectivity
i had not choice but to purchase these
first i have noticed that most usb nics only support mbps connections which was a problem for our network infrastructure
the other problem was that most of them were not windows  compatabile no the com is not compatible
this one is  and is windows  compatible
however they are not ideal
the usb bus only support mbps output so you are limited to this even on a mbps connection which is why i am tell you
if you can go another way you should
the do work well though i recomend themi bought these because they were in the list of adapters supported by the old tivos and they worked greati needed a powered hub to make this usb product work on a sony vaio laptop
i was connected via a long  foot ethernet cable to my linksys router and there evidently was not enough signal to drive it
i simply added a powered hub into which i connected the laptop and then it all worked
this usbadapter is still a better soultion than using the one pc card slot which was needed by my cdrom drive
when installing i initially failed to insert the included floppy disk with the winxp driver and i had to reinstall and remove the device a number of times before it workedi used an older manual data transfer switch and began noticing ghosts on my monitor
after purchasing all new cables which didnt solve the problem i figured it was the switch
sure enough this fixed my ghosting problem i was having immediatelythis is an easy to set up thing and i love the ability to switch between systems with the keyboard
however like the other fellow stated in here the plugs are male vga
most of us probably are converting from older equipment which had female at and vga plugs
this has female ps and male vga plugs as well as female ps mouse plugs
youd save half of that if you only have to convert the vga plugs
however one important note the plug that goes to your main monitor is a standard female vga plug so you dont need an adapter for thatwhen assembled especially with the gender changers the thing takes up a huge amount of space because the plugs are mounted on the side
if you plan on switching manually it will take a serious effort to keep all the cords hidden
but rest assured the keyboard switching method works just as well as the manual one
simply hit and release one at a time the alt ctrl shift computer number and enter
switches over like magic
so you can easily hide the whole thing behind your desk now which is probably better anywaythere is even a lastnext mode but that doesnt make a lot of sense since the keyboard is locked until you get out of that modeat any rate if youre using an older switch and notice ghosts appearing on your screen windows which have their white or brighter areas showing shadows of nearby window objects this will fix your problem but be prepared to spend a bit on gender changers
you may want to go ahead and just switch the entire cables out for new ones but that could be a lengthy process depending on your setup but only a bit more expensive than all the gender changers youd needswitching between windows xp and redhat linux and it works well and is easy via a buttong on the unit or by double ctrl clicks
i also use a quot flat panet lcd monitor and the video quality is very good
the only thing i dont like about the unit is that the cables for the  pcs are on the sides of the unit
if it were a bit bigger and all the connectors on the rear i would have rated  starsi did a lot of research on point and shoots looking at and reading about several dozen models before finally settling on a fuji tiara model  which is a great little camera
however in the process of doing all this i hung out in several photography threads and found several comments about the original elph that ultimately decided me against it
several people remarked that the camera developed mechanical problems after only about a year just after the warranty ran out and which were very expensive to fix
then i happened to talk to a friend and it turned out she had purchased an elph that had had similar problems but they had happened early enough so they could return it
anyway notwithstanding these problems the canon elph is probably the aps camera that saved the aps format
no doubt these issues have been fixed in the elph  so if someone really wanted to purchase one its probably okay to do so at this pointi have  of the elph models and i must say i think theyre the best aps cameras available
they are incredibly compact very sturdily built and take wonderful pictures
the elph  has a smooth  zoom and a muchimproved flash unit over the original elph 
while i prefer my elph lt whichever elph you choose will make you happy for years to comeits not the memory that is bad but i bought two memory sandisk  mg memory cards for my rio  and you just cant carry them and choose which one you want to listen to without big time hassles
the rio  is so reluctant to recognize the external memory you have to keep putting it in and taking it out ad nauseum before it finally decides to recognize it
so i dont even do it
i just get the one in there working and erase that and fill it when i want to change music
smartmedia cards are real flimsy not like compact flash memory and seem much more fragile
if i was going to choose what kind of flash memory to have in a camera or mp player id go with compact flash or mm flash memory they are more robust and not so fragilethe first card i bought was doa
the second for a diamond rio works fine  everytime
of note the formatting for a diamond rio is different from that  for anything else so even sandisks usb etc readers cannot decipher data  on a card that has been in a rio
for that you must use the rioport  software or erase and reformat the card in the device in which you would  like to use itnote to first reviewer  these headphones sound much better and go much louder when hooked up to a headphone amplifier their primary intent was not to be run out of a regular headphone jack on a cd player or boom box
the hds or s would sound a bit better and a lot louder on your boom  box another good choice would be the grado sr for youi have owned  my pair of hds for about  months now and i have been very pleased  with them
while not perfect they sound much better then what you find in  most storesthese headphones are not bright at all but rather warm and  have a very laid back sound
they also tend to exagerate bass somewhat  which leads to a slightly boomy sound which i do not care for very much
people who like loud bass read that last sentence as  these headphones do  produce a lot of loud deep bass particularly when asked to do so  those  sound qualities make them good for electronic music as they do not sound  edgy or harsh and bass is plentiful
they are not fatiguing to listen to  at all in part due to the laid back sound
i have had them on for  hours  straightthey also have excellent sound qualities for computer games too
explosions have force and imaging is very good too so you will hear  everything from where it is supposed to be coming fromthat said these  are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn
if you are more the  audiophile vareity i would personally reccomend the sennheiser hds or  the s they have a much more neutral sound that colors the music a lot  less
they also absoluely require an amplifier to get decent sound out of  themthese headphones are good if your intentions are correct
sennheiser calls them the  symphony
they are specificially engineered for symphony music and it is clear in the audio
if you want to listen to your mps buying these headphones may be a bit overboard
if you listen to vocaloriented music like opera or live recordings the sssss will make you cringe
the midrange feels very wierd
they do make classical sound goodthey also have absolutely amazing clarity
while the frequency responce is a bit ackward if details of the sound is what you are looking for then these are what you are looking for
the duofol technology of which i was skeptical at first is amazing
the sound is crisp and clear
there is no moaning and droaning from these headphones
the sound is very very detailed
these would be great for people listening through sound for small quiet details or for sample editing when wavematching is needed
the detail provided is beautiful for that
so know what the headphones are designed for before you punch  into them
they help me so i like them but i can see that there may be some problems for some peoplei bought these as a christmas present for someone after owning the sennheiser hd and hd for years both of legendary sound quality
i abd these with several other headphones in this price range including the bose triport and given enough power these sounded the best although of course they are not as good as the hd and hd which have a more balanced sonic spectrum
the balance seems to be in the favor of the bass end but not the really low bass instead somewhere in the  hz range
it isnt annoying however and after a while your ears just get used to it and they really are a pleasure to listen to having the same open and airy sound of the hd and the hd
for the money i think they are an excellent value provided you already own a headphone amplifierthis latter point brings up the main issue i have with these headphones
frankly i am puzzled by the claims of some reviewers that these headphones can be fully appreciated without a headphone amplifier
i thought my hds were inefficient
but these hds are by far the most inefficient headphones i have ever sampled and require far more power than any portable cd player is capable of delivering that ive ever used
even my two console cd players no slouches either a harman kardon  and a philips cdc  have to be turned up all the way for full concert volume and when that happens the bass just falls apart and swamps the high end in mud as obviously the tiny amplifiers in these cd players are being overmodulated
this could explain the reports in various reviews below that these headphones have a muddy sound
however plugging these into my musical fidelity xcans headphone amplifier a revelation takes place the base firms up the midrange becomes silky smooth and the treble bursts to life
suddenly the hds become very musical and a pleasure to listen to for long periods of timeit seems a little weird to manufacture headphones in a midprice range that require an expensive headphone amplifier to produce excellent sound
anyone going to the lengths of purchasing a headphone amplifier is going to be looking at premium headphone performance and because the frequency response rises in the bass area these dont quite reach those airy heights
however to break them in i listened to them for eight solid hours through my headphone amp
the fact that this was not fatiguing in the least speaks to their very smooth distortionfree sound as well as the sheer physical comfort of the phones themselves enveloping my tender ears all these hoursin summary i would not give the hds as a christmas present to anyone who intends to listen to music directly plugged into a cd player
so what am i recommending these for
well these are a present for my  year old motherinlaw who likes to blast one of our tvs to high heaven when she visits us two or three times a year for a couple months duration each visit
this constant racket emanating from the tv is extremely annoying to the rest of the household
so my presents to her are these headphones and a nice new panasonic flatscreen  tv which stays on the premises with a headphone jack on the front
now she can blast herself into oblivion for all i carei tested these headphones both on the tv i bought for her and on a  toshiba with a front headphone jack
surprisingly both tvs had enough umph to drive these highly inefficient headphones to far beyond tolerable listening levels just like my musical fidelity headphone amp is capable of doing
so thats what id recommend these headphones for which is a rather limited market i would thinkwhat also makes these phones ideal for the hardofhearing television viewer is that they are extremely lightweight and so comfortable that after a while you dont even notice that youre wearing them ideal for the  year old halfdeaf motherinlaw glued to the tube
they also have a  foot cord which makes them ideal for watching a  tvspeaking of the cord i would be wary of the robustness of this cord
at one time sennheiser was notorious for having a fragile cord that easily became shorted out when repeatedly tugged upon at the connection
this problem has been solved for the hd and the hd but im not so sure it has been solved for the hd
the sample in the store was partially shorted out and to hear stereo you had to push laterally on the connector near the phones
obviously this connector did not withstand the rough and tumble of a store demo so to be on the safe side treat the connection gentlymy new s just arrived and even not burned in  but they are quite something you will hear details and weaknesses in the material that you did not hear before you will like the comfort you will find the highs a bit exagerated
for those loosing hearing in the high end this would be a bonus you will find that a weak amp will make them sound like a tweeter no base or midrange at all you will find that nothing else in the price range offers this detailed sound
they are selling these at such a low price i suspect they are clearing out old inventory from a warehousewhether live or in the studio you have to worry about pronounced s sounds they can be harsh
well the s make some recordings sound like they didnt deess well enoughseveral years ago i bought a sennheiser  for some money and i consider that to be a bad purchase
a while ago i bought a sennheiser  for some money this one is a better choicethe headphone is huge but very light
it is tailored for symphony according to the description
indeed when i use it to listen to classic music i do like its smooth sound
the treble is clear but it is a little dark in the low frequencyfor vocals my grado sr does a much better job than the hd by presenting a spacious and liquid image
but hd is doing fine for classic music due to the smoothness of its sound
if you like relaxed sound then you will like hd but if you like warm and openness in sound this probably is not your cup of teathis cans is not very sensitive so you might need to have an amp to do it justice
considering spending money for a brand new hd there really isnt too much to complain aboutafter purchasing and returning a pair of  hds it was a pleasant surprise to listen to these
sound quality is far superior especially in the mids and highs
additional power is not required although probably recommended
the sound is bright and crisp even out of my laptop sound card
comfort is wonderful with virtually no strain after hours of use
my only recommendation would be to improve the jack connector but that is minor
the hd is a solid headphone with great sound and comfort
it may be a little pricey for some but if viewed as an investment it can be well worth the sticker price
if it wasnt for the somewhat high price it would definitely get five start from methe pocket pc platform is amazing but the jornada is not the best implementation
it is much smaller than the casio e and the flipup screen cover is great but i am returning it
hp has recently admitted the  device only displays  colors bit instead of the advertised   colors bit
now i know why web page graphics seem a little off
also the screen completely washes out in natural light even on a cloudly  day outside
im going to go with an ipaq insteadi have been lucky enough to have a jornada and lots of addons to try out for free
i am a long longtime user of palms and was quite a devoted  user have spent thousands over the years upgrading my palms buying  software adding memory etc
to get the most out of them
and im here to  tell youthere is way more you can do with a palm than microsoft would  have you believe
you can do more with a pocket pc out of the box than a  palm yes but there is tons more you can add on to a palm and most at a  very reasonable price than you can with the ppchaving said that the  jornada is a great piece of hardware
the color screen puts the palm to  shame
it almost hurts my eyes to look at my palm iiic now it is so  pixelated and ugly in comparison
the size is close to the palm iiic  although slightly heavier
its very nice to hold sleek and pretty
my  main complaint is the stylus i find it annoyingly hard to get out and i  dont like the flat shape
people are used to round pens i tend to drop  the stylus and have already lost one of them as a result
would also  prefer a cover that flips all the way backthe pocket pc os is much  better than ce  however the inability to close programs was a bad  omission and i ended up adding gigabar a great program that closes and  switches tasks among other things
while speed is better than older  versions i still run into things that take time where on the palm  everything happens almost instantly
there are a lot more things on the  pocket pc you will have to wait for
some addon software i looked at is so  slow as to be worthlessability to play mps is great if you even  consider carrying an mp player around
you can turn the screen off and  still listen to them which saves on batteries
in the car add the dc  adapter and it will charge your jornada while playing
you can also get  small volume boosters that will run on a single aa battery that can help  with battery life if mps are your thingnow for the bad stuff
there  is not much extra software out there
compared to the palm its really  really sparse
and a lot of what is there just isnt that good or as easy  to use
this is the biggest problem i have with the unit
i just cant do  some stuff i was used to doing or in some cases it would cost me way  more
some things that i used my palm for all the time i cant do now at  all
i miss wonderful programs like datebk and handbase
so easy to use  and low priced
not much like that for ppcthe screen on the jornada is  definitely a little hard to read outside but if you use the outdoors  setting it is readable other than in totally direct sunlight
i often read  books while in my car at lunch and find it easier than my palm iiic to  readi also dont like how heavily it is tied to ms stuff
i use  quickenthe pocket money directions for quicken users
switch to money
thanks but no thanks
pocket quicken on the palm does a great job for me
same with pretty much everything else
i prefer eudora for emailwith the  palm i can syncon the ppc i have to use outlook
i almost feel like it  is trying to force me into using more microsoft stuff than i already dofinally pricewise its going to cost you more
you can now get a palm  for 
yes you can expand memory on the ppcs but it costs money
a lot  of times you are getting more for your moneyi do believe the jornada is  worth the price more than the color palm is
but you still have to be  willing to pay the priceso what do i recommend
it really depends on  what you want
if you love cool gadgets like i do the ppc is a real  winner
i personally would probably recommend the ipaq over the hp for the  screen that is easy to read outside and more memory for the price
if you  dont expect to need more than the cf i slot though the jornada would not  be a bad choice
if you really love everything microsoft comes out with and  use everything they make this is the one to get
if however you want more  options in terms of what you can work with and what you can do the palm is  probably the way to goim a diehard palm user and i still keep my palm vii around for wireless internet access but the jornada really is a great device
the backlit screen has great color theres a slight problem with vertical banding when  theres a variety of different color brightnesses on the screen but its  still extremely readable much more so than the palm screenthe  microsoft reader application is wonderful i cant wait until some more  ebooks start coming out
a number of good publicdomain books are included  with the package thoughi have yet to have it crash but that could be  because im very conscientious about closing applications im no longer  usingsomething thats easy to do from the hp settings screen which is  called up by one of the hardware buttons
most of the crashes ive heard  about seem to revolve around having a fairly large number of applications  running until the poor thing finally runs out of memory and keels  over
if youre a creative type like me the builtin voice recorder is  a wonderful touch you dont have to switch applications or open the  jornadas cover or even turn it onjust press and hold the record button  on the side and start talking
you can later easily review the notes or  transfer them to the pc
if you plan on making extensive use of this  feature though you might want to buy a mb compactflash memory card  along with the jornada though as voice recordings made on the  highquality setting can use up memory in a hurrythe email capabilities  and pocket internet explorer are quite nice youll find these features  much more useful if youre already using outlook as your desktop email  program or if youre willing to switch
gee two microsoft products  working much better with each other than with thirdparty products
what a  surprise
 in conclusion i dont regret the purchase for a moment  and im already looking for a compatible cellular phone so i can start  making full use of email and the web while on the roadi had bought this for my jornada   yes i still have the pda and it works fine although it is very long in the tooth now  maybe someday i will be able to sell it to a museum  the screen protector has done a wonderful job over the years and has ensured that the endless solitare and other games have not scratched the lcd screen
a very fine product indeedthese little inserts work quite well
after removing the film from both sides the hard plastic piece just snaps right in
when the unit is on i dont see any screen quality degradation at all
when the unit is off i do see minor scuffs and scratches quickly but that is what the protector is there for
the size is almost perfect maybe a fraction to small as it moves just a bit but not much
i have not found that it makes writing recognition or dragging more difficult at all
a very useful and necessary accessory to any  or  series jornadai feel that the hp protectors are a musthave accessory but as with anything they have their ups and downs
the ups are obvious protection from annoying scratches and of course much easier application than the offbrand sticky protectors which are a huge pain in the ace to put on
the only thing that really annoys me about them is the way they scratch so easily but hey wouldnt you rather a cheap piece of plastic be scratched than the unreplaceable screen
thats right unreplaceable
hp cannot install new screens
the only option is to buy a new one
also the sensitivity is somewhat reduced in certain places more specifically the corners
if you want to take the risk go for it but if you want great protection get these nowwell let me add my two bits in
the screen protectors that i got had the green film on both sides but i only noticed the other side when my stylus peeled some of it off as i was writing and the instructionswhat instructions
were very unclear
i didnt have the problem of slipping that other people seem to have had
the little plastic sheet stayed right where it was and the screen seemed to remain sensitive at least to me
and yes the display is difficult to see in outdoors but that isnt anything new
you pay a pretty low amount for  pieces for plastic which basically prevent your veryhighamount screen from being damaged
from that point of view they are a definite bargain and worth the small amount of extra cashim glad i read some reviews before i bought these protectors or i might have been confused as well
i do find my stylus sliding a bit from time to time but it seems as though there are some positions for the protector that will lock it into place better
i usually remind myself that id rather have accuracy problems than screen scratches
i do wish hp had included better instructions with the protectors  in any event if you have a  series jornada theyre a good investmentsince i work at an electronics store i get to test and play with these things
i personally own a  and  mb rio  for the mb one i get several people returning their rio s all the time
a few of those their unit never worked at all but to most they returned it about  months in use or more
i have had my rio  mb for  year and  months now and it is still in great shape and works like a charm
why is this
it hasnt broke in  months because i have taken extremely good care of it
most peoples players die because they bend a small part in the hardware such as in the batteries
so when i do anything with the batteries i am extra careful
treat it like you are inserting batteries in a  year old artifact that will crumble if you are the least bit rough on it
dont try to insert the batteries in a hurry either
just be real careful and try not to drop it
also be careful when instertingtaking out the usb cable and headphones also to avoid bending anythingplayer prosconsprosnice appearancegood interface and fast connection speedone battery thank godlasts long if you take good care of itconsmb isnt enough expensive expansionbatteries dont last long and battery indicator is wrongyou have to take good care of itenjoyafter months of insisting i wasnt going to leap on the mp bandwagon ive become a firm convert to the joys and ease of electronic music and the rio diamond  is a big reason why
this stylish and easytouse pocket mp player is the perfect way to listen to mps on the go and shows every sign of becoming one of the top models in the fieldaffordable and easy to use the  packs a lot of features in a tiny package
the volume level is one of the best in the field of mp players taking spinal tap nine better the volume control goes up to  very loud in your house but sometimes necessary during noisy commuting
the controls are uncomplicated and easy to manipulate sightunseen if you have it in your pocket although learning how to hit quotpausequot without skipping to the next song is a talent youll have to practice
unfortunately theres no quotbookmarkquot function so if you stop the player in the middle of a file and want to pick up from that point youll have to fastforward manually to it
the blue plastic faceplate is removable and other colors are available to customize your rio
earplug headphones are included their sound quality is fine but youll probably want to stick with your favorite pair of stereo headphones
contrary to the amazon review there is a belt clipa neoprene case that attaches with a firm clip to belt or waistband
it also comes preloaded with quotnew musicquot that youll probably want to replace as soon as possiblebut including it gives you a nice way to test out your  on the way home from the electronics storehooking it up to my imac was simple and fast and i can download a full players worth of music to the  in a couple minutes
read the system requirements carefully thoyou need windows  or higher and a usbequipped mac with os 
a cdrom of bundled software gets you up and running quickly although its very annoying that the software is shareware and prompts you to pay the shareware fee every time you start up
when i pay for equipment and get software in a box thats absolutely necessary to run the equipment id expect that software to be totally included in the price of the playerive seen several complaints about s that dont work and i must admit that my first one was defective with lines running across the small display viewscreen
however this was easily returned and my second model has worked fine even with constant daily play or a few instance of dropping it on the subwaythe sole complaint i have is the usual one ive seen in most reviews mb of memory is far too small
you need at least mb of memory to get an hours worth of music recorded at mps
luckily there is an addon backpack which can increase your total memory to mb but that backpack isnt cheap about  the price of the rio  itself
announced future backpacks are supposed to be even larger and probably even pricier
diamond would have made me a fan without any complaints if the memory upgrades were less expensive or even universally compatible with other players
for this reason id recommend comparing it the rio diamond  basically the same machine with slightly redesigned controls and mb of builtin memoryok i had some savings in my pocket and i thought quothmmmwhat should i buyquot voila
i decided to get an mp playerrio
lets see what problems ive encountered with this nifty devicebattery pack on my first night with rio we started having problems
i had to figure out how to remove the batterymemory pack at the back of the unit
there was this little button that you press but nothing happens
to remove the battery pack you got to pry and clamp your nails around the edges to slide off the cover
taking it off was difficult putting it back was almost impossible
you have to align the connector pins between the pack and the unit and at the same time putting it at an angle so you can slide the cover back on
too cumbersome
requires getting to used topower guzzler this baby drains your batteries like hot milk
my suggestion is you buy rechargeable batteries alkaline rechargeables or nickel metal hydride batteries
if you dont invest on rechargeables youll be making frequent trips to the corner store for batteriesnow its on now its off by some weird phenomenon my rio kept shutting itself off
one minute its playing the next minute the system just shuts down
i reboot the unit and nothing happens
i reboot it twice three times and then it boots itself
hmmmm off i went to the store and had it replaced with a new one
now i got a new but the assembly was not done properly on the unit
a small opening can be seen on the sides
somehow somebody from diamond rio fell asleep while putting my unit together
off i went again and had it replaced
now everythings working normallythe software oh the humanity diamondrio needs to release a more stable software
its a bit too buggy
most of the time the software cant detect your usb connection to the unit
the workaround is to go to the options screen manually select the device connected to the usb
also theres a bug whereby if you delete some songs in your database it still leaves the files in your hard drive
weird reallynow the good pointswma files it takes wma files
since its only  mb wma can squeeze in more music into your player than mp at the expense of sound quality
wma is windowss answer to mp
wma usues kb as opposed to mps  kbsound quality sound is pretty decent when you listen to wma or mp
however with the wma the cymbals and high hats sound a bit wavy rather than a consistent hissing sound of a cymbalvolume this player packs a loud punch
this is really loud
im using a sony wear headphones and rio just knocks your ear drums off
not advisable to listen to full volume on extended periods
too riskyoverall the device is good except for a few quality control issues
its a shame because on the memory pack theres a label that says assembled in the usa
if youre planning to get this unit be prepared for some surprises like returning it and getting a new one
people have already complained about the poor quality control on this device
but that doesnt mean all the units are duds
who knows you might be lucky enough to pick a solid one
anyways the device is worth the money
its light its cheap its a got a solid sound qualityjust bought this little player from amazoncom in an unbeatable pricei like its good workmanship stylish and most importanthigh  qualily sound
the case fit nice and tight with a belt clip on the back
it is cushioned to protect it from dropping accidentallyinstalling the software is easy and when you register it online you can upgrade to a new basic version for freethe only thing i dont like is it uses its own back pack memory that means high price tag
it would be perfect if it takes smartmedia cardone more thing i dont like is the ear phone
my ears hurt after wearing them for awhilethis is a great little guy for taking a single disk on the road with you when you travel work out or mow the lawn
i was not looking for a place to store my complete music collection just something to use while waiting at the barber shop doctor oil change etc
this works perfectlyif you upgrade to the latest version of windows media player you can interface directly with this unit and not have to be bothered with additional software
using the wma format it sounds just fineit is not easily expanded but if that is what you are after get a minidisc so that expansion is as simple as buying additional low cost discsthe diamond rio  is a paradox
its twice as good as anything currently on the market but half as much as you need
theres something  very right about each of the three components of the systemheadphones  body and softwareand yet there are serious deficiencies with each  partthe rios headphones are  marginally tinny at any volume and  stressed at higher volumes but good enough for a portable youll probably  use in a noisy environment anyway
to be sure other headphones will be  needed to fully realize the sound possibilities of the rio but the ones  included give you at least the beginnings of great sound
their rather  odd aroundtheear construction is both sensible and awkward
theyre  perfect for using while working out because they never fall out  regardless of how vigorously one behaves
but theyre hard to get used to  because they do take a comparatively longer time to put in than other  headphones
serious audiophiles will dismiss them outright those of us  just looking for workout music will probably get used to their oddnessthe body of the rio is its clear strength
its about the size of a  pagerbut lighter
of all the portable music solutions i shoppedcd  cassette and digital alikethis one is the very best in terms of  sizequality ratio
its the best thing ive ever used for working out
its also the best device currently available in terms of expandability
though on the surface it seems to have less memory than the rio  and  than many other newer mp players it has the capacity for adding on   mb
also the fact that it takes the wma windows media format  effectively means that you can store what would be the equivalent of mb  of songs in the mp formatthere are some reservations though
first  its small size means that the battery is tucked away in a pretty  inaccessible place
its somewhat tricky seating a new battery
its not  impossible mind you and its worth the effort given the benefit of the  units small size but its still frustrating on occasion
second while a  battery does actually give  hours of use the units battery life  estimator is never accurate
it deducts time too slowly at the start of a  battery so that by the time you get to  hours of apparent time left you  actually have only  or  hours
its not a huge problem once you figure  it out but it can be infuriating at first
third the unit doesnt come  with a belt clip holder or an fm tuner
theyre both available but  theyre extra
i can understand the fm tuner being extra but it seems  ridiculous for a portable music player to come without the means to make it  truly portablefinally theres the software
easily the weakest  element of the diamond rio  its only a little more than a way to add  on  to the price of the unit
its entirely too difficult to install  and get running
i installed the version off the included cd
when i got  it running it linked me to rioportcom which informed me there was an  update available
this update however was really only for the rio   and  and so it failed to recognize the rio  as being present
so i  uninstalled the update and tried again with the cd version
then after a  mere  rips it told me i had to pay to unlock the program
so i tried  to unlock but the software never allowed me to get to the pay screen
i  then reinstalled the update and miraculously was allowed to unlock the  program
but this version still didnt recognize the rio   so i  uninstalled the update and reinstalled the original
finally everything  worked
hardly an encouraging start
then i instructed the program to  search my hard drives and come up with a database of playable media
this  it did but it found a lot of junk files i wanted to delete
unbelievably the program doesnt allow you to group delete so i had to  individually delete each file i didnt want
finally after hours of time  and  i got the software set up and ready to use
but then came another  one of those little rio paradoxes
one of the strengths of the software is  that it allows you to read a cd at a variety of different compressions
you can decide to fit more of your songs on the rio and sacrifice a little  quality
the problem is that you might want a song at the highest quality  to burn a cd which the software also does but at a lower one to send to  the rio
the result is that you practically have to read each cd twice
thats a lot of hard disk space to dedicate to your music library
hopefully updates will include some sort of converter so that you only  have to scan cds onceon balance i highly recommend the rio  especially if youre just looking for workout music
be warned however  that it wont be quite the effortless pathway to great music that the  merchandising proclaims and that the rio is based on modularity
it has  the greatest potential of any current mp playerit can be worn  comfortably has the largest potential memory can play fm music and can  even be used on your cars lighterbut youre going to have to pay for  each added functiondo you need a review
its like any other extension cable about  feet long white and extends powermore serious side its decently constructedi bought this to replace an orange cord i had in my front yard for christmas lights
the green color blended in better but the new cord is very stiff and wont lie flat on the ground at least not in the cold temperatures we have in winter here
so now the cord is more visible than the orange one since it loops up a few inches above the ground
we got  inches of snow which would have completely covered the orange cord but not the green oneworks just fine and plenty long for my needs
what are you waiting for
if you need it get it you probably wont beat the priceyes it is true this cable allows me to plug stuff in from across the room
i wanted white because i plug in my macbook power adapter
i can use one of the outlets on the other side of the room while sitting on the couch i am the coolest kid in the library
this will work for indoor or outdoor
cooooooolfinding quality extension cords that can endure the elements and still maintain its functionality is getting harder and harder these days
trust me there are a lot of posers with high ticket prices out on the store shelves
these low grade cords pop up on the radar especially during the holidays
for me these coleman cable  foot  extension cords has proven to be a winner
i especially like the heavy duty molding on both the plugs and connectors
after over twelve months continuous duty in both our front and back yards the vinyl covering has maintained its color very well
unlike the light weights out there ive found absolutely no peeling or breeches in the seal
that says it all for mewhite color blends in with molding and i finally have power at my fan on the other side of the patio enclosurebut i think its a bit too short for using it with the leaf blower
but thats my faultstill i couldnt be bothered to return it
having said that amazon paired it with the leaf blower saying other customers bought this
so its amazons fault
 or everyone else that bought this cord with that leaf blowerso it pretty much met my expectations
this is a pretty standard extension cord with a  ratio or power in to power out
i use it outside as it is described
i have not tried it insidei have a couple of this use them in the office and meeting rooms although this is supposed to be an outdoor extension cordit is sturdy and well made
the only thing is that the white color does get dirty after a while but hey its an utility cordi have been using this extension cord for a few months now with a radiator type oil heater
i was expecting the cord to heat up  short out
it has not done that
i live in a really old house  the circuit breakers kept flipping off when i was using this heater in my roomthe plus ins are far  few between  almost all the circuits are on the same breaker
i placed this cord across my room out the door  plugged it into a completely different circuit
it has been working great for mei like the white cause i can see if there is any electrical shorts if they occur in the cord
it is nice  thick  has been holding up just greatthe price was really good for my budget
great buy nothing special serves the purpose and is reasonably priced
for some reason local stores do not carry them in stocki recently purchased one of these recorders and found it to be quick easy and no fuss
it has great functionality and the external input is a good touchi bought the polaroid  for my son a  year old that loves to take pictures
this camera seemed to have it all decent resolution a flash usb connection video cable to view the pictures on tv x zoom and macro focus mode  quality settings an optical viewfinder to save batteries ac adapeter included photomax software shot timer wrist strap and a durable case design with padded vinyl casewhen it arrived my son took about  pictures the first day and although many of them were horrible it didnt cost a thing to develop
the rechargeable nicad batteries that i bought specifically for this camera were terrible and they ran out after about  pictures even with the display turned off
i tried some aa rechargeable nimh batteries from my sons remote control car and they lasted  or  times longerwith the mb compact flash card you can only get  to  pictures in the highest resolution and since we wanted to use most of the good photos in a screensaver at fullscreen on a  x  monitor the high setting is the lowest acceptable quality
ill probably buy a mb card soon and that will let him take over  pictures in the highest quality mode before the card is fullas far as the picture quality goes you pretty much need to use the flash all of the time
you can take nice pictures  outdoors in the sun without the flash but thats about itthe macro function works very well but you need to make sure you are very close to your subject
my  year old daughter got in my lap one night so i grabbed the camera and took a few pictures of her looking at me from less than a foot and they were incredible
with my  slr camera i couldnt get that close and still be in focus so those types of pictures will be priceless when the kids are oldermy only major gripe about the camera is that its not very quick to switch modes which requires using the display screen menu system
then your custom settings seem to last as long as you leave the power on and then it reverts back to the default settings
for example if you set the flash to always on take a few shots then turn the power off to save batteries when you turn it on again a few minutes later the flash is back in auto mode and wont necessarily fire on your next picture
since you always need the flash this is an annoyance that bugs me
the x zoom feature works the same way you need to activate this option using the menu and when you turn the power off the camera goes back to the default settingsin summary considering that i got this camera for less than  its an incredible bargain
i didnt expect it to capture images that i could print   x  photos
i mostly wanted a way for my son to take all the pictures he wanted share them on the computer screen or tv and possibly print a few on  x  photo paper
for what my son needs this is a perfect camera at a perfect price
if you can get one for less than  go for it but make sure you have some good rechargeable aa batteries to use with iti would like to take some pictures of everything that i owned just for the last five years
and to get a value on two art worksi have used these cameras many times on vacation and the pictures really did come out fairly well
oh sure the quality of the pictures wont be  as good as the pictures you would get from a digital camera or a standard more expensive and more professional  mm camera
the pictures may at times be slightly grainy but they provide excellent records and memories of my experiencesthe camera also is very lightweight so you can carry several at a time in a bag as you travel
i especially like the built in flash that is easy to use just push a button in the back of the camera and after  seconds or so the flash is ready
i remember my mothers kodak instamatic camera from the s when if your flash cube had been used after only four pictures you were out of luck unless you had another flash cube
no such problem here
thank goodnessthe camera is a single use camera this means that after you use it you take the entire camera to the place where you can get film developed and they will take care of the rest
no worrying about whether or not you removed the roll of film negatives correctly without exposing them to too much light
the kodak max  film speed also makes it useful for taking pictures under a wide variety of lighting situations
you get  exposures not just a nice plus
smileoverall this is an excellent camera for the many many people who want to travel light or who are on a budget
it is compact and easy to carry keep one in the glove compartment of your car just in case theres an accident and you need to take pictures of the scene
the camera is also affordable
i give it four stars instead of five simply because the picture quality just isnt the very best although for most people like me the pictures it takes are fine
thank you kodakive had a couple other brands of speakers all comparably priced
i dont listen to much music on my speakers only system sounds and my computer games mostly and they perfectly suit my needsthe speakers are weak not clearly audible in the extended upper and lower regions
theyre pretty powerful for their size and ive been happy with their range of sound for most of my needs
if i were going to listen to cds on my computer a lot id pay the little extra for the next series up by labtecthe plugs for headphones and microphone at the front of the left speaker have come in handy for me
its a nice bonusif youre looking for inexpensive powered speakers these are a great buyi bought these with the intent of using them until i could afford something decent and to my astonishment ive been using them ever since
for the size and the age theyve got surprisingly good sound
theyre a goodinexpensive upgrade from nonpowered to powered speakers but they wont substitute for a good sound system to music and movie connoisseurs
for the price and durability you cant beat them
great for a kids room or for that secondary pc you dont use that often
or buy them to get you through until you can get a good sound system you may find yourself using them a lot longer than you had anticipatedi bought a qvex last year prior to a month trip to europe where i found myself using it nearly as much as my slr camera
the beauty of onthespot review and even deletion of a photo is greatsomething no film camera can do
at the time and continuing since then i have used the camera quite a bit and have a strong overall opinion of it but with some complaints
the complaints dont take away enough to drop my rating below  stars but they do exist as followsfirst the viewfinder provides a distorted nonlinear view if the camera is not held perfectly vertical fortunately the recorded image is still ok  also while not unexpected there is considerable parallax error with closein photos in which case the image on the screen should be trusted over the viewfindersecond there is no provision for a screwin filter on the lens as available with the nikon coolpix models
in general neither problem is critical but rather an annoyance
given all the features of this camera that can pretty well satisfy even an advanced photographers needs the lack of screwin filter support seems an oversightthird there is no external flash connection
ive been quite surprised that redeye in several photos has been minimal to nonexistent even when the subjects eyes seem directly facing the camera
luck perhaps as redeye does still occur occasionally
although flash quality is good i know from experience that it can be improved significantly and redeye totally avoided if i use offcamera flash
fortunately i was able to rig up a small flash deflector that i attach to the camera with a small strip of velcro bouncing the flash to trigger a slaved offcamera flash unit
that has provided excellent results and any exposure errors can be immediately previewed and corrected using the lcd screenfourth battery drain  with the use of the ibm microdrive major selling point of the camera battery drain is quite significant and even with mah nimh batteries i still observe indications sooner than id expect that the batteries are getting low
those indications include the slightly longer delay time in saving a photo to disk and a prompt in the lcd screen to cancel the save if desired
if i anticipate that as a problem for any planned photography i switch to using a mb compact flash card which provides improved battery performance and faster saving of photos
i recently purchased an external rechargeable mah sakar digital camera battery pack at frys electronics and the initial impression is that it will provide me with better battery performance than the nimh aa batteries the only inconvenience is then leaving the door open on the camera where the dc power cable attachesfifth  low light focusing  quite poor
sometimes this problem can be worked around by selecting either the manual or infinity focus option
more often i just have to look for some other nearby person or object at a similar distance away and in better lighting and use that to establish a prefocus point before returning to my subjectthose items notwithstanding i very much enjoy this camera and highly recommend it
most notable is the compatibility with the ibm microdrive even at the expense of increased battery drain
lens quality a canon lens is excellent and color rendition seems very good
the mb image size is sufficient to obtain photoquality xinch prints when printed on my epson  printer and passable xinch prints
using adobe photoshop to further edit my x prints by applying filter effects that render more of a watercolor look to the photos i have obtained some very nice quotartisticquot prints in exchange for a tradeoff of the photoquality sharpness
stilhave successfully slaved my camera to an external flash in a manual exposure mode
to avoid red eye induced by oncamera flash i fashioned a small cup of plastic to deflect the camera flash upwards triggering the remotely slaved flash only
the cup can be easily attached via a small strip of velcro
while ive rarely used any flash at all the slaved flash setup does provide better results than the oncamera flashof special note are two quothiddenquot features of the camera that i learned of from imagingresourcecom as followsuncompressed tiff mode  resulting in a mb file size that takes  seconds to save between shots this does provide a way to capture more detail if the need arises
the one problem is that the tiff is a nonstandard format that many programs cannot read properly
acdsee and irfanview are two windows programs that can open and resave this tiff format in a standard format that yields a mb file size
to access this mode on the camera press the set and flash buttons simultaneously in any capture mode
turning off the camera will disable this featuremanual exposure  this was particularly useful when i devised my flash deflector for the slaved offcamera flash
if you hit the set button and the left arrow button simultaneously while in shutter priority mode you are put into a full manual mode that lets you control both aperture the left and right arrow buttons and shutter speed the up and down arrows
using a slaved vivtar  flash offcamera in automatic mode i set the camera the the aperture setting specified by the flash expsosure calculator dial
an advantage over an slr camera is that the digital camera can be set to whatever shutter speed is desired there is no focalplane shutter vignetting of the image to worry aboutso all in all this camera provides a wealth of features to explore but there remains room for improvement
would i buy it again today over the competition
most likely i would but what ive learned would also find me studying all the cameras just that much more closely
at the time of purchase this was the only mb digital camera i could find that offered the range of features i desired and the storage capacity i soughtfinally ive just learned about some freeware software for this camera at dicasoftde that allows the use of a pc to control the camera automatically
while such needs are nonexistent for me at the moment they may be fun to toy withprosimage quality and quantitythe ex is a true  megapixel camera which will give you x resolution max
at this and the minimum compression you can achieve  pictures on the microdrive
if you drop the resolution to a mere x most likely the size of your screen or larger you can get  images on the disk
thats alot of snappingfeatures second mpgs no sound shutter speed priority aperture priority clean back lit lcd screen panoramic
shots and special modes for portraits night shots and landscapes
color bw sepia modes redeye reduction flash macro mode time stamp x optical zoom
x digital and superbly done usb connectivityusb interface
hate having to use a proprietary interface to get your images off a camera
youll love this
pop in the usb cable and windows automatically sets it up as a removable disk drive
thats right you can sure the camera as if it was a hardrive from inside your my computer
or press a button and have then all automatically loaded and displayedease of use even using the advanced features its a very simple to use camera
everything is menu driven and in a logical formatconsbattery life
if you decide to use the lcd screen alot the batteries do not last long at all
if you dont on the other hand theyll last for about  shots
not too badto get full  megapixel uncompressed tiffs you must find the secret option to enable it
warning by enabling uncompressed tiff you will get about  shots before the card is full
tiffs are  uncompressed raw image datasize its a little bit large for me
not too bad and for what it does its decent but if youre running around it can get bothersome to carry
the canon elph digital mp is more like what id want to haul around crips highs clear voices and instruments not overpowered lows thats how i resume the sound performance of the very amazing hd  the only drawback for me is the pale esthetic of the cans otherwise i would have given all  starsthere have been so many reviews here i almost didnt write one but with the lack of reviews by producers i decided to add one more to the listif youre producing audio like myself you already know theres no replacement for a good set of monitors
that said theres a few reasons you may be mixing through a set of cansmy reasons are that my studio is sometimes mobile and that im often mixing in my apartment ive found that boxers and a tshirt are a superior choice for studio apparelim running an mbox with protools  sometimes switch to nuendo dont hate me hush now abelton usersi also use these with my ivory keys vst and it sounds pretty nice i think they add a bit of warmth when compared to a set of mackies could be the spatial difference but i actually like it better through the senns a bit more personal i guessthat said i feel pretty happy with the sound from these cansive been using them for almost a year now extensivelytheyre a bit lacking in the lowends when i push them but when you pair them up with an analyzer you can usually compensate pretty nicely with a combo of visual and audio referencethey are openear so dont expect your vocalists to be using them in the sound booth or youll be recording the sound coming from the headphones along with the vox
for the producer the only real place for these is in the mix down if youre trying to be quiet or your one of those weirdos who uses cans for some bizarre voodoo mixing ritual
ive heard of these guys but never met onethey are definitely more comfortable than some of the other headsets ive tried grados being the least comfortable sonys arent badsometimes i seem to put them on wrong and my ears start hurting pretty quickly but if i slide them around on my head a bit so my ears are good and centered i can wear them for a few hours before i need to take em offi think the most important thing to note here is my experience with sennheisers customer servicerecently i snapped the headset in half dunno if it was from cheap plastic construction or just lots of use
regardless i contacted senn and asked what i needed to do assuming id have to send them in and wait a week to get them fixed
instead senn offered to just send me a new headband and i could replace it myselfbecause of the modular construction of these cans that will be pretty easy to do and lets me keep using them while i wait for my replacementneedless to say that made me pretty happythe cords firmly snap in and out of the cans via  pronged plugs nice for those who accidentaly step on the cord while they stand upon a consumer level note if you are listening to mps or any compressed audio format in a portable device or any device for that matter dont buy these youre wasting your moneyim not insulting you im being seriousthere are cheaper alternatives for compressed audioif you like your music and cant blast your speakers for some reason or the other then id say these are a pretty nice set
not the best for sound but close enough that the price and comfort make up for the slight difference you may hear in a set of very uncomfortable gradosfor those of you who are worried about reproducing the original sound of a recording you need to laugh at yourself for a minute and realize that we process those sounds pretty thoroughly before we even bounce them to a track
compressors eqs verbs etc sometimes before the signal even hits the sound card its gone through a preamp
aside from that the difference between audio still in the daw and a bounced track is pretty dramatic
youre just not going to hear what we hear in the studio
go with what you likesome like it crispy some like it warmif you can listen to your favorite track through the headphones before you decide to buy them do thatleave em on your head for a while see how they fiti recommend trying them out if your searching for a setthey work nicely for my purposesi always used sony headphones since the sound quality is quite nice and it is priced reasonably
i ended up buying this headphone through lightning deal
after listening to various type of music anywhere from classical to trance my overall rating for sound quality is  stars yet due to its low volume i give  for totalthese are excellent audiophile headphones no doubt about it
their reproduction of sound is superior and there is no attempt to render the sound excessively bassy or to otherwise alterdistort whatever signal the source happens to deliver
this actually is a mixed blessing since many contemporary listeners now seem to expect a exaggeratedly bassheavy sound from their headphonesthese are gorgeously made high quality phones but they are not for everyone
the potential drawbacks to using these headphones are several
first the hd does such a fine job of amplifying input that it will render all the clearer any flaws in the audio system to which it is hooked up
consequently using these with a very cheap overall sound system can actually backfire
second the impedance associated with these phones is very high so they will not produce much volume when used directly with a portable cd or md player
you need to use a headphone amplifier with any portable or other lowoutput device
third the design of these headphones is of the open variety
this helps in their superior sound reproduction but it also means that if you are in a crowded room listening to music everyone around you will know just what you are listening to and may not be as pleased with the experience as you are
if you need isolation you are better off buying either closed headphones or else even better some firstrate ear canal phones such as the etymotic ersfinally as has already been pointed out these headphones are quite luxuriant in their onear padding but as a result they can become uncomfortably hot or itchy to wearwith those caveats in mind these are still among the best stereo headphones currently made and if you understand beforehand just what to expect with the hds you will surely enjoy themsennheiser hd is one of the best headphones in the market which offers exceptional sound quality at a price much lower than one has to pay for comparably good speakers
they are often compared to grado rs or sony mdrf
although it is extremely hard to find a place where you can compare all three of these topoftheline models those people who had this chance agree that the difference in sound quality is so subtle that it is a matter of personal taste which one to preferthe sound quality of hd has been discussed in several reviews posted before mine
i can only add that the best way to hear the difference is to listen to the classical music or to jazz where natural sound is paramount
electronic music will sound good also in much cheaper headphones
there are several things which i learned from my experience that were not mentioned in reviews posted before mine breakin period
as taken from the box hd sounded not better than  headphones from a local drug store and i was very close to returning them
however i accidentally found on the web that headphones need a breakin period ie they are supposed to play for about  hours before they can reach their full sound potential
the sound quality transformation after the breakin period was truly amazing and the difference between hd and cheap headphones became striking
with a  ohms impedance hd need quite some power
neither portable cd players nor computer sound cards can drive them  the volume is low and the bass is gone completely
this was the only thing about hd that i got disappointed with  they can be used only with a dedicated high quality amplifier
it is possible that headphone jacks on dvd and cd players may also be not adequate
i ended up buying a creek obh headphone amplifier in order to have something that can drive my hd and provides the sounds quality that i expected
many people say that hd is very comfortable
frankly i saw more comfortable headphones
it may be a matter of the head size i am a big guy but i would be happy if the pressure on my ears could be reduced
i am getting tired of wearing hd after about  minutesbut the sound is great im a planarortho guy both in speakers and headphones
i have a set of hifiman hes that i was enjoying until they were dethroned by a set of audeze lcd
i absolutely love the audeze and find them to be extremely neutral do we really know what neutral is though
with my hifiman ef amp with a seductive midrangebut this review is about the hd
a friend lent me his extremely tweaked bottlehead crack and his hds since the crack will not drive my planars well
my god i really love the hd on that amp
after doing some comparisons and finding that it is very true that the crack will not drive lowimpedance cans well i pulled out my little schiit magni to do more listening
the senns sound fabulous on that amp too and so do the lcd and in my opinion best the senns just by a bitso thats a lot of typing to give some background
i just wanted to say that it would be highly unlikely for anyone to be disappointed by these headphones
i found them to be really great sounding even in the company of my audeze cans so i might just have to have a set if only to be able to enjoy say otl headphone ampsi think these should be on your short list if you want some accurate headphonesi ordered these headphones for my homestudio
i was torn between these headphones and a pair of shure s
i feel shure makes better microphones but you cant compare headphones and micsso when i got them i opened up the oversized box and tried to plug them into my ipod to try them out
oops
i need a oneeight inch adapter
you would think for the money it would come with thatso i got my adapter plugged them into my ipod and oops
these headphones are not very loudso i went into the settings on my ipod and turned the sound up all the way turned the volume up all the way and  oops
why arent these expensive headphones blasting my ears outi guess you have to sacrifice volume to get qualitythey sound crisp and cleari have a pair of these in my library
for a small speaker theyre pretty good but i like chamber music and in particular string quartets
i find the closemiked string reproduction generally boxy and have to play them at background levels otherwise i find the sound annoying
piano reproduces well as do vocals
i found they were very susceptible to sympathetic vibration when i placed them on bookshelves or small tables and ended up buying a pair of sanus speaker stands see my review which has improved the sound considerablyi had the nice little bose accoustamass speakers for big clear sound from my leftrightcenter channels
i had the powerful infinity subwoofer to thump the neighbors right off their sofabut what to buy to replace those ancient rear speakers id gotten for free with a soso stereo so many years agoi didnt want to spend much money for mere rear channel sound but i didnt want to compromise much quality either
frankly it seemed a waste to spend any money at all back therethen i heard wharfedales diamond anniversery bookshelf speakersthey look great they sound great
and amazon has a price you just cant beatnot only do my dts and dolby  movies sound better than ever but my neighbors find me just a little bit more bothersomeupdate  weve moved into a bigger house and are now using these as our main speakers in upstairs living room
they sound so delicious i realize they were wasted as mere rearchannel speakers back at the old condo
theres no better deal in bookshelf speakers today
buy thesethese binocs are greatpros easy focusing knob bright powerful zoom and lightweightcons eyepieces can be a pain with big glassesthe carrying case and neck strap are nicely desigend as well
get these binocsafter installing this care which took all of  min
everything was great and i was browsing and transferring files againhad no problems getting this to work
the other one i had still works i mainly got this for back up purposesthe network component on my old intel mb was not supported by windows  server r
i ordered this card to enable me to use the mb with windows server  r
it works perfectly
card is recognized on install and driver loaded automatically
later i upgraded to windows server  and the card works perfectly with that version of the server product also
easy to install and didnt have to bother with the install cdi ordered this when i was still in the middle of fixing my problem of my cable modem disconnecting during any sort of downloading thinking it was my onboard nic starting to go badit turned out not to be the nic cards or the routers but instead the original cable splitter i got from my cable company went bad and was causing all the disconnects
i am still using this over my onboard nic now and it seems to work great so far and have not had any problems with it at allthe drivers install quickly and was very easyeven grabbed the latest ones online that i could find and those work well alsothe only weird part with this nic card that i have never seen was this card would get no link light on my cable modem when plugged directly into iteven the link light on the back of the nic card would not turn green
so in turn it would never get an ip and was not able to get on the internetas soon as i would plug it into my router i would get a link light on both the router and the nic card and it would grab a ip from the router instantly and i was all set to go
now this isnt a big deal for me but there is still quite a bit of ppl out there that just hook directly up to their cable modems and this could cause problems unless its some sort of defect with minei gave it  stars because of this
this doesnt matter much for me or most people with a routerbut can cause some problems like i had when i was trouble shooting my connection and was trying to rule out any problems with my router and could not directly connect to my modem with this cardthis card is worth the money
however make sure you install the drivers for the nic card first as it will lock up your pc on bootup without doing this first
it clearly says this in the installation documentation though butwho reads thati had no issues with the rj not snapping into place as another review stated
it has been working fine for weeks now on my parents computerdefinately has the best color screenperformance is fast and i like the new interface and programs especially ms reader
you can read ebooks and listen to audiobooks from audiocom both from within ms readermy only  complaint is that the device seems to slow down after opening more than   or  programs
also i have needed to quotrebootquot the machine more  than with my e but it has not been troublesome for meoverall great  product and great performancenote this is actully a   starsthere are two types ofpeople those who are organized and those who arent
for thosepeople who arent one of the best solutions at least to get your days activities in order is to buy a pda
but then there is the problem of which ones to choose
right now there are two that top my list the cassiopia e and the palm vx that review will be up shortly after this onea powerhouse in a rather small package sporting a very high  mhz processor and  megs of ram a fancy  bit screen as well as the new os avidly named quotpocket pcquot the cassiopia e has almost gotten to that fine line thats one step above a pda and one step below a laptop
not only does it have programs built into it like outlook notepad word and internet explorer pocket but it also allows you to play mps and movie files on it in full bit glory
also unlike its rival pda the palm vx it recognizes your style of writing freeing you from having to learn the grafiti handwriting style programed in palm vx os
and switching back and forth between programs has been made even easier by the addition of a navagation wheel that is located on the front of the cassiopia
for instance if youre using internet explorer pocket and you want to get back to word simply press the button and the screen changes back to word and vice versatrouble in paridise like its previous models the  and the  the  has a rather short battery life of only  hours which means that after a full days use it has to be recharged
also if you use its modem sold seperatly mp player or video player during the day it will use up the energy in the battery even quicker
another problemits rather bulky and heavy at around  to  oz with the battery compared to the palm vx at only  oz with the battry
finally the transfer rate between the cassiopia and the computer with the included cradle is rather slow at only around  kbps which can make mp or large file transfer tedious and time consuming when compared to the transfer rate of the palm vx although it cant play mpswhich one is for me
 the answer to the question of which one to buy comes down to what you really plan to do with it
if you need a very powerful and easy to use portable device that can replace your large laptop then you need the cassiopia
however if you want a slim and stylish pda that is very simple to use and that will organize your life rather than complicate it with more programs and systems than you need get the palm vx
my review on that one should be up soonthe highs great os beautiful visuals powerhouse of a pdathe lowshowever its a bit pricey at around  dollars short battery life relay between computer and pda is slow not a huge jump from the e except for the extra megs and the osthe lowdown casio has been able to create a great line of pdas that have a nice blending of the best of palm with the best of a laptop
however it may not fit the likes of everyone who tries it
and until the price comes down a bit you might want to go with the e  and for its price the palm vx still leads overall in the pda departmentpower organization style ie
looks weight etc
  extras visuals overall not a sum revuman too much of a good thing is never enoughpeacei am so glad i finally bought this device after so many months of scrutinising the competitors
i almost settled on the em until a comparison of specs showed it to be virtually the same in lookeffect but an inferior unit in grunt only mb of internal ramease of use the e is very easy to use  a pulldown start menu at the top left will get you in or out of any program instantly
the down side is there is no little x at the top right to close your programs and you can either live with them simply opening on top of each other eventually slowing you down or so im told or you can make six yes six taps to get to the correct setting option to shut them down
while this sounds immensely annoying i discovered it wasnt really and i just adapted only going to close programs when i got to more than three open at once
and even with six programs running i noted no discernable loss of speed
further the downloadable taskpro navigator program was written to fix this ce problem for those who go nuts with more than one open program and want to close as they goreadibility the color is fabulous  and booksdocumentsreport reading one of the two main reasons i bought this are excellent on the eye even after two or three hours of reading
nice big screen  no greengrey backgrounds the early palms et al which make me drowsy and my eyes achey after twenty minutes
e comes with microsoft reader so you can also download books for even easierontheeyes reading
i love reader mode
top marksdesign flaws there are five obvious design flaws one the ac adaptor plug is on the bottom left side of the device and when propped up in bed reading you get it jabbing annoyingly into your chest
sometimes i run it on batteries just to avoid the digging in power cordtwo the power button on the left side of the device can be bumped easily
while it doesnt matter if you bump it off it always restarts with exactly what you had on your screen when working  even your music starts up exactly where you left off
brilliant
it does have a problem that when you are sliding the unit into the case provided it can bump on and without knowing it it could be powered on inside the case draining down the batteries
thus i now put it in the case and try and sneek a peek to see if it is on
not easy and yes i immediately ordered a different style of case asap to prevent thisthree  serial port connection
not a flaw so much as a bad decision
god you could grow old and grey waiting for this thing to download an mp
takes me an hour on average for a four minute song
i want a usb cable
still when you think about it once youve downloaded all of what you need like your favorite songs youre all set
apart from the occasional report which in contrast takes only a minute or so to download you wont really spend your life downloading stuff onto it
and if you want more than a dozen songs constantly updated you probably should consider buying an mp player insteadfour the record button is on the left of the unit  handy if you want instant access i suppose but given most people arent journalists needing that quote in three seconds or less a less accessible record button would be preferable
i am often bumping it and recording instantly a marvellous assortment of background sound without intending to
nice waste of memory space that if youre not careful
on the other hand it is a pretty fabulous function in the first place and i like how you can easily name your sound bites and treat them like any other programfive when you listen to music the three front buttons are instantly reconfigured and can be reprogrammed as a mini remote
therefore the button you usually use to scroll down in a document may be for example programmed to fast forward
now what if you wanted to read a document and listen to music
setting the button at none in the program still disables it from its nonmusic scroll mode
so you have to use your pen to scroll down the document while listening to music regardless of whether the buttons are allocated a new function in windows media mode
another small aside  sometimes the music pauses as you open and close new programsinternet and email those wanting this unit for the internet browsing ability when you buy optional extra the modem card i do not recommend it
its taken an eternity for me to configure this correctly to go online and it still wont let me access some sites like hotmail and google for no reason i can fathom
some tell me its just the nature of the windows ce environment
if this is so  and net browsing is why you bought it its a ripoff
fortunately it wasnt what i needed it for so i dont care so much
and it may just be my human error so do more research
meanwhile i still cant figure out how to configure it to send an outlook email from it despite reading every instruction i could find although mercifully there are some sites i can surf to and send an email from there so its not an impossible problem
meanwhile its synchronisation between pc and unit with outlook express is trouble free but it wont synch with any other mail programs you might use on your pc like eudorapictures nice clear vivid images
youll love how they come upsound oh baby heres where i go nuts
a builtin mp player that you dont have to use earphones to use
you can just hit play and wow a roomful of your friends
its excellent
lovely quality and it compares well with the topoftheline iomega hipzip mp player i also owncalendarappointmentscontact so easy to use and sort it was a godsend
and with the today menu button you can always see at a glance whats up with your tasks appointments and mails
excellent
contact list is brilliant and you can store multiple phone numbers and emails for the one personsummary  the flaws sound worse than they are
this has proved to be a most savvy purchase
with mb inbuilt and endlessly expandable thanks to the type compact flash card slot on the back youll be set forever if you want
the ac adaptor means even if you kill the battery and cant find a new one you can still use it till the day you die
the color is so amazing you have to see it to believe it and the mp player is of a fine quality
for those who need it to read lots of stuff this is absolutely the right unit
accept no substitutes
theres plenty of programs to download too and i doubt ill ever tire of it
unless ithey fix the internet problems depending on who is responsible i wouldnt recommend it for this
but for every other function id give it  out of only had it a day but it appears to be pretty awesome and it should  for the price
you can get a whole pc for the price
the usb  connection is by far superior to the old serial connects for synch speed
transferred  contacts in  secsonce the expansion sleeves hit the  market october i think this one is a winnerso i finally managed to get my hands on the ipaq pda
i was tempted to  write a completely unobjective review but after a day with the new gadget  i think i will do just the opposite
at a local cafe i sat down with a  frapuccino and the new package to see what was it all about
the packaging  is very nice divided between the hardware from compaq on one side and the  software bundle from microsoft on the other
compaq included a very nice  demo cd of the product which pretty much goes through all the details of  setting up your ipaq nice job
they also included a booklet for the  accessories service and a quick tips cardmicrosofts software bundle  was a little more on the massmarket side you know less details
this  includes the active sync cd and the software license for outlook  the  cd also includes some extras like the avantgo client highly recommended  and about  megs worth of ebooks mostly classic novels
my wife saw  the ipaq and went nuts she just loved the look and the guy sitting next to  me at the bar was watching the entire process through the corner of his  eye
i think i was more interested in finding about what i can do with this  thing
i can tell you nothing much at the time cause when i tried to turn  it on i could not there is a switch at the bottom that you have to move  before using itthe ipaq is very nice looking but you will have to  get used to it especially if you come from palm land
it is not a pocket  pc despite whoever says otherwise
it is just about the same size of the  palm iiic and only wearable when you have a jacket on
the rest of the  time you will have to carry it on your hand or in a briefcase or pursethe quick access buttons are very small and on the ipaq i still dont get  what the arrow means nor the italic q isotype
the logos on the calendar  button and contact are very unexpressive and reminiscent of the outlook  icons for both apps not very good father figures
the arrow button will  launch a quick launch manager with all your apps you have to create a  shortcut every time you install a programabsurd
the q button launches  a qmenu with some useful choicesthe ipaq does not have a direct  button to the programs window and this makes it difficult to navigate  especially if you dont like the compaq qstart utility like me
you have to  go through the start menu pretty much for most of your choices and it  still doesnt include all of them so be prepared to do a few clicks to get  to a program you have not recently used
there are no direct buttons to the  volume control nor to the brightness utility and there are only few quick  access buttons so it pretty much rules out reprogramming them
i guess  compaq engineers forgot these are consumer products
finally i guess  most of the bulk of the software i want is on a pocket pc pack that you get  if you register via the pocketpccom website
the thing is they are going  to ship mine in three weeks
dont you think it should be included in the  package
i guess microsoft wants to know who is buying these things since  they are the deliverersto conclude the quick access buttons need  some revision not to mention they should put some more the screen is  simply a palm killer kudos for the silver vader gothic look and the  software still needs some more brain storming
simple is better hasnt  gotten palm to  million fellows for nothing
if you have a palm v you  will definitively want to carry that one on you and the other on your  pocket your briefcase pocket that isi had an ipaq  before this unit
that unit was a replacement for my palm iiixe
each time i have changed my handheld it has been a step up
now going to the  has been a giant step forwardthe color screen is great
it is well lit easy to read
the programs that come with the unit halp me keep myself organized at home or on the road
i already used microsoft outlook to organize everything while at my desk
the activesync software that comes with the ipaq automatically found all my appointment calendars and contacts and put them into my ipaq for mesure it only has mb of storage
but i have hundreds of contacts  eamails per day and i subscribe to avantgo for offline web broiwsing and i never get near the maximumif i want to store some music files i just add a mb compact flash card and i have plenty of space
that mb card can store about  and a half albums when compressed into wma format
i use my ipaq on planes as a music player similar to an mp player cant call it an mp player if i use wma files can i
all i do is hook up my headphones turn on the media player included with pocketpc software and put the player in my breast pocketthe only thing i would like to see is longer battery life
i regularly travel and after  hours of continuous use i have to recharge itone accessory i would recommendi picked up a usb sync cable that also recharges the battery from your usb port
its great when on the roadone cable both charges and syncs up the ipaqothers have pretty much said it
great unit
a bit bulky with the dual expansion sleeve but fast and functionali am using a dlink wireless card with a wireless b access point both at home and work
i can now quickly and easily check email or look up a website and carry it around
it did take a bit of research getting thw wireless to work thoughthe ipaq is also pretty pricey once you get the jacket the network card and expansion memory or an ibm microdriveconsidering the age of this product and possible compatibility issues with vista this works quite well and does what i need it to do most  keep my appointments in sync and carry reference acrobat and ebooksthis is what it is and it is good for that
i got it for my yearold for camping
a very basic small radio
works great for her and for a takealong camping radio she can use as she wishesthis works for me for what i wanted though there are some things that make it less than perfect
the highest volume is fairly low but i really dont have a problem with that as some might
my only real problem with the radio is that the tuning wheel is very small and touchy
i have problems finding the station i want to listen to because it is so close to others
my old hands have trouble making such fine tuning
but for the price its hard to beat
quality is not a problem even at this price less than  at the time i bought itgreat little radio with excellent fm reception
am could be a little better but of course this is a very small radiothis is like the little radio you had years ago when you were a teenager before boomboxes where the thing
it has great reception and sound we are actually using it hooked up to two tiny speakers we had but it works great alone tooi recently purchased the panasonic rfp because i was in need of a portable radio that has a built in speaker
i have discovered that this is hard to come by in a brick and mortar store
so i did a little search on amazoncom and came across this producti also own its direct competitor  the sony icfsmkthe panasonic radio is great because i can carry it around anywhere and always have music with me where ever i go
i especially like to use it in hotel rooms when i go on trips but its also nice to have in order to listen to music in all of the rooms of my apartmentthe panasonic rfp has a telescoping antenna which can be swiveled back and forth and onoffvolume switch band selector and tuning dial
the speaker measures at  and a half inchesi live in a basement apartment so it is not always easy to get a fantastic signal
i have discovered that this radio pulls in all the major fm stations quite easily  although sometimes i have to fiddle with the tuning and antenna to get a good receptionthe few local am stations can be pulled in as wellthe appearance of this radio is quite nice
it appears that panasonic has taken some time into building a radio that is pleasing to the eye
its a pocket radio with a nice contemporary look
the radio frequencies are listed on the unit quite clearly  much bigger than what ive seen on similar units from other companies
also the tuning light which lets you know when youve locked on to a strong station just right is bright and easy to seethis panasonic pocket radio comes with a wrist strap
this is one of my only gripes
i wish it came with both a wrist strap and a belt clip
another nice feature that would make this radio better is if one could remove both the wrist strap and belt cliphow does it sound
keep in mind its a pocket radio youre not going to get huge sound as you would with a stereo system
however for its tiny size the speaker sounds surprisingly good
the sound quality sounds clear but not too tinny
ive ehard models with much harsher sound
also dont expect glass shattering bass you wont find it here
but as i said for its size it has a pleasant soundin comparing this model to the sony competitor i notice a few things
i like the appearance of the panasonic model over the sony model
i just feel that the panasonic model looks nicer
in terms of when im holding both radios in my hands the sony model seems to have a better build quality harder plastic less flimsy feel to the radio
however ive had the panasonic model for a while and have had no issues with its build quality
of course im very careful with my electronics i dont abuse them
both models seem about equal in terms of receiving fm signal
both models pull in the local stations quite easily
the sony model seems to have a slight advantage in pulling in the slightly weaker stations but this could be due in part to the fact that its antenna is longer
am reception on the sony is much better than the panasonic
it seems to be able to pull in the stations with more clarity
but again the panasonic radio can pull in the strong local am stations just fine
to my ears both of these models sound exactly the same
sound quality of musictalk shows sound the same with both unitsnote  people should note that the headphone jack on both of these models are in mono only
this means that when you plug stereo headphones in either model youll only get sound in one side of the headphones
please bear in mind that this does not mean the radio is broken
these units were designed this waythe bottom line  i definitely consider the panasonic rfp a steal at ten bucks
its a small sized radio that you can carry with you anywhere to listen to music or get the latest news
both the sony and panasonic models are what i consider to be excellent deals
i prefer the panasonic over the sony model thoughfor most cases id recommend the panasonic model
but if youre looking for slightly better build quality and better am reception then id recommend the sony model
of course get the sony model if you prefer its appearance over the panasonic modeli got this radio for someone and the person found it really useful
had a lot of value for the personi like the size sound performance butit tips over too easy
if youre going to keep it laying flat or in a pocket or something fine but its end face is not stable enough to suit me
basically the same thing as the sony of similar design but the sony is a bit larger and thus more stable sitting on a hard surface on its endthis little radio is great for its intended purpose
looks old schoolish has an ear phone jack dial tunervolume
received  stars because it could have better range but that often has more to do with the stationinexpensive  important to have in times if emergency  in todays world who knows
i am host i bought it to complete his kit
he fells safe with it  ultimately that is what countsthis is exactly what you think
it is very light and is perfect to listen to an announcer while sitting at a game
i use it in dc for redskin games and it picks up channels well although i do need to have the antenna fully extendedsummaryit is a terrific transistor radio
turn it on dial in your station enjoy memories of a simpler timeparticularly these days when you cant set the time on a typical wristwatch without the manual which you lost three years ago
onoffvolume with plenty of volume if you want it
great manual tuningthe radio wont forget your station when you change batteries
there is even a little red diode which helps tuning in exactly on your station
two aa batteries seem to last forevertuning and receptionthe manual tuning is straightforward and easy albeit sometimes it is hard to exactly tune in a weak station near a strong one in part because a slight touch of the dial changes the frequency
there are no presetsso if you listen to several stations write the frequences down on a label and stick it to the radio and protect the label with clear tape
just dial in the station you want
reception is usually very good even without the telescoping antenna just leave it collapsed but it is very much appreciated when you need itonoff volumeone of the particularly good features of the panasonic is plenty of volume
you can place the radio anywhere in the room
i consider it to be a shop and patio radiosound qualitythe sound qualtiy is good not great
this is a radio for listening to news talk radio or ball games not classical music
music is acceptable particularly at modest volume
if you want to listen to music buy an mp player with a builtin fm reciever and a good set of headphonesor a fancy bose etc for  times the pricebatteriesthe panasonic uses two aa batteries which last forever
honestat least a month using the radio several hours per dayeven with rechargeables
nevertheless having a set of  rechargeables means you are never out of batteriessanyo eneloop  pack aa nimh precharged rechargable batteries w chargerusing headphonesthe headphone earphone in transistor days is mono and no earphone is included mono or otherwise
which means you have to plug in your stereo headphonesbut then you only get sound to your left ear nothing to your right ear
why
ive had mono voice recorders for years which nevertheless had the proper socket for stereo headphones you got mono but to both ears which was fine
if you want an am radio to use with headphones i suggest a coby cxwhich is also mono but to both earscoby cx compact amfm radio with digital display silvercarrying it aroundthe panasonic is nicely pocketsized and slides easily in and out of shirt pockets
its a bit large for pants pockets
the strap is rather useless and cant be removed
there is no easy way to carry it on your belt
ive placed a strip of selfadheasive velco tape on the back and mating velcro tape the several places i use it eg in my shop and on my hammockvelcro stickyback hook  loop fastener roll in dispenser box in x  ft black vekother funcionsthere are no other functions
if you want travelalarm clockradio i again suggest a coby cxcoby cx compact amfm radio with digital display silveri happily use both radiosi love this little radio to listen to myoakland as baseball games on like right now
i had to scout around to find it now that spring training games have startedpretty good little radio
reception could be a little better but that just might be my rural location
i got a couple of these for emergencies and keep  in my inch bagi like size construction sensitivityi do not like dial knob for volume and tuningwith a month of using the power key is failing to turn oni got this secondhand from a friend and i know for a fact it was bought in the mid s
amazing that its still being sold
rather a simple product sucks up a butload of power mono sound the sound is kind of weird sounding on music but its probably the sheer age of the thing
if its lasted  years with little care given to it i think its a good buyaudio quality is fairly good  about the best you could expect for a relatively low priced recorder
the case seems to be made of cheap plastic and the raised lettering on the front of the machine have sharp edges which reinforces my view that this is not a high quality recorder
ignoring the quality of the casing the machine is still rated a good buy based on its solid performancethe cassette player was larger than described
its not around the same size as two cassettes
it does work very good
does not eat up the cassettes
its a trusted company
there is no led light for when the battery gets low
the ac outlet is very handy less trouble than a large bulky adapter
the sound is very good
records well and when in the ff or rewind modes also play mode the cassette shuts off
this comes in very handygood unit but i dont really like the sound
im using it only for voice and durability of the player is important for me
it appears to be a well made unitweve only used this as a tape player havent tried to record but it works great
our old tape player wouldnt play louder than a whisper but this one has no issue playing at a normal volume
it does not have a usb output which would be nice but i do like the fact that it has a loudspeakerreview for  panasonic rq cassette recorderworks great all functions work just as one would expectbe sure to check all functions right after you get it so you can exchange it easily if you need toobviously not as high end as the higher end audio cassette recorders

family members doctor records everything on cassette so it can be shared with the rest of the family and after visiting  different national stores and not finding a machine like this we came to the zon and found this
seems to work well
next time you hit a garage sale and see one of these working for a buck grab it and throw it in the closet because somebody will need it down the roadif you are lucky enough to have a trg pro like me or the new handera  this modem works fine in the flash slots of those devices as well palm os
on the trgpro you may run into some battery problems it seems to drain them rather quickly so be sure to have spares on hand and dont stay online too long
the increased battery life on the handera deals nicely with this problemwhen youre buying a modem for a pocket computer youre probably not interested in bells and whistles you want something thats as small and as reliable as possible that will let you connect to the internet and check  your email or surf the webthe pretec modem fits that need perfectly
theres no flashing leds no driver discs the box contains nothing but the  tiny modem a phone cord and a brief instruction manual
theres not even  an aol disc
they must be slipping
i was able to get connected in less  than ten minutes without touching the instruction manual
just slip the  modem into the slot plug in the phone cord set up a few basic connection  settings and youre off and running
if your isp supports windows dialup  networking it will very probably support thisthe manual is the weak  spot the installation settings it describes on page  and  may well not  match up with those needed
since the dialogs used to configure the pocket  pc are quite similar to the dialogs used to set up windows dialup  networking youll want to have your isps setup instructions  availablein conclusion this product is certainly more than worthwhile  it gives you fullfeatured dialup capabilities in only a few cubic inches  of spaceone final caveat  this product is also known as the  quotpocket pc email expansion packquot
if youve just purchased a  pocket pc you may find that theres a special offer included for this  expansion pack and youll want to check out that offers pricing and terms  before deciding where to buyi bought this fine product right after i bought my pocket pc
it plugged right in and i dialed up my earthlink account with no problem
i dont think it could have been easier
the only thing is i have only used it  or  times
whats the point
pocket ie works well but the view is way to small
its cool to be able to pull up web pages on your pocket pc but it looses its coolness pretty quick
now a wireless modem would be useful but they are a lot more expensive and have additional monthly feesit is goodi bought one set to check them out and found they also fit both my four and  year old kids
then i bought  more sets just for them as an alternative to the in the ear phones thatfor them can be uncomfortable
they reproduce sound well fit comfortably and have held up well from constant use
the cord is long if thats important to you the headband not too tight and is adjustable and the felt covers on the earpieces are thin but comfortableand also thank you amazoncom
the convenience of ordering  more sets was but a couple of mouseclicks and the earphones were at my door in  daysthese are a good value for the money
they dont have superhigh sound quality  but its very acceptable
for audiobooks they cant be beatel desempentildeo de estos audiacutefonos es mejor de lo que aparenta

los uso durante mi ida y estadiacutea en la oficina o cuando voy de viaje para no perderme el placer de oiacuter mi muacutesica preferida
considerando su precio y calidad de sonido son altamente recomendablesthe performance of these headphones is better than it appears
it has good bass reproduction while its performance in the midrange and treble is arguably acceptable
i use them during my trip stay in the office or when i travel not to miss the pleasure of hearing my favorite music
considering its price and sound quality are highly recommendedat an affordable price its good to hear the base sound and clarity
adjustable and indeed lightweight
i would recommend this productthese are the best portable headphones in this price range
i have a couple of these and then bought some for my mother who asked me to buy another one
it seems like some stores just do not carry many or any of these type of headphones and push the ear bud type of headphones
i dont like the ear buds as they seem to hurt my ears and are always falling outthese are the better working ones in this price range  and free shippingthe sound is decent and i dont need state of the art headphones just to listen to some music
these headphones provide that with minimal cost
of course you are not going to get excellent high quality sounding headphones when you pay  and try finding these type of headphones
seen similar pairs for  inexpensive i am not an audiophile and dont need anything fancy
comfortable my main requirement
sound through the ear pieces is suitable for my usesi remember these from the s  still good for casual listening light enough for activewear and well built so it should hold up to daily use
decent sound quality rolled off bass and high end but also good for checking your mix against a normal set of headphones
will buy againi will put this bluntly i bought these for a pair of kids i was baby sitting to break instead of my good headphones
they are not hugely fantastic and amazing quality
however they are good enough
you do not want these for moving around a lot with
they are good enough for use with laptops in the car or laying down
the sound quality surprised me but i also didnt expect much
it actually sounds decent and the bass is goodoverallgood for the price of it
if you want a pair that can be a little beat up or chewed on without crying over it these are itnot recommended for the gym jogging or anything high movementgood for just about anything elsethese headphones were only 
the sound quality was good for that price
not great but good enoughbroke after a few months
i cant expect too much from an inexpensive product
these are good for those who hate earbudsmy kids use these with their mp players
they are lightweight enough for them to keep on their heads wout being bulky and they can hear their music wout the volume being up too loudthis is my second pair
the first lasted couple years and i use them everyday for listening on computer
the sound is clear and legible
has bass treble and all that
cant go wrong with thesei used to buy expensive brands that cost x more and they arent worth it because they all break eventuallythese headphones were low priced and they are ok for the price
i should have spent more
its my faultthese sound good and theyre fairly comfortable cant wear them for hours though
theyre the best cheapy headphones out thereoverall a deep rich yet discrete sound with a larger driver set
need equalizer to truly appreciate
cant be beat at this price pointthese work well for casual listening
the sound is decent
for the money they are a good value
no issuesthey are comfortable have a nice length cord and sound good
i was just looking for something i could use with either my computer or listening to music on my phone at work and these are perfect for my needsi bought this as a gift and the recipient using it on a kindle said it worked great
the price was very rightfor the price i cant go wrong
great for the kids to use on tripsno problems yeti bought a roku  because i could use headphones with it if i wanted to stay up late to watch a movie
these are more than adequate for the price and work perfectly
i am happy with my purchasethese are not highend these are not hightech and these are not highperformanceas a lowpriced actasyouexpect headset for an ipod or or other audio device you cannot go wronggiven the inexpensive price tag if it wasnt a panasonic product id have arched an eyebrow in anticipation of low qualityid have been wrong on any account
these work as desired and expected
recommendedi would have given this pair of headphones five stars if it were not for the fact that five stars is hard to give for an audio product that costs less in some cases than a value mealthat said this is definitely the best cheap pair of headphones i have ever owned
the sound is great given the price point
well see about the lastability but this is a great little product and if youre looking for an everyday portable decent sound quality pair of phones  look no further
these are it
buy them
they really do sound very good for what they arethe sound quality could be much better on these but i bought them for my kids for technology class at school and their leapsters
they dont notice so they fulfill the need i bought them for
if you want great sound  headphones arent for you but if you just need a cheap pair for the kids
these will definitely do the jobmuch better bass compared to smaller drive earphone
i wish that the head band has less pressure on ear
not sure if this will reduce the quality of sound
the wire length is longer than my other headphones i like itpaid  for these headphones didnt expect much
but they are attractive decent sounding and packaged nicely
as such they will make nice stocking stuffers
give everyone around you a set and enjoy some peace and quiet
ive used mine for a couple months now and they still worki use them for exercise and walking so i bought them knowing i would be sweating and did not want to use an expensive pare and am surprise at the good sound for the pricethe panasonic rpht lightweight headphones with xbs port are very lightweight
they sound ok and make a good lightweight bedtime headphone
they are so lightweight they slip off my head if i try to wear them during normal daytime activity
the xbs port is very useful as an extra xbs port
my xbs  really needed an extra port
now i can xbs wherever i wanti am  years old and a music lover at heart
i go through at least  pairs of headphones a year they never leave my neck
i listen to music at all times accept in school of course
i prefer headphones that increase the bass and cancel sound around you noisecanceling
these headphones are perfect meaning that you can really hear the bass and not much else around you
the vocals are really good and the sound comes through very clearly
i have had them for a month so far and they havent disappointed me
the only thing is that they are made pretty big and even the lowest setting is really long
i would not recommend them for running ive tried and they have fallen off
i would stick to earbuds
but for dancing around the house working or on a long car ride these headphones are definitely worth more then the price they are asking for
i am very impressed with the price it was great to find a good pair of headphones under  and the sound quality overallgreat price for the budget heaphone
my little kids use it to listen to their ipods
no issues as of yet and seems to work just finethese work well for listening to videos at night when everyone is asleep
they are comfortable and the price is righti had another pair of headphones but in summer my ears would get very sweaty if i wear them and i hate the ones that you plug in your ears because they hurt after a while in my case
i bought this and they work just fine and the price is righti am very impressed with these headphones for many reasons and i will go ahead and generalize my reviewfor the common consumer
im going to be using a rating system of  lowest and  being the highest
thereview will discuss comfort durability burnin before and after  soundcomfort rating as a person who wears glasses and having a big sized head these are very comfortable for the price
myonly concern is that i have long hair and my hair tends to get tangled between the clip selectionssettingsi use mine on click numbersetting four and this gives you an idea of how above average my head is
if youhave short hair and a small head then these are perfect you but once you run into the category of havingglasses and an above average head with long hair then problems may appear that negates the comfort of theseheadphonesdurability rating opening the package i can already feel the cheap plastic of these headphones
i had to be very careful wheni was opening the product to prevent a break in the chord or the cheap plastic parts
after the puzzleof removing them from the packaging and two months of use i am impressed as to how long they have heldgranted i use them only on my laptop during the evening or at night before i go to sleep these have heldvery well
i do not use them for exercising nor do i use them for walking around the house or outsidei have been strictly using them while sitting down in bed or at my home officeburninthis has no particular rating because sound is all based on personal exposure and taste
as mentioned i havebeen using these headphones for two months which has resulted in a good amount of use
the sound remains thesame in my opinion
no difference in my experience with out of box stock use to burn in usesound rating i own several headphones and i will post a few headphones in my arsenal at the end of the review but firstlets get to the main event of these headphones
sound i was impressed with these headphones when i pluggedthem into my hacked nd generation ipod using rockbox and playing flac files
i will say for  dollars the soundis slightly above average i will not say great or amazingits manageabletreble the highs are bright but it lacks clarity
you can hear the treble in the music but thats just ittoo much treble without clarity is pointless
yes the treble and the mids are there but where are the detailsits great to hear a guitar distorted for rock grunge or poprock however the details are just not thereor more like forgotten
example i was listening to no doubts dont speak and the whole song soundedgreat rhythmically speaking yet pay attention to the leadyou can hear it but its not as balanced withthe rest of the song
it seems that if the headphones start to reach a peak for the lead guitar the soundbecomes strainedbass for  or less i cannot find another pair of headphones that will give you the bass that theseheadphones will give to you
i am satisfied with the bass and have yet to find another pair of headphonesthat can carry this much bass for this price
if i had to rate the bass id give it a  rating largelydue to the punch it packs for its price rangemy headphone arsenalkoss porta prossony mdrvsony mdrexlpsony xbaklipsch spanasonic rphtkoss kscfavorite headphones tossupkoss portapro or sony mdrexlpit all depends on my mood of whether i feel like having an in ear headphone or over the ear
i favor bothvery much the same in terms of sound comfort and durabilityi just wanted a pair of headphones i could use on my laptop and kindle and on airplanes
considering that i  paid less than  for these headphones they are good value for money
the frequency range seems adequate for listening to classical music and the bass was better than i expectedi bought these to fit a portable cd player
the ear phones worked just fine
it was the cd player that took the lick
i mean for the price i was just glad they workedi wanted some headphones for my girls to use with the computer or dsi they arent fond of the earbud types which were all i had lying around from my mp devices so i purchased thesetheyve held up well as theyve been used regularly for over a year
the sound quality and fit around the ear are both nothing special as sound leaks out through them as they dont have a tight fit as designedhowever they get the job done as a cheap set of extra headphones just to have lying around the house
im impressed with the durability given the priceoverall quality for the money is outstanding but overall quality is only sosothese are great headphones for the price
recommend that you pick a set up
my daughter is using them to practice her piano
i tried them out and did not know if the sound was from them or in the room
they sounded that good
i had to take them off to realize that the room did not have the sound it was just the headphonesthese are the best portable headphones in this price range
good bass and smooth natural sound
in fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price
if you can afford more consider the sennheiser px for about  dollars
but if youre on a budget or dont want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones these are definitely the ones to getthese are lightweight soft and comfortable on the ears and easy to use
they are also adjustable and come with a long enough cord
i doubt they would block out airport noise but i bought them to use at homei bought these headphones because i kept on misplacing or breaking my expensive ones
for the price you pay the product is great
the sound quality is good and its no big deal if you break it because its so inexpensive
the one thing i dont like about these is that sometimes your hair will get stuck on the frame
when you try to take it off it will also take a piece of hair with itthese inexpensive headphones are a very good deal
they are comfortable and the sound quality is clear but with one caution they dont produce much volume
i have to turn the volume up pretty high on my devices to get them loud enoughmy kids broke yet another set of headphones so i pulled these out of the closet
the sound is fantastic but they appear to be made for a babys headthey were insanely tight
every time i use them i bend the head band and theyre finally getting comfortable but only barelyif these headphones could have slightly bigger pads and a comfortable fit theyd be perfect the earphones are fairly comfortable and are adjustable for those with different sized heads
the foam padding over the earbuds make a functional cushion for the ear
when i use these earphones it is usually to watch hulucom tv from my computer
i have the volume on my computer turned to medium and low
on this setting other people in the room cannot hear what i am listening to
it serves its purpose
i recommend the earbuds
its a good deal for someone who is looking for something practical
just make sure your speakers that you plug these phone into have a trs connector  audio jack plug otherwise you cant use these for your computer  as far as i can tella decent sound definitely not the best but very decent for the moneythese headphones are great for the price
lack a bit in the highs and lows but thats not what i purchased these for
have grandkids and great grandkids and inexpensive headphones to keep around the house for their use is tough
these are ideal they work great for me for my audio books and since my hearing isnt as sensitive as it once was the sound is fine for my musicif one of the younuns breaks a set of these im not out of a large amount of cashthese function fairly well
i use it to listen to mps when i am at work but im surprised at the description and some of the reviews which say this has enhanced bass response
in fact i found the treble response to be good and not the bass
i normally have the eq settings for typical classic rock  a distended v which should enhance the bass but i didnt see the enhanced bassthe other shortcoming was the length of the cord
i had to buy an extender so i could comfortably move around on my chair in my cube at work when connected to the pcanyway i am happy with it but the cost was doubled when i bought the extenderthis set of headphones is surprisingly good
i use it during workouts and the quality of music coming out is really goodfor such a cheap little thing bass sounds good
it seems to me that the overall volume is not so strong but maybe its with all headphones
for the price its a good buyi like these headphones but for mobile  they are not sensitive enough
they have sensitivity db which is not enough other phones i have with db sensitivity  are ok with mobiles
sound quality is ok but nothing special but for this price they are great
these phones do not provide good isolation which is ok for me when im on bicycle and need to hear outside sounds but for public transport and other noisy places they are uselessfor the price is a very good headphone
it is not a bose but is good for normal use
i like itif you are willing to expend  or  dollars buy bosesound is good given the low pricethe cord is ridiculously longi initially bought this for my  year to use
i figured for the low cost i could easily replace this when he breaks it
works great but the cord is so long that he keeps tripping over it
i got past that by using a twist tie to hold the cord together but then found out that his th percentile sized head is just a bit too small and the headphones keep slipping off
so i went with a dedicated childs headphone insteadthey are lightweight and the sound is good
since the actual ear pieces are convex and do not fit to the ear they can slide off a little too easilyi have an old pair of xbs headphones that came w a portable cd player
ive always liked their full sound so when i changed over to an mp player it was no surprise that i found them to sound the best for that format too
i am one of those people that cant keep earbuds in my ears they always fall out andor dont sit right in my ear and sound tinny
anyway as the old ones are beginning to wear out i found these new ones and decided to purchase
they have the same full rich sound as my old ones and at a price that makes them disposable anymore
my one complaint is they are using thinner foam that decreases their comfort level somewhat
overall i highly recommend themi was skeptical about these headphones
im use to the big bulky kind and the little ear plugs
i hate the ear plugs but traveling on a bus or walking down the street with an mp and the big ones isnt exactly any better
these arethey are lightweight and have an awesome sound quality
i couldnt believe i could have my volume on the lowest setting on my laptop and it still be too loud
another reviewer mentioned the bass
it is astounding
i was so use to my big and bulky and old ones for laptop listening and with these new ones im hearing the music in such a better waythe only slight issue i have with them is i find myself fidgeting with their placement on my head
its not a big or constant deal and maybe it will go away the more i wear them
ive owned them for a month now
its as if they feel too light or they move easier than the big ones do since they dont cup around your earall in all i still highly recommend themi bought these headphones for my kids portable dvd players they were smaller in nature and inexpensive so i thought them to be a perfect fit
the fit is good for my six year old but not so much for my three year old
they were inexpensive so i didnt expect much out of them but they have pretty good sound
i only wish they had cupped ear covers so that they would stay on better in the back seat but for this price you really cant complaini gave these to my spouse primarily for the tv and so the audio doesnt really need to be top notch i have no idea exactly how good these are in that respect
he seems pleased with them but frankly as they are a gift he isnt likely to say anything badthe headphones do the job
now that i have a new laptop with louder sound i dont need them as muchthese  head sets i bought for car use
for the price it works well
i do not worry about freq
children do not eather
they are better then some i paid moor fori bought these headphones from amazon mostly because of the extensive positive reviews
that and at only  they seemed like a bargain
make sure you combine them with an order over  to get the free shipping
otherwise with shipping included they are not worth it
the headphones seem very well made and comfortable
they also seem to have a very clear sound with good stereo separation
my only negative with them is their volume level is quite a bit lower than the output of your source
that is i had to turn the volume up considerably to hear the headphones at medium volume
when i unplugged the phones the speakers came on and were extremely loud
other than the somewhat wimpy volume of them they seem a worthwhile investmentlight and comfortable with reasonable fidelity
the only knock i have on these is the foam they used to cover the ear pieces
they seem to deteriorate a lot faster than than any thing elseenough bass to make it sound fine
just a little uncomfortable to wear but you will get used to it
great sound for a few bucksthese have wonderful sound and the price is pretty great too
i run through a lot of  these headphones and found that i run through them just as fast whether they cost much or not so have decided to just stock on the cheaper ones
i bought some sony ones at the same time i got these that were around same price and i think the sound is better on these
my husband advised me to stock up on these since they would probably quit making them as soon as everyone got hooked on them
sound advice indeedprice was goodhas the xtra bass as it saysover all sound slightly muffled as i expected in this price rangei use them on the go and a lil at home onlythey light weight is greatthey are pretty comfortablenot recommended for smaller heads as i use them almost fully adjusted to smallim a grown guy with a average size headlolthey do slip some n would be horrible for joggingetci can wear them about a hr with out fatiguethen i just rub my ears n wait  minutesno biggiethe cord is extra long and can be a good thingbut kinda a pain on the gojust a little extra looping around belt loopsthey work fine
the sound is good
i find them more comfortable than ear plugs for long time use
of course they are bulkier than ear plugs
they are light weight and have very good sound
the sound is not as good as the expensive earmuff kind but for what they are they are good imhothese headphones produce excellent sound particularly when one considers their moderate price
my wife has used a set of these for a couple of years and likes them because they are lightweight and feel comfortable to her
she recently broke the headband which i was able to repair so i bought another pair as a backupi used a different set of these same phones myself for several months some time ago
i listen to audio on my ipod while i walk laps on an indoor track and i found the sound to be very pleasing to me
however it turned out that the foam cushions on the headphones were slightly rough
these pads irritated the skin on my ears just enough after long heavy usage that i gave them away and replaced them with earpodsi would recommend these headphones to a friend whose ears dont stick out as far as mine doconsidering the price the sound quality is excellent
i was impressed
the ear pads are a little hard but i can live with that well worth the investmenti have and have had a lot of great headphones  but most of my headphone listening is to audiobooks and these are just perfect
dont get me wrong  they are ok for music but not great and would never be my first choice for beethovens th symphony  but considering their price theyre not badthe voice quality for audiobooks is crisp and clean and you can still hear whats going on around you very little isolation
they are also comfortable and i have worn them for over two hours at a timedid i mention that they are cheap
i have a pair in the bedroom one in a travel bag and a spare for when one of my cats decides to chew on another pairs wiresyou will not be disappointedfor the price you cannot get better headphones
earbuds hurt my ears so i wanted a headband style pair that sat on the outside of my ears
i chose the panasonic rpht lightweight headphones with xbs port because of the price  and because there were so many great reviews
normally i shy away from super cheap deals because you usually get what you pay for ie cheap deal  cheap product
not so with these headphones
they are lightweight with a very decent sound and are extremely comfortable
i had no problems wearing these on a  hour flight
my ears never hurt once and i hardly noticed the headband
plus if i do every lose or break them i wont be upset because of the price
but they seem very durable and survived a round trip flight and being shoved in my backpack
theyve already been used well more than  worth so i feel like its money well spent
if you need a great set of headphones at a reasonable price then definitely get theselove watching and listening to youtub online the headphones early in the morning  head phones make it possible while my wife sleepsi am no audiophile and i am came to these after my  singlesided cord jwin headphones started giving trouble after  yrs
wish i could have told you which model but it has worn ofafter listening to these on my laptop for a couple of hours i have to say that out of the box the mid to high frequencies are boosted way too much for my liking vocals and percussion stand out and overpower the bass
i have used the equalizer in winamp to reduce the harshness of the frequencies a bit and it sounds betterthat being said audio source has a big part to play so i cant say how these will sound on a portable audio device with limited equalizer abilitiesother things to note are that its kinda smallmm driver its very light and cables are kinda thinbottom line for  bucksyou would be hard pressed to find betterbut if you need better i would advise anything with at least mm drivers that cost at least  dollars with a singlesided cordhusband is very pleased with theseand surprised
wasnt expecting these to be so good
was exactly what he wanted for his need
inexpensive but so worth it
lightweight sound quality is very very good
hes a happy mangood price for this headphone
seems fragile
xbs port is new to me
sony should explain it in the description what this port do to enhance this headphone
of course one could google xbs porti like it
i just receive it and i am listen music with it right now the sound is really good
they are so nice and confortable but i didnt give it  because it is a little bit bigger for me and i cannot tight it more since is the maximum
but i think it is my problem since i am a tiny person it just would be better if i could tight it more on my head
otherwise i love ithere are the specifications for the panasonic rpht headphonesdriver units  mmimpedance   ohmssensitivity   dbmwpower handling capacity   mw iecfrequency response   hz   khzcord   m  ftplug   mmthese headphones are unusually comfortable and youll be amazed at the beautiful and accurate sound they produceone thing to be aware of  these headphones dont get particularly loud
if youre looking for something to use with an mp player or an ipod its usually best to buy headphones or earbuds that have a sensitivity level of at least  dbmw
the sony mdrelp earbuds are a cheap energyefficient halfwaycomfortable and decentsounding alternativeits pretty unbelievable at first but these inexpensive headphones really give you quite a bit of use for your money
they connect easily to mp players and similar devices and the bass is awesome just as everyone says it is
moreover at this price you simply cant go wrongif you listen to a cd or mp player daily i would recommend buying a few sets of these
they do go south eventually and you wont have to worry about waiting for another pair to shipthese are also much much better than earbud headphones the earbuds always make my ears hurt
the over the head strap is fairly comfortable and that alone makes this a much better choice than the earbud type of headphonesin addition use these for young kids who may not be all that gentle with them
that way if they break or get lost you wont be out too much moneyi highly recommend these headphones they may not be the very best out there after all theyre not sennheiser skull candy hesh headphones or skullcrushers but the sound quality is really quite good and you cant beat the price
you wont be too upset if these break or get lost eitherthe best low cost headphones i can find
the sound quality is decent but it is not very mechanically rugged
this is my second one as the first one broke at the sliding adjustment band after a few years of use while exercising
but at this price i can afford to replace it every two yearsive had ear phones be for so i know how nice they can be
i also know that they become uncomfortable after wearing them for a while
the rph are pretty nice for the money i spent
great sound  i forgot how nice they can be
im listening to the holiday cd by hans zimmer now using the earphones  awesome
i am getting older and have to admit that my hearing isnt what it used to be
the earphones bring quality to sound that i have not had for quite a while
very clear good right left sound separation when the source has that and great low sound range that i really didnt expect
yea they are a little uncomfortable after you wear them for a while but the beautiful sound outweighs that aspect
compared to the older earphones i used to have the rphs are much lighter and much more comfortablemy son tears things up so i wanted to get him some headphones that were decent but that if he ruined them in a few months i wouldnt mind too terribly much
these were cheap
but all in all they arent badhe had no complaints about the sound quality not that he really cares all that much but he said sometimes they get a little staticy and he has to wiggle the cordfor the cost of these they are well worth it if you like me have a kiddo who tends to break things or not take great care of stuff and you want to test them out on a cheap item before you spend too much money
this is a good choicei absolutely love the fact that its a cheap and affordable set of headphones but thats exactly how theyre made  cheaply
i would go through about  of these a year due to the fact that they break too easily even if you drop it on the carpet
plus if you accidentally snag the wire while wearing it youre more than likely going to break the part where you adjust them to fit over your headi have to admit even though the wire is pretty short an audio extender did the trick the bass is incredible
theyre not exactly like the noise cancelling type but its very comfortable while wearing them i use it mainly for my ipod and pci have tried other headphones in the past but since i tend to wear them for several hours a day they start to hurt my ears after a while
ive never had a problem with thesei highly recommend this if youre on a limited budget and looking for an inexpensive set of headphonesfor less than  these headphones are very good quality
theyre very light and produce clear sounds
however as you can probably guess from the size they wont go as high a volume without distortion or give you much bass
i bought these because during summer wearing my overtheear headphones can get a little stuffy on the computer and i wanted light headphones that feel like im not wearing themso far these feel great and light enough that i almost feel like im not wearing any headphones
also they have not caused any discomfort to my ears after  hours of constant use
they stay on the ears very well and will not fall off even when i shake my head hardi give  for comfort
i feel the cushion on these headphones should be a little thicker on the edges because the plastic edges can be felt on the ears and is not as comfortable as id like italso the sound gets  because its easily distorted with high volume volume doesnt go high enough in some applications and although the bass is present its weaki purchased this for my mom for tv use but what a wonderful surprise it is
let me explaini have had many headphones for years from highend grados to mid and lowend sennheisers
full or compactsize and earbuds you name it i have owned them allthis panasonic rpht has a similar sound signature to panasonic rphtx a very fashionable pair that cost  times more
the sound stage is quite good and its bass response mimic what i hear from my grados
the midrange is as smooth if not smoother than sennheisers px
the one point deduction comes from the highpitch sound where it just broke apart
other than that it is hard to believe that a fivebuck headphone can sound this decentif radiotv use is your primary reason when selecting headphones look no furtherif you want a casual music listen experience this will be a serious content
imho this has all sennheisers excluding earbuds px and hd series headphones beat below dollar rangeas long as its build quality all cheap plastic mind you holds up this gotta be the king of all budget headphones when cost and sound quality are put into equationone minor note though the all plastic headband snatches my hair when adjusting
i rarely get this kind of treatment from other cansin the end you cannot lose buying this little guy and you could be pleasantly surprised as i have beeni wanted a set of cheap headphones for gaming when the wifes asleep
these fit the bill
less than  from amazon
dont expect great fidelity for so little money
but i have zero complaints about these little headphones
satisfiedi must say that these are pretty good for the money
they are not as good as the sennheiser s they are replacing but for a cost that is  of those these are just fine for the gym
they are perfectly acceptable for working out but a few things i noticed are as folows not as loud as senneheiser  these just barely get loud enough on quiet songs for my ipod nano
not as comfortable  these are not uncomfortable everyones head is different  right
 but feel a little harder on the ears and the head band is scratchy when you put around your neck
these are brighter less warmth and bass response  but sound is pretty accurate overall and tweaking the eq helps someoverall these are a great deal for active people who need a cheap set of headphones
i would not give it  stars if it was more expensive but value is part of the equation here
i still have my nice headphones for use at home but i spent less than  on these so very happy overalli only spent  for this pair of headphones and they work very well
doesnt put out bass boosting sound but i can listen to my music well enough with these headphones
havent had any real major problems with it and it continues to work like the day i bought themi was a little dubious after reading several negative reviews about the plug in to an iphone or ipod
the first time i plugged it in to my iphone the sound started strong then slowly faded
i discovered that the plug was not making a good connection to the phone
after fiddling with it for a few minutes i got it to consistently work adequately
i was impressed by the fullness of the sound and the bass response
i also like the over the head model of earphones as they dont fall off like the in ear styles do
for the price even if they only last a couple months i feel ive gotten my moneys worth
id reccomend them for someone who isnt an audiophile and just needs a basic set of over the head earphonesbought three pairs of these to replace the cheap headphones that came with a portable dvd player and horrible ear buds for my i pod
very surprised as these dont look or sound cheap like dollar store headphones
these made a huge difference and increased the volume output from the cheap dvd headphones
i compared these to my  german made akg portable headphones and although these dont have the same quality bass they sound very crisp and clear
i use these when i dont want to risk losing my expensive pair i paid almost x more for
very soft comfortable on the ears and i read they are discontinued by panasonic so i would buy them quickly
excellent pair of headphones for well under 
ive learned my portable device is only as good as your headphonesi was looking to purchase a few low cost headphones for computer use in my house with  children
i chose the over the ear type instead of buds because we were losing buds at the rate of  or  a week seriously between our house and our minivan av setup
i figured over the ear headphones would be harder to lose for the kids and easier for me to find since  they were bigger and  the kids did not want to be seen outside the house with these 
also losing headphones at this price point versus  ear buds is a little more tolerablesimply stated for the price point they cannot be beat
build quality was not bad at all and i would classify them as durable
in fact on the two sets i purchased i found it to be better than expected
in terms of design i think the best word to describe it could be utilitarian
the headphones are very light weight
we found the cord more than long enough to plug into the headphone port of our monitors or laptops
but if you need to run the cord a long length like to the back to a cpu under the desk you will need a simple extension such asstereo headphone extension  feet mm
the over the ear padding was more than sufficient for its purpose in my opinion
however other reviewers have remarked otherwise
the headphones are adjustable enough that they fit a wide range of heads in my house from mine to both my  and  year oldsound quality is ok  thats about it
however that was all i was looking for
for serious sound my children and i rely on better quality ear buds anywhere from the  to  rangefor the right purpose you will not be disappointed in these headphonesexcellent sound for this price
not the best  but i got it for 
including shipping
this is really what chinese headphones should sell for anyway  but dont
remember  even at this price theyre still making profits or they wouldnt sell themthis is a good product for the price offered
although many people dont use these types of headphones anymore i believe this is a good choice for use at home
i tend to have problems with the earbuds being too big or constantly falling out but these headphones are good to go when you hood them on your headit works and nice and quality of the sound is really goodbut there is no volume control
i would have a for an extra buck for thatim on my second set of these and if they are still on the market will buy them again
the headband mechanism is simple and they sit on the ears instead of cupping them really bad things happen under heavy earphone cups and even worse things happen with earbuds
i watch tv at night and dont really use them for music although considering how much of what i listen to was recorded in the  era it might not matter so im not in need of very high fidelitybesides how much fidelity do you need when you are hearing matt
be careful
review by tony as plant lady does not use earphones
only her name is on our amazon account and we now purchase everything on this one accountlow price decent sound and they last
have had phone at x the price crap out due to a bad connector or something  so if you just need it for audio books or lowfi this is the  best choicethese have about  to  the sound quality of my sennheiser hd for about  the price
of course i do miss the other  to  but for my zune hd these work well at the gym where i would look silly with my hdfor the price these headphones are a nice purchase
i tried them on several productsdifferent mp players laptop computer desktop computer and even my gps unit
the sound was very good in each instance and responsive to equalization changes made on my mp players
decent bass response with clear tones otherwise
i recommend these headphones highly for good sound and overtheear comforti bought this for my teen age son always loosing or braking his head phones
i bought  of these to have one for a spare so far the second one is still in the box and my son loves it
i notices the sound level was a little lower than my nice sony ear buds
but so far that are working goodits hard to find a pair of headphones like these now days i refuse to jam something down into my ear reduces situational awareness jams ear wax farther down into your ear etc
these have now faithfully served me well for almost  years at work and are only now starting to develop a little crackle due to the wire getting a short developing still qutie usable though
would buy againthe panasonic lightweight headphones just arrived and i have used them for a short time but it appears they will work just fine
arrive as stated and well packagednot sure why so many  star reviews
they work okay
for the price id buy them again  no question
they are cheap headphones that youd expect to get with an old walkman or hand held cd playernowhere does the description say that you must wear these over the head
my old headset which looks very similar could be worn from the back of the headneck
this means that when i go out walking or anywhere else where i want to wear a hat i cannot use this headsetas for the increased bass  i did an ab comparison with my old headset and they sounded very similar in quality overall
if the rpht has more bass my impression is that they simply attenuated the high frequencies making the bass more predominant as the maximum overall volume from the rpht is not as high as with my old headset
this means that in a noisy environment you may not be able to be able to hear itbottom line for indoor use no hats in not overly noisy environments this is a good headset especially for the pricei bought this unit because it was the lowestpriced headphone i could find with a cord long enough to plug into the front panel of my pc without continually jerking out when i move like the earphones i had been trying to use
i did not need it for enjoying music or videos i just needed it to hang on the side of my pc tower for easy access when i need to audit something i am working on late at night while the sensible people here are sleeping
it does the jobi was looking for some inexpensive head phones
my ears are too small and standard buds etc just dont fit my ears well
these are very affordable head phones
good quality
i would order more from this seller
arrived in a timely mannerthese sound very good for their price much better than my ipod earbuds
as advertised these headphones produce a lot of bass  almost too much bass
theyre pretty comfortable with earpieces that swivel slightly an adjustable headband and foam earpads
however the headband is plastic and doesnt feel very sturdy
the sound is great for  but sound pretty bad compared to my  sennheisers
you get what you pay forpros good sound for 
lots of bass
pretty comfortablecons bad sound compared to more expensive headphones
somewhat flimsy
could be too much bassi own several pair and have owned several pairs of headphones
these rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package
of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though
these headphones dont hurt your ears after a long time using them like those inear ear buds do either
i would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head
the more you sweat and move the more they slip
it is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set
bottom line  if you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphonesespecially for the money  you just cant
now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating even yard work then go with something like the philips sh inexpinsive around  that are snug
again you can not beat the panasoni rpht for the price  just be worned if you attempt to work out with themsound quality and comfort when you are relatively still seem good but not suitable for my purpose gymmuch surrounding sound is let in and you cant crank them up enough to drown it out
probably a good thing for my earsok for treadmill bike or rower but impossible for strength training  they slip around if you are not upright
edited to add that today as i am still waiting for my next try at headphones for the gym to arrive i discovered that if i push the headband back on my head as opposed to straight up they are much more stable
headband a bit large for my head even at smallest extension
on edit  barely the right size if i push them back a bit
anybody with a smaller head than mine would be out of luck
if you are going to be upright and not moving vigorously they should be fine and they sure are cheapon edit raised my rating to four stars  they are quite amazing for the price and comfortable now that ive discovered how to wear them
dont expect high volume thoughon edit including a link to another headset i ordered
am still deciding which one i like best for the gymsennheiser  hd  dynamic headphonesi wanted these for the kids to use when playing the xbox
they work great
they are lightweight have very good sound quality and are inexpensive
its a great value itemthese sound decently good for the price
dont expect these to sound like a pair of good sennheisers or kiplisch setsi have not had these very long but they are doing the job which was to carry on the plane and do other little listening jobs here and there i carry a tablet and these work very well for that i chose them mostly on the price point not the sound quality my earlier model got broken so i had to replace this is what i got i say could be better because it would be great if the ear piece would rotate enough to store more in a flat mode my earlier model did that was great for transporting is this a big issue no but is great when i have it so for the money this works at this price it is just something to listen with
i listen to electronic books so there is no need for high quality to do this i would buy these again if i break these or i would just buy whatever i found not that big of a deal for what i dowhen i received these headphones i thought they were going to sound like crap
no headphones that ive ever seen or purchased for that amount of money were good
but when i plugged them in to my mp i was surprised
they sounded goood
i couldnt believe it so i had my sister try them out
she loved them too
and she could barely believe how good and bassey they soundedespecially after i told her the price
so long story short get theseyou will be pleasantly surprised like i was
oh
the only reason why i gave them four stars is because they have a hard time staying on my head
they slide off a lot and i have a pretty good sized head
but other than that they are very good qualitybe aware that the cord is not very long  about  you may well need an extension cord to use them in many situationsfor the price theyre stupid goodnice balance light and unassuming surprisingly decent sound balance and bassno noise canceling but i wouldnt expect any from this size price and designwell worth itmy kids just wanted light comfortable headphones when listening to music on computers
sound fidelity noise cancelling etc did not matter to them
kinivo bluetooth headphones were expensive but uncomfortable behind the head and they did not want the trouble of having to charge the battery
these headphones are cheap light long cord and pretty good sound as wellthese sounded just fine for cheap headphones
they are pretty comfortable as well
if you need something cheap to take on a plane or somewhere where you dont care if you lose them then these are the headphones to getfrankly i havent used them very much
i bought them to replace some very bad headphones that came with my portable dvd player and they work very well for that purposemaybe my hearing has been damaged by too many screaming power saws but spending a lot of money on headphones is a waste for me
also in my experience price has little if anything to do with durability
i paid under  for these they have put in many many miles and when they stop working ill buy another pair
and ill be damned if something ive paid  times the price for has been remotely near even twice the qualitymy husband and i use these all the time on our ipads and we are satisfied even though they are a little large for my headmy wifes cat loves to chew through headphone cords
so my wife gets a new pair of headphones at least once a month
for under  these are great
the sound quality is actually not bad and sounds better than  other pairs of  headphones i have purchased recently
these are superior to the low end  sony models much better sound and more comfortable
cord length is acceptable for laptop and mp usehonestly if they made one of these with an inline volume control i would use it for the tv with an extension cord
i like themmuch better than my last pair and cheaper
theyre a bit tight and thus sort of give me a headache but hopefully i wear them in
really wonderful sound
didnt realize what i was missing with my last pairthe binoculars are well made
they are very easy to focus and good for viewing animals sports events  and scenery
i would recommend them to someone who needs a basic pairwe bought these for our rental property and they work fine for that purpose
if i bought another pair id go for a bit strongeri bought these to take camping and hiking with me
they are big but that was my mistake
the lenses focus very well and it helps me see animals that are farther away
i felt like i was able to get within feet of elk moose big horn sheep and bears
id buy another smaller pair to take with me hiking from the same companyi wanted these because my dad had a similar pair in the ss although this is an updated version
center focus lever works good  theyre fairly heavy compared to little pocket binocs but the image is a lot brighter so you can see more detail
the x power is good less vibration effect compared to x and xthis factoryrefurbished product is a great deal for the money
recommendedi am the pa announcer for a high school lacrosse team
these focus easily have an adequate field of vision for my purposes and let in good light when games are played after dark under the stadium lights
vision through my old pair noticeably darkened during evening games
my only complaint is that the focus control has more play in it than id like but it hasnt overly affected my ability to call games
allinall a good buy for mei expected a sold feel and they do have a quality heft to them
they are not for backpacking type hiking any long distance too bulky for that
i love the instant focus mechanism very quick and easy to use
i like also the roll down eyecups which allow using with eyeglasses left on
the soft sided case is ok and it does come with lens caps for each lens but they do fall off rather easily but that is a niti could not find these in stores so on line was the only way
i have a much older pair of bushnell and these have similar feel to themthe only negative is twice i thought the left and right lens viewed image did not line up but then i reset the focus all in or out ie near vs distance and it was ok again
so not sure if one side sticks slightly or it was my imagination  i could not get it to do the misalignment when trying but it did happen twice in about  minutes of usage
not a biggie nor enough to make me want to return themthe magnification and field of view is just right for watching birds wildlife etcnet net  easily worth  with a feel like they should last a lifetime with carethese are well priced and work fine
got them for a gift for a bird watching friend
she says they are light and are easy to adjustthis pair of glasses could readily spot the creatures that i was interested with and it was easy to teach the young uns how to use them
the images were fine for an amateur birdwatcher well defined and free of distortionwe will be cruising to alaska and these binoculars feel easy to use and it come with a case and straps
i bought it after reading all the positive reviews
after our trip i will update upon its real usei got one pair for my wife and one for me
they were such a great deal i figured we should both have one
we have them on hooks right by the front door
that way anytime we see a bird out the window we can grab the binocs and check it out
weve also brought them on a couple outings
they are easy to carry around and are of excellent qualityi bought two of these on for my self and one for my girl friend so we had something to use while we were out in the boat fishing and we could view birds or other boats on the lake to see what they were doing
my girl friend reall loves hers
she has used it to just look at diffrent things while we were on a small trip in the carwould buy againcarry mine in my fishing bag so i have it with at all timesthe reason i purchased these binoculars is because i am a hummingbird deacutevote and i like to see what birds are using my feeders
i have to be about  from the hummingbirds so as to not disturb them and being as small as they are these binoculars have worked out just rightthis bushnell x binocular will be put to good use on our vacation to beautiful alaska statei am satisfied with this purchased at amazon and i previouly owned a bushnell wide angle x binocular i have given to my nephew in the philippines still in usegreat optics nice list of options
takes great pictures
software bundle is good
problem is the battery
you get one of the  throwaways which lasts about  minutes
the rechargeable battery pack is  which is absolutely neccessary for this camera so consider the price to be  more than the going price
also the rechargeable batteries last a bit under an hour
youll also want to get a bigger memory card
using the highest resolution lowest compression takes some great pictures and youll want a big card to take lots of picturesi was a very difficult to make up my mind but finally i decided for the jornada telling the truth i really liked most jornadas design
it seems more elegant and sofisticated while ipaq seems more like a very expensive novelty toythe jornadas heavier weight gives safe feel on your hand and the rubberized edges makes you feel confortable and in control
ipaq weight and expansion pack makes you feel that your device is going to end on your feetipaq has a better display resolution
you must see both devices simultaneously and youll notice no much difference
ipaq seems easier to view outdoor but i dont have problems with my jornada if i change the display brightness to outdoor by holding one button and select quotoutdoorsquot in the hp settingswhat about the processor speed
this is one of the best features of the ipaq
jornadas mhz processor sometimes its kind of slow that considering i have multiple applications an mp playing and trying to open a document in word
nothing to worry by the momentand finally i got tired of waiting for compaq to produce one simple ipaq available for mei originally wrote this review for a jornada  but the actual unit i am  using is the  so thought id add it here as welli have been lucky  enough to have a jornada and lots of addons to try out for free
i am a  long longtime user of palms and was quite a devoted user have spent  thousands over the years upgrading my palms buying software adding  memory etc
to get the most out of them
and im here to tell youthere  is way more you can do with a palm than microsoft would have you believe
you can do more with a pocket pc out of the box than a palm yes but there  is tons more you can add on to a palm and most at a very reasonable price  than you can with the ppchaving said that the jornada is a great piece  of hardware
the color screen puts the palm to shame
it almost hurts my  eyes to look at my palm iiic now it is so pixelated and ugly in  comparison
the size is close to the palm iiic although slightly heavier
its very nice to hold sleek and pretty
my main complaint is the stylus  i find it annoyingly hard to get out and i dont like the flat shape
people are used to round pens and this one is flat
i tend to drop the  stylus and have already lost one of them as a result and came close a  second time already
would also prefer a cover that flips all the way backthe pocket pc os is much better than ce  however the inability to  close programs was a bad omission and i ended up adding gigabar a great  freeware program that closes and switches tasks among other things
but it  is a bit buggy and i would much rather that the os included that kind of  functionality from the beginning
while speed is better than older  versions i still run into things that take time where on the palm  everything happens almost instantly
there are a lot more things on the  pocket pc you will have to wait for
some addon software i looked at is so  slow as to be worthlessability to play mps is great if you even  consider carrying an mp player around
you can turn the screen off and  still listen to them which saves on batteries
in the car add the dc  adapter and it will charge your jornada while playing
you can also get  small volume boosters that will run on a single aa battery that can help  with battery life if mps are your thing
however please note that no  matter what you do listening to mps will drain the batteries very  quickly
even with the screen turned off i only get about  hours before  the batteries die on me
similar battery drains occured when doing things  like using a modem or a cf cardmore bad news
there is not much extra  software out there
compared to the palm its really really sparse
and a  lot of what is there just isnt that good or as easy to use
this is the  biggest problem i have with the unit
i just cant do some stuff i was used  to doing or in some cases it would cost me way more
some things that i  used my palm for all the time i cant do now at all
i miss wonderful  programs like datebk and handbase
so easy to use and low priced
not much  like that for ppc
i am so desperate for an easy to use and reasonably  priced database program like handbase that i may go back to my palm just  to have it
the absence of something like pocket access on the pocket pc is  a huge omission and one that must be corrected if microsoft expects  serious users to switchthe screen on the jornada is definitely a little  hard to read outside but if you use the outdoors setting it is readable  other than in totally direct sunlight
i often read books while in my car  at lunch and find it easier than my palm iiic to readi also dont like  how heavily it is tied to ms stuff
i use quickenpocket money directions  for quicken users
switch to money
thanks but no thanks
pocket quicken  on the palm does a great job for me
same with pretty much everything else
i prefer eudora for emailwith the palm i can syncon the ppc i have  to use outlook
i almost feel like it is trying to force me into using more  microsoft stuff than i already dofinally pricewise its going to  cost you more
you can now get a palm for 
yes you can expand memory  on the ppcs but it costs money
however a lot of times you are getting  more for your moneyi do believe the jornada is worth the price more than  the color palm is
but you still have to be willing to pay the priceso  what do i recommend
it really depends on what you want
if you love cool  gadgets like i do the ppc overall is a winner
i personally would probably  recommend the ipaq over the hp for the screen that is easy to read outside  better expandability and more memory for the price
if you dont expect to  need more than the cf i slot though the jornada would not be a bad  choice
if you really love everything microsoft comes out with and use  everything they make this is the one to get
if however you want more  options in terms of what you can work with and what you can do the palm is  probably the way to gobetter hand writing recognition 
mp 
better integration wms applications no surprise word excel 
better notes i use it all the time while the palm satneeds a faster cpu a little slow you really  need a compactflash if you want to listen to lots of mp i have a meg
need a way to close applications when your done
overall a great device and  i do not work for ms of hpive had my jornada for about a year now and while i dont use it all the time i at least always have it with me
it comes with fairly useful applications already on it making it very useable straight out of the box  no need to download several programs just to get it to do all the things you want it to
in fact the only other programs ive put on it have been games
with things like word excel and outlook functionality in a windows dominated work world its good to be able to drag and drop and not worry about having to figure out if youll need to convert it or download a seperate application to your pda just to view it
it also has ms money on it which i had never used before
i now use it all the time as it lets me keep track of finances and if im out shopping i dont need to call the bank to figure out how much money i can spendthe battery life is fairly good  the last time i charged it was about a week or two ago and i still have about  though i havent been using it much lately
the screen is pretty bright and i havent had a problem using it in any lighting conditionthe writing recognition is far superior to that of a palm pilot which i had before my jornada
when i took the jornada out of the box and ran through set up one of the first things i tried was to write
surprisingly after trying to do the palm pilot grafiti i was used to i found that my normal handwriting was recognizedthe jornada is pretty flexible  it does the standard emailtext documentcaluculator functionality of a pda but also offers a lot more
it can store and play mps or wmas windows media format eliminating the need for a seperate mp player
voice record is good for taking notes if you dont have the time write or catching that bit of song youd like to look up later just make sure you set the quality to one of the higher settings  the default is pretty scratchywhile the jornada is a bit heavier than most pdas these days it also makes it more durable
i am apt to throw my electronics in a purse or backpack and with my jornada its more often my backpack and the included screen cover protects it nicely
i have bent the case once when it was in my backpack without any protection and i forgot
i dropped the backpack all  pounds of it on the floor and the back of the jornada dented a bit though it hasnt affected the functionality at all and that was about six months agooverall ive been very happy with it
ive never had it lose data or freeze up it reminds me when i have to be somewhere and it keeps me from bouncing checks
all without having to add anything oni have been shopping and drooling over the current mix of pocket pc pdas for over six months now
i have struggled with the choice of the sleekness of the ipaq the sturdiness of the jornada or the hybrid casio
i realize that all of these companies make budget models that either lack color or substitute serial for usb or lack a cradle or even cut the ram in half
these models didnt interest me
as the pocket pc is microsoft based i new whatever applications i put on them would be bloated compared to the palm so a large amount of memory and a usb cable seemed a must to mei chose the jornada   the jornada has the slowest processor of the big three e  ipaq  and jornada   it also has one of the lowest color depths
for all these faults i still chose the unitmy reasons are pretty straightforward
the jornada is cheaper than the comparable casio and cheaper then the comparable ipaq
the second reason was the display
the ipaq display was gorgeous but out of my price range
the casio display was supposed to be better but in my humble opinion it stunk
this became especially clear when using the microsoft reader function were the casio letters looked purple and fuzzy versus black and crisp on the ipaq and jornada
lastly i liked the case better
the protective cover beats the casio unit and the ipaq requires an additional piece to use cf cards
sold separately of coursei have yet to see a real downside to the slower processor unless i am really multitasking
the tft display is great indoors but is inferior to the ipaq indoors
overall a great unit that beat the competition for my needsyes the ipaq has tft and mhz but costs a lot more thats why i wont put the fifth starbut with the jornada you get a compact flash slot in the chassis no extra bulk and a metal flip cover right over the screen which keeps your strokes in secret no need for an extra pouch or bag no extra bulk again so it really fits my shirt pocketnow its my mp player my palm my photo album my notebook and i do even show my own made mpegs and jpgs to my fiends at work
neat
its my working companion loaded with medicine textsbeware  cstn screen means direct sunlight wont let you see anything
 youll fill up your mb or ram very soon so many uses so be prepared to wish a mb compactflash card dont worry about buying an extra jacket or adapter its therenice looking executive class looking
ipaq looks like a toy and seems very plastic to me
this one looks slim and chickif youre looking for a pda that is designed to sync with microsoft applications on your desktop this is definitely a good buy
however you will pay for the privilege  as you can tell by shopping around the jornada  series is not at the low end of the price scale
if youve got the cash this is definitely worth itfor starters make sure you get the  instead of the  the extra  mb rom is a must
with  mb of rom youll be able to run most applications without a problem and you can have several open while still using a good portion of the memory for storage
eventually youll want to get a compactflash card  i recommend the viking  mb card
again a little expensive but youll want all the storage you can get especially if youre planning on using the jornada as an mp playerthe speaker is functional and serves its purpose but the real value is in the headphone jack
plug in the included headphones and you get your moneys worth but beware  using the jornada as a jukebox will drain the batteries so keep it plugged in if you can
the speaker does work well for reminders whether as an alarm clock or as an appointment bookthe included software is very nice  outlook  is included which makes the cost more reasonable as well as pocket excel and pocket word
pocket money also comes with it but you may have some problems synching your data if you have money  on your desktop
ive not been able to get the combination to work regularlythe interface is workable  you can use the onscreen keyboard for typing you can use singlecharacter recognition or in certain apps you can use handwriting recognition
it takes a little practice to get the strokes down but its worth the time
you can also record and play back audio notes if you preferthe size is very nice  it fits in my pocket easily and the weight helps keep it in place
it is a little heavy to hold in your hand for extended periods of time though
the stylus is held in the cover which is helpfulthe package comes with a usb cradle for synching to a desktop pc
one drawback i found was that you can only sync to pcs in the same way  for example you cant sync your contacts inbox and calendar at work and only your contacts at home
if youre just synching to one pc this is a fine arrangement
make sure you follow the installation steps exactly  i had some difficulty getting my pc to recognize the jornada at firstfinally make sure you get screen protectors with the device
as you may see in other reviews you can scratch your screen through extended use without the protectors and theyre very inexpensive
make sure to remove the green film before using themoverall i feel that ive gotten my moneys worth out of the jornada
if youre looking for a pocket pc and have the cash to spare you wont go wrong with the i used to carry a laptop and a franklin planner almost everywhere
now my jornada and the targus keyboard are all i usually need unless im doing a presentation to a client
the pocket pc is a marvel of convenience
here are common things i do on my hp jornada all ms outlook related activities appointments tasks meeting notes and contacts ms pocket money i get a receipt and i enter it before i leave the location
no more piles of receipts to process at the end of the month so that i can reconcile my accounts
 pocket word keep my personal journal jot down notes write business documents etc
the formatting isnt anywhere near as powerful as the desktop version of word but it wont take too many more features for this to be a highly functional word processor
 pocket excel track mileage
pocket excel is a very basic spreadsheet but it does a great job for simple spreadsheets
i expect future versions will be better
 download web pages for viewing using avantgo i routinely download the economist new york times cnn and many other sites
and if i travel i can download restaurant and entertainment info for the city i go to
 track billable hours using a great freeware program for pocket pc i can track billable hours for clients projects and even activities associated with projects
 brainstorm i use a mindmapping pocket pc program to brainstorm and develop mindmaps and preliminary project plans for myself and with clients
 listen to music a mb flash card can hold a decent amount of mp files
 show off my new daughter i have a digital camera so i can transfer images of my daughter to my jornada to show pictures to my friends and associatesadditionally with a pocket pc you can do many other things that i dont yet use the jornada for including view powerpoint files edit databases edit html files edit images send and receive emails view live internet watch mpg movies and make cellular phone calls
greatthe jornada really has revolutionized my life
that said there are some cons which is why i didnt give it  stars  the biggest flaw is that the screen is virtually impossible to view in sunlight
the compaq ipaqs screens are much better
 the windows os is a bit clunky
its hard to exit programs or switch between programs
i havent seen the new pocket pc  os to see if theyve improved on thisthe benefits far outweigh the flaws however
pocket pcs are a great productivity tool and the hp jornada is a great productmom asked for educational games
this one is a little advanced for them she said the occasionally have  hard time figuring out the math but they still play and get the answe with help form mum and dad
they will grow into it fully in a few months mom saysdo i spend  on a new handheld
this was the question that i asked myself before deciding to get this gem
anyone currently using a handheld will know exactly what they wantneed but it is the new user that does not know where to begin
my reason for buying the visor why buy the most expensive model now when i dont even know how much i am really going to use this thing
so why the visor over the mb palm
easy if i do use this thing a lot i can expand to mb for   did i make the right choice
absolutely
this handheld is great
so far the mb is enough and i use avantgocom to download  internet sites daily to browse on the train in the morning
this is a great first handheld for anyone
 stars instead of  are for the usb cradle instead of a standard serial cablethe visor is basically the  mb version of the visor deluxeall handspring models run variations of the palm operating system and have all of the palm functions people havecome to know and love  calendar addresses todo lists and access to a variety of downloadable programshowever the  mb of memory doesnt go far when you want to take advantage of some of the more interesting programs such as avantgo a free service thatallows you to download publications like the new york times cnn sports illustrated onto your palm for free or street maps from mapopoliscom or vindigo a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviews and showtimes
you can fit one maybe even too such problems onto your handspring
but pretty soon you are running up against that memory barrier
that would be extremely frustrating for me i have the deluxe a friend has the visor mb and recently upgraded to a higher end model in part because he wanted to add more programsif you do that in the end buying the low end model will actually cost you moneythe handspring models have the best features for the money
they have a noticeably larger screen than the m and m which ireturned after a week expandability which i have yet to use although i long for the gps attachment from magellan maybe when it goes on clearance
these models only get four stars however because they do have two significant shortcomingsone is bulk
the visor deluxe and neo are significantly larger than the palm v which is significantly more expensivethe pda still fits in my chest pocket though
i dont recommend you do thattoday mine fell out of my pocked and the screen cracked
i called handspring and they are sending me a replacement for   arghalso unlike the palm v  and  the visor deluxe and neo require new batteries after about two weeks of relatively heavyusage
that can amount to  a year or so on batteries alone
the palm v has a lithium rechargeable and the new palm has an even better battery but i cant justify paying that kind of money for what is still basically at heart anappointment calendaralso since this is the ultralow end model keep in mind that you need to have a computer to back up your data and to download features to your visor
note that the visors come with fast usb hotsyncs  which come on all new computers made in the last few years while the palm m and m come with seerial hotsyncs slower but almost every computer ever made has a serial port
palm and handspring charge you extra if you want the other type of hotsync so that my influence your decision as wellbtw i am a newspaper reporter who previously had four rolodexes on my desk
no longer
no longer do i misplace names numbers or dates
i also dont get lost as often with mapopolis at my side
this thing has changed and organized my life in ways i didnt expect  just ask my wifeits basically an extension of your brain  now isnt that worth a couple hundred smackersafter being on the waiting list at amazon for  months and also shopping  elsewhere for the com palm iiie i was plain old fed up
i wasnt willing  to spend the extravagant prices for the higher end palm pilots which seem  to be the only ones com will produce in abundance
i ran across the  handspring visor at amazon and decided to take a chance
i love it
after  comparing it to a friends palm iii i dont see a difference worth  mentioning here
it is fully compatible with the palm so why wait
the only  small pieve i have is you have to shop at amazon or handspring for  accessories andor replacement partsi purposely waited until i must be the last person in silicon valley to buy a pda  and i am glad i did
my blue visor deluxe is a great tool that has all the basic software i need bundled with it
it synchronizes  faultlessly with microsoft outlook on my pc and is great to usehowever  the synchronization software on my windows  laptop seems to be stopping  it from going into suspend mode
i tried getting email support for this  problem from handspring and they were no help at all
it looks like they  dont have time to read the email you send but just reply with a canned  response that does not address the issue
im living with that  problemthe visor palm os software has only failed on me once when i  turned it on i got a dialog box saying the system was corrupt
it then went  into a loop rebooting itself but never actually restarting
i had to do a  hard reset losing all my data to get it to work again
i have no idea why  that happened and it has not happened again
fortunately i had it backed up  to a springboard backup module and did not lose anything permanentlyi  find the graffiti handwriting input quite easy to use  although i am still  faster picking at the soft keyboard on the screenthe sync woutlook is seamless
the basic pocket mirror software syncs up your inbox outbox deleted draft and filed didnt investigate filed yet
unless you keep all the mail you need in your inbox folder you will be disappointed
the upgrade to pocket mirror promises more and who knows maybe the filed folder on the basic version holds the answeri will say that the unit is a bit slow at times which probably also explains the difficulty in convincing alarms to stop
ive found that moving the stylus over a broad area of the screen button seems to help but often that only serves to get the applications attention and you are still left to tap the button again to actually modify the alarm timespeaking of alarms the units tiny speaker is a bit weak especially when compared to my mobile phone
a bigger more powerful speaker andor perhaps a larger speaker opening would work wonders
i have all alarms set to high and struggle to hear the alarm at times
i keep the unit clipped to my belt but facing me though the unit sits quot to quot away from my body and the speaker is not obstructed by the belt clipped storage unitthis is my first pda but it wont be my last
its the perfect starter pda and has all of the palm functions people have come to know and love  addresses todo lists downloadable features like new york times front page cnn and sports illustrated
ive even put a free map of my county on my pda from mapopoliscom a must if you havent tried it
streets are searchable
also make sure you add vindigo a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviewsthe handspring also has the best features for the money
it has a bigger screen than the m which i returned after a week expandability which i have yet to use although i long for the gps attachment from magellan  maybe when it  drops to  on clearance
that said i only give the visor deluxe four stars because it does have some significant shortcomingsone is bulk
its significantly larger than the palm v which is  more and also requires new batteries after about  two weeks of relatively heavy usage
it still fits in my chest pocket though
the palm v has a lithium rechargeable and the new palm  has an even better battery but why pay  for what is still basically at heart an appointment calendarbtw i am a newspaper reporter who previously had four rolodexes on my desk
no longer
no longer do i misplace names numbers or dates
this thing has changed and organized my life in ways i didnt expect  just ask my wifeits basically an extension of your brain  now isnt that worth the unit works fine the touch screen seems not to be that responsive
if you have a via chipset in your computer
you might have to delete the driverscontrollers and reinstall espectially in win   i have found the os to be a problem already since the latest pix stuff uses   tech support was helpful but i figured out the chipset problem
construction is so so  the wireless features require additional modem and expensive
by the time you upgrade with a springboard mod  you can buy a new one
screen can scratch very easyi was issued a palm pilot at work and made a lot of use of it
i was going to buy my own one that had more memory than the mb version they gave me at work but a coworker showed me his handspring and i was in awe
i then did a lot of research and read the specs on many handheld devices handspring was the clear winneryou still get the benefit of the very popular palm os which already has literally thousands of programs available many at no or little cost and you have the ability to upgrade the pants off this thingthe springboard slot at the back means that you can pop in modules that contain memory programs or devices such as cameras phones pagers gps devices absolutely revolutionaryive had my visor deluxe for  years now and i would be lost without itmy less than perfect rating comes stems from these issues
the screen scratches badly
it looks like the same material thats used for the palm pilot so either its the screen or the handspring stylus something about the plastic surface of either the screen or the stylus will grab any bit of microscopic debris and score a heavy scratch into the screen
i still use my palm from time to time and i have no scratches other than normal use wear that looks like mild tiny scratches you can only see if you hold the palm at an angle under a light
the springboard slot should have been designed so that it inserted from the side or should have been more narrow so that the infrared beam port would not have to be on the side
this makes beaming awkward when beaming info to and from other palm users either you or the palm user has to turn the device  degrees in order to make a successful beam which means you have to read sideways
the decals or screen printed ink or whatever it is on the silver buttons rubs off
in only  months of ownership the phone and checklist buttons were blank with no icons on them very frustrating
considering greasy fingers are going to be on the buttons all the time perhaps they should have been embossed w the symbols instead if not just using more durable ink my palm does not have this problem after  years of use
mac tech support from handspring is abysmal
i had some problems getting my handspring to synch when i first got it
i struggled for several weeks
i emailed handspring and i got a number of replies that showed that not only did they not read my email but that they had poor command of the english language
i finally was able to get my handspring to synch w my mac by messing with settings on my own handspring was totally unprepared to provide support to macintosh users this gave me a really bad impression of their consumer relations department and their company philosophydespite these problems this is a fine piece of equipment that ive really found indespensible now that ive been using it for so long
i also got a targus stowaway keyboard for it also available here on amazon which was a fantastic investment in my continued enjoyment of this pda
compared to palm pilot handspring wins the contest hands downat these firesale prices the visor deluxe is a steal for folks who have missed out on the pda revolution because of the costit wasnt that long ago that this model was selling for twice the price following the latest deep discountsmake no mistake with a little patience this is a device that will change your life
after a transition period you will be able to toss away your rolodexes i used to have three and your paper calendarsfirst the two weak points and the reason why this doesnt get  stars the visor deluxe has  aaa batteries instead of a rechargeable battery
you have to replace them every couple of weeks of medium to heavy usage which can cost  a year the case is relatively bulky although it will still fit in a shirt pocketnow for the many advantagesunlike the bargainbasement palms the m and the m the handspring visor deluxe and all other handspring products have a full size screen
i returned my m a gift after a week of squintingi cant emphasize that enough
with a monochrome screen to begin with and the builtin difficulty of pointing and clicking on a palm device size mattersbtw unless handspring cuts the price of the visor neo it is not worth the extra bucks just for a faster processor
all handspring models also have an expansion slot for adding everything from memory to a cell phone to gps
you will also need the visor deluxes mb the regular visor and palm m model only come with mb if you want to run some of the cooler downloadable programs for your palm
three free programs that i use all the time are mapopolis free maps from mapopoliscom streets are searchable vindigo a restaurant and city guide with movie reviews and showtimes at vindigocom and avantgo a news service where you can get the likes of the new york times the weather channel and cnn on your palmif you want to stay with palm but can spend a few dollars more consider the palm vx
although lacking in expansion slots it comes in a superslim package with a rechargeable lithium battery and a fullsize screeni recently bought one for my wife and another for me
the vxs downside is that it comes with a slow serial cradle instead of the handsprings speedy usbi also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy expandable new m but in that price range i think a pocketpc might make more sense
heres a basic product guidepalm mhandspring visor  bargain basement models with  mb of ram

and the visor is a good vehicle to access these apps
 like the  palm
the one thing i didnt pick up in my research that may be pertinent  is that the visor requires regular battery replacements
the palm i think  starting with the v has rechargeable batteries that are juiced by the  synch cradle
i change my visors batteries every  weeks
maybe no big  deal if you have kids at home and lots of batteries but i find it a pain
is it a  pain
probably not
but i wish i had known i brought two of these with my visor deluxe and it has saved my data once already after the visors software hung on my and i had to do a hard resetthe module could not be easier to use  one click backup and  restorei was surprised though that backup and restore is quotall or  nothingquot  you cant select what to backup or restore
that means its  really only useful in the case of complete system failure when you have to  revert to a previous statethis nifty module makes backing up the visor a snap
the only reason i only gave this module four stars instead of five is that its only for disaster recovery not for backing up or restoring individual files
as long as you know this going in you wont be disappointed
if you want a module that lets you backup and restore individual files as well as add an unlimited amount of ram to your visor get a pitech memplug
the memplug lets you use either compactflash or smartmedia cards they have two models one for each format as if they were part of your hand helds own memory
get a memplug and make a palm user green with envyx is about the quality of the instant polaroid cameras  not great but more than adequate for quick snaps
the eyemodule is so small you can take it with you everywhere and take some photos you would otherwise miss
my  year old daughter loves it because she can see the pictures right  away on the visor screen
i print them out  or  to an x page and  they look fine at that size
its really a fun challenge to try to create a  good photograph with that few pixels
im planning to create an online  gallery of images soon
the timelapse feature is a lot of fun  set it up  and the camera will capture images at intervals you have set
snapped into  the visor it doesnt look like a camera so you can take candid shots and  no one even knows you are taking photos
color images are about  kbytes  each so you will want the  mb version of the visor
i can imagine real  estate agents insurance adjusters salespeople househunters and anyone  with kids will enjoy this cool little camera
my other digital camera is a  kodak dc with x resolution
the eyemodule is clearly no  competition for it but they both have a place and a purpose
the eyemodule  is a fraction of the price much smaller in size and can grab a shot  within a second of turning it on
think of the eyemodule as a very small  more flexible digital alternative to polaroids and you wont be  disappointed
at over  a shot for polaroids the eyemodule will quickly  pay for itself toothis module is likely the most talked about visor attachment ive ever seen
and it was one of the first modules i purchasedthe reviews you read of high grain and low resolution of this classic eyemodule are true as are the high coolness and fun factorall in all this module is worth its price for two reasons the x gray scale mode is seems sharper than the color mode i guess it is not as sensitive to subtile lighting
for a quick snapshot in a meeting this works well the optional software allows you to put thumbnails into an addressbook eyecontact software has to be downloaded from their website
its almost worth the price alone to have a little photo of someone next to their address book infodont expect archival images  but be ready for a lot of funthe eyemodule is awesome  a super tiny super lightweight camera that you can have with you everywhere you take your visorpicture quality  dont expect to get archival quality pix  thats what your full size digital or film camera is for
eyemodule is meant to give you handy convenient digital pix of decent quality anytime and this it does wellease of use  shockingly simple
if you are used to typical pctype hardware installations a la windows you are in for a pleasant surprise
to install the camera add the software add the program icon to your main menu and start using the camera heres what to doplug the eyemodule inthats ityou need this cameralet me start by saying that i love this little gadget
it amuses me endlessly
i take it to otherwise boring meetings and it just looks like im making notes on my handspring when im snapping quick and funny pix of people
the camera is so small that nobody notices it
i take it on the subway and get great a day in the life of a commuter pictures
i use it to take pictures that the kids can include in school reports
i enjoy it thorougly
it is so easy to use
that said the resolution isnt very good
forget taking pictures of people from beyond  feet   feet if you want to see facial expressions
forget taking pictures in rooms with uneven lighting
dont even think about printing the pictures unless they are real closeups
it just doesnt capture that many pixels
but  keeping that in mind  its a great little camerawe have used the crv lithium photo battery in our kodak so we knew what we wanted to purchase however the product that is advertised in the picture is not what arrived
it was a crv but was not photo
i am not sure if this will make a difference but i need the battery
it happened to be  product number off from the lithium photo
i think it should still work fine just my only coni like this case
i like how the visor just clips into it and doesnt require any velco tape
the slots for credit cards business cards and money are very handy
the case isnt much larger than the visor itself and is thin enough to fit into a back pocket but you need to remember not to sit on it
if youre ever worried about the screen you can insert the visor in backwards and get extra protection from the plastic back theyve basically sewn the plastic cover that comes with the visor into the case
the construction is very nice
my only major wish is that the visor was completely sealed by the case
three sides remain mostly exposed to the elements so this case cant even be considered weather resistantthis thing allows you a grat deal of versatility
especially if you have a compact flash digital camera a laptop with a pci card slot and a desktop computer
you can use it much like a zip drive
usb makes easy installation there are driver updates you can get at the viking website if you are running win this is wonderfully convenient especially if you have more than one electronic device that uses smartmedia or compact flash as it will read both types of electronic media
after over a month of use ive had no problems with itbut i did have one heck of a time installing it
as noted by at least one other reviewer  if you have winme the software that comes with the unit is  useless
save yourself a few hours of frustration and get the drivers directly from the viking website
only once today as a matter of fact have i experienced a problem with my computer not recognizing the unit
a reboot did clear it up but rebooting is never an acceptable quotfixquot in my opinionmy rating loses one star for incomplete software amp the very occasional recognition problemthis is no longer the option there are better items no recommend now it was good  years ago i couldn change the number of the stars to i dont know how i lived without this unit
it provides very fast transfer of images preserves the batteries in my camera and allows me to work from within any software package without using any special software eg ive never had a software issue with this unlike the special camera softwaresa very nice feature is that this unit can handle any kind of memory other than sony memory sticks many competitors can handle just one or two
btw this unit even works with microdrives as long as you use the type ii compactflash adapter that should come with the drive
my only real complaint is that using the adapter for compactflash memory cards is a bit inconvenient as you must insert the card into the adapter and then insert the adapter into the unit  no big deal but its an extra stepthis is pretty essential especially if your memory cards exceed the low end mb
its a great value flexible in that it suports almost all memory types and its reliable
youll be pleased when you buy itinstall the driver software plug it into the usb port
download how hard is thati use it for downloading pictures
it keeps the camera free for taking pictures
what more can you say its about as exciting as a floppy disk drivebut it does what it was advertised to dowe have owned this vcr for almost  years now and it is our main vcr used for playing palfrom europe and regular ntsc tapes
we found that the receiver provides such sharp and vivid image we use it as a receiver for the regular tv program as well it looks way better than the builtin receiver in the sanyo tv set
so it gets a lot of use and we never had any reliability problems
you may want to leave sufficient space around it for cooling as it does generate a bit of heat
some people may accelerate its demise by stacking dvd players etc
on it
that is not a good ideapeople who remark on the quick wearout of the video heads probably use head cleaning products regularly
such products are mostly scam and at the least typically unneeded
the only benefit of their routine use is the ruination of the video heads
i have not had to clean the video heads yet on this machine nor did i ever have to do so on the  other vcrs i own and all have perfect picture quality after years and years of usethe vcr does display whether you are rewinding or playing a tape and there is a counter that shows elapsed time
in fact the built in display is rather informativethe conversion quality from pal to ntsc is quite good but one should not expect dvd quality from this technology
the unit does have some shortcomings the input system setting can be difficult to adjust the vcr itself is somewhat noisy high pitched motor noise and the manual is not all that helpful
taken these factors into consideration it still deserves a  stari got the samsung worldwide vcr for christmas and am really satisfied with it
its not just an excellent worldwide vcr but it also plays video images in such a crisp and clear quality much better than my standard vcrs
when i play a video from germany the quality is exactly the same as when i play a video from the us or from any other country
however we did have a little trouble trying to set it up
since its a worldwide vcr there was no tv channel that i could set it to   or 
so the worldwide vcr had to have extra cable wires hooked up to my tv for it to work
and then my second vcr had to be set to the channel line
it was also a huge inconvenience to call samsung technical support it took me two days to get someone to help
there is another item with the vcr that i noticed when a program has to be tracked it will automatically track it
but for some reason the color goes black amp white for about a split second
overall i really enjoy the vcrthis is a wellreviewed item so ill just voice a few points that are not necessarily obvious
the keyboard and its function keys were designed to be integrated with landwares takenote word processorbook reader application
unfortunately that application was discontinued for download in  takenote is one of those truly useful simple palmos programs that is intuitive and just does what its supposed to plus theres some depth if you get into all its functions and use the function keys on the keyboard
definitely worth getting this keyboard with the software on cd if you can
the keyboard is not meant to replace a full keyboard or one of those foldout targus or palm keyboards
at the time this keyboard was in demand it cost about  on sale compared to over  for the targus or palm keyboard
i recently got a palm keyboard for 
i wouldnt recommend paying more than  on ebay for the landware keyboard if you cant get the takenotewordsleuth disks
on the otherhand it has a nice form factor which is well suited to airplanes tiny student desks etc
wordsleuth is for people who like thesauruses
when i used a palm v with mb of memory there was no way i was going to keep a thesuarus installed
a dictionary would have been usefuli recently decided to investigate digital photography
my usual methodology when trying something new is to read everything i can get my hands on and then take the plunge
so starting with the fact that i have a  year old dell desktop running windows  i upgraded to windows  and added a dlink two slot usb card
then after comparing features and quality against price i chose the fugifilm finepix   so far i think its a good choice
i was concerned there might be hardwaresoftware installation problems because my usb was not factory installed but everything went smoothly
im really impressed with the simple straightforward ease of taking pictures and the picture quality
my desire is to overcome that feeling of disappointment when you get your pictures back from walmart and theyre not what you expected
digital is instant
if you dont get the picture you want shoot it again and erase the first one
very efficienti read a lot of reviews and also some background info on digital cameras
i bought this camera for the features and price
actually it is a little more complicated than i wanted because im not a techno junkie
it takes great pictures and is quite compact
i also bought the kodak rechargeable batters and charger a mb smartmedia card and a case logic brand case
the software was easy to install except you have to search to find the adobe photodelux pgm
i did have to get usb ports installed   i thought that would be better than having to buy a card reader
the transfer from camera to pc is fast but with the included software you have to save each picture individually while the camera is running
instead i learned to do it via my computer by selecting all copying all files and pasting to a folder of my choice
i would like to get a card reader but i need to find a reliable one without problems
in summary the fujifilm  is a great entrylevel camera
we bought it over the  because of the lens coveri read around quite a bit about the eye control
i was really looking forward to try it out
i set it up in a dark place and tested it
it worked like a charm
the problem is when you go out to the real world
the light around the eye cup messes the measurements and it will always focus on the wrong placeother than that the camera is quite light easy to use and powerful
if you have a modern canon dslr its basically the same with no lcdfor amateur photographers looking for a great slr i cant recommend this camera enough
it offers the user fully automatic or fully manual operation or as much help as you need with aperture and shutter speed priority modes as well as some custom modes for sports portraits landscapes etc
there are three metering modes depending on the lighting although none of these is true spot meteringthe autofocus on this camera is excellent and seems to be faster and more reliable than my canon eos  perhaps because of the infrared focus assist light
this camera also includes electronic gaze selected focus points which seems to work quite well on this camera for methere are a number of custom functions which occasionally come in handy like the depth of field preview and mirror lockup
there is a hot shoe on top as well as a built in popup flash which i rarely use but occasionally comes in handythe body is very sturdy and feels stable in ones hand and of course the back and right front mode selection wheels are a canon trademark which i happen to like very muchin summary and in my humble opinion this is a really top notch slr and can be found for rock bottom prices right now on the used market
before dslrs took off this camera body was used by many pros as a backupvery likely your first lens will be this onethey are incorperated into most of the canon kits available today and why notit features the most popular focal lenghtsfrom wide angle to telephoto this zoom lens gives you the best of both worldsthe apature is kind of limited but for a starter lens this is greatat first was not crazy about the lens but after i used it a while it was hard at first to get it to focus
the one down side is it doesnt have stabilizer on it
i cant wait to get a lens with f aperture under you just have to understand this lens for what it is and what its limitations are
its not an l no is no usm
its an old lens technology my lens was a remnant of the old eos s film camera but its an ef mount so it fits my new tiits best for still photography or portraits with good lighting not for sports
my photos of the orange tulip shows surprising resultswhat was pleasant was the lack of ca or purple fringing
canon has ca that needs to be corrected post but this lens doesnt need itdo a search about a macro hack for this lens
then you might change your mind about this cheap but capable lensthis is the same lens that came on my  digital rebel that i bought about  years ago shot about  photos with it gave to my son and the shutter failed sent to canon and had it repaired and gave to my daughter
one of the lenses came loose in the old one but the price was really good and it worked for all that time so i replaced the original with another one just like it
its cheap but it works much better than the price would indicatedso this is a great starter lens it came with my canon body when i got my camera and ive used it tons
it is light smooth fast to focus and cheap
my only problem was the number of times i found myself stepping back because the mm end of the zoom wasnt wide enough
i now carry a  instead and love that lens come on amazon  get it in stock
if youre on a budget then this lens is great
if you can afford the little extra go for the  insteadgood lens
nice build quality for a plastic lens
easy to zoom
af works just fine and is very quiet
the overall picture quality is on a par with a kit lens
you can get very sharp photos with this lens if you stop it down a bit 
f works great
if i had to buy this lens again i would get the vr verson for a little more money
hence the  starsarrived safely and in a good package
works as expected
nice to have a variety of lenssorry what more to sayi have no complaints with this lens at all
it is great quality for the price
you can get some blur and fuzzy pics when shooting at  with no cam stand but that is a given for any budget zoom lens when shooting by handthis is a good beginners lens
it works better then the standard    lens that came with my camerai find this to be an overall useful lens to have in my slr bag when i am out and about  going to local events and even for trial runs at photographing specific projects
although not fast on the af mode it is far better to focus manually when you are photographing wildlife  especially birds  it does respond well enough when you are awaiting that perfect moment you have the patience to wait for  like with landscapes
this is one lens that i keep in the bag all the time
eventually  ill upgrade to the is version but for now  a good economical alternative to use in the meantimefast shipping
i ordered this a week and half before christmas
i did the  day shipping because i was worried that i wouldnt get it in time for christmas
packaged very good
arrived faster than delivery date
my mother just bought a canon dslr and she was worried about not having a zoom lens because she was used to the digi cams so i bought her this lens
we tested the product and seems to be working like it should bethis lens is fine however i still cannot get close enough to the birds to see the detail that i wish to captureso i am looking for an even greater zoom nowsimply u want an average priced canon zoom lens here it isi havent tried different brand cuz i just found and bought this one and its doing its jobgreat buy
at first i thought i was getting a peace of junk
i have tested this camera several times a day
i have found it to be very usefull for targets that are a little ways out there
i have gone to freeport bahamas and took great pictures with this lens
i am kindaa new to this lens
i have liked taking picture since i was  years old and now my hobbie is photographyi am on a budget college student who picked an expensive hobby
ive been looking for a decent zoom lense for an offordable price for awhile and decided to give this one a shot
i can honestly say that i am not at all disapointed
although you cant compare it to a  lense with is look at the price
if you are on budget like me and looking for a decent lense this one will get the job done
i found that at mm it get a little blury if you dont use the tripod but still this lense give an exceptional images
i love to go to a park and sneak up on birds very happy with the quality
i hope my experience help some of you
my advice is do a little research because what is good for other people maynot be right for you
happy shootingi really love this lens
i didnt really know much about cameras before getting my latest canon ti and this lens
i know it is mmmm but i didnt realize you had to be  ft away to get a decent closeup shot more my fault
otherwise this lens has a great zoom capability and its easy to operatecanon ef lenses have a built in af motorcompared to camera bodybased af motors lensbased motors have driving energy with lower transmission lossthe af operation is therefore quick quiet and highly preciseall ef lenses also have emd electromagnetic diaphragm to control the aperture electronicallythe aperture can be set either with an electronic dial or with the electronic pulse signal sent according to the exposure readingthe aperture control is therefore precise and umnatchedto go with canons reputation they introduce a lens that is truely immaculateits telephoto zoom from mmmm is a great addition to a current setup with a mm lens and is ideal for shooting sports wildlife or portraitsit can compress an image to give dramatic effectsthe optics and construction are compact and lightweight compared to my nikon fm setup and the x zoom is greata very steady shot even at maximum zoomthe apature stops are adaquate being ff but could be widerall in all an awesome lens for the moneyanother canon hitthe lens is the same as the ef mm f iii however it uses a usm to drive the autofocus rather than a dc motorspecs taken from canons catalogueif youre new to photography this is a great telephoto lens for the beginning photographer
if youre new to photography and want to zoom lens this i dont think is a bad place to start
the fstops arent superlow but it will still work and if youre in the beginning stages of photography youll just want to have a lens you can practice on
another thing to note is the glass and this is not the greatest glass the quality of the glass really affects the clarity of your pictures is not a canon l lens by any stretch but again its good enough for the basic beginning photographer
and it only  at the time of writing this review its goodyou should always buy a uv filter to protect the glass
this in my opinion is the one thing everybody who purchases an expensive lens should do
uv filters dont affect the photographs you take but its a layer of plastic between the scratchable glass and the world around you
its a must buythis is another great lens for about  morecanon efs mm f is stm lens for canon slr camerasthis is a better lens and i recommend this one over the mmif youre more advanced if youre not new to photography and youre looking for something with better picture quality and faster motors ultrasonic motors aid in the autofocus process then this lens is probably the one you want to get but it costs over  at the time of this review
it also has image stabilization which helps in low light environmentscanon ef mm f is usm lens for canon eos slr camerasanother option you might want to consider is this lens herecanon ef mm fl usm telephoto zoom lens for canon slr camerasits a canon l series and while it only has a  mm max zoom it has a constant  fstop which allows for faster frame rates on all zoom levels
plus the glasses just better and it has watertight construction
the only real drawback to this lens is that its over  but again its really high qualityi have purchased all three of these lenses and my favorite is the the  mm canon l lens its just such a nice lens plus you look really bad ass using itif you have any questions feel free to leave a question here and ill get back to youthanks for readingthis lens without is
is useless without a tripod
there is no way to hold it steady at this magnification
i did have it on a tripod for what i was shooting and it produced beautiful resultsgood for its price but if you are not on budget i recomend investing in a better lens such as a sigmahave had some good pics with it
the usm is super helpful
the only thing is that its a little more difficult to use in lower light settingsi have used this lens nearly everyday for over a year now mainly taking sports and wildlife photos and since it has been my first lens i have come to love it
the lens is great in good sun light but once the sun goes down you are screwed
i shoot with a digital rebel and this lens with indoor sports at iso  aint pretty
the lens has taken a lot of heat on the web for slow focusing and being soft at mm  hard to argue this
the lens is amazingly sharp when youre at around mm but the longer you reach the less sharp it becomes and that can be bad news if youre shooting something in the distance and plan to crop heavily outfielders birds etc
but if youre like me and cant afford a ridiculous  lens this one will make you happy for the cost and abilities it is well worth its price
would i sell it after buying a better lens
probably not  it is light and easy to carry
play to this lens strengths and youll get some nice results
i have the hood and dont see any noticeable differences
i took a few shots once with the is version and didnt notice much of a difference either
not everyone can be mr fi bought this lens used from adoramavia amazon e for only 
thats anoutstanding price
and when adoramacom says excellent conditionthey mean it
this lens was in newmint condition
ill buy my next lensfrom adorama without a doubt
i bought this lens to replace my zoom for i wanted greater range
many reviews state that at the highendthis lens isnt quality
i beg to differ
ive taken many photos atthe mm setting hand held and seen crisp clear and amazing resultsfor the price its an outstanding lens
the build quality is greaterthan my former mm because it seems more solid and has a metalmounti give it a  out of  for sure
its not the usm so its slower tofocus
but i own other usm lenses and i cant tell a major differencethats why i opted to try this lens out
shes a keepernice affordable lense in adequate lighting or with a good strong flash
fast silent autofocusprovides a good basic addition to the lens collection that can be used for everyday school sporting events as well as other outdoor activities requiring some distance from the actioni have taken some excellent images with this lens i use it almost every day
the only thing that irks me and it may be me but too often the autofocus over shoots the target and looses focus at the least opportune times but overall i am happy with its capabilitiesan older zoom telephoto but still does a good job
does not have the usm quiet motor and of course no stabilization but still a good buy if you use a tripod for your long shotsi havent gotten to really put this lens to the test but from what i have shot so far this seems to be a great option if you want a long lens for a low pricefor the price this is a very good lens ive used it numerous times and im very satisfied with itthis is a good lens wish it was an efs so much easier to shoot with have to have a steady hand or tripod to shoot with this one not a lens for a beginnerive been using this with my new rebel xs since christmas taking lots of pics at the dog park
the shots come out sharp clear and colorful
this includes plenty of action shots of dogs running and playingthe autofocus works fast and is quite accurate
i doubt if the usm version of this lens is worth the extra money
in fact i just got the canon  is and i find the autofocus to be faster and more accurate on this lessexpensive  lens
unfortunately it does lack is so it may not do well using handheld in lowlight situations
but it absolutely rocks using it handheld in outdoor sunlightthe build quality seems quite good with a nice solid look and feel
the zoom ring isnt as fluid as much more expensive lenses
but that is to be expectedoverall an excellent value especially for rebel users
after all do you really want to spend more for your telephoto zoom lens than you paid for your bodylens kit in the first place
if you have a highend eos model then you should certainly spring for an lseries lens
but for a rebel this guy does the trick and does it welli bought this lens used with the intent of using it my schools sporting events
without is image stabilization the pictures come out blurry under certain circumstances this annoys me but i have compensated
the zoom on the other hand is amazing and what pictures that do come out look stunning
if you plan on using this lens for sports please consider the lens that is a step up which is the canon ef mm f iii is telephoto zoom lens
that lens includes the image stabilizer i mentioned earlier
if you plan on using this in full sun or with flash then this is a great lens
i will probably end up using my tripod instead of investing in another lens because under other conditions this lens rockseven though the speed is slow its great for outdoor shooting
you cant beat the price for an entry level lenshard to hate on the lens
functions well i can see the field up close event with i am sitting in the nosebleedsmy husband bought this to expand a canon ti dslr that just had the kit lens
no it doesnt have is bucks for a canon mm no its not a l lens  bucks
but for the price and the expandability it offers it was a good purchase
i kills me to see people pay  bucks for a lens then bash it because it isnt a  dollar lens
we would all love to have one of those
this is a good lens for what it is a manual focus on distant objects lens
one way to get around the hunting on auto focus is to put the camera on spot metering
and if you want even quicker shooting just flick the camera to auto let it do the work
this allows the camera to pinpoint the focus on a single spot
it actually stays on the camera  of the time with the lower mm rating on zoom its just a little closer than the mm kit lenses but with the quick ability to go to mm
one of the reasons i chose the canon was the ability to use older ef lenses thus saving money and expanding as i go
i still feel it was a great purchase and dont regret it at alli dig this lens a lot but the only negative is the weight
im a totally amateur photographer and when you zoom all the way in the photos come out a little blurry because the lens is so heavy that the camera shakes
got a tripod the other day and my blurry photo problem went awayi can not afford the best in the world from canon and this lens is what i expected for the money
its not like my best lens when it comes to feel quality and construction but for the price its a good deal
you must be careful when installing it on the camera becasue it doesnt snap in place like the kit lens
just make sure its on and all is well
the picture quality is good and crisp
the colors are good so over all i have no complaints
i have a  and bought the  for a little more zoom and am happy i didi bought this lens not quite realizing it didnt have image stabilization my bad
its an excellent lens i like the optics though i do wish the aperture was a little bigger though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality picturesmy friend got this in a kit with his rebel ti and sold it to me brand new
ive found it to be well worth the money for the use ive gotten out of itbetween about mm this lens takes great portrait shotshead shots
out of focus elements behind the subject look okay not super smooth like the higher end lenses but not too bad either
the lens does suffer from some chromatic aberration even when stopped down to f or so but it is not particularly badif using this lens to capture a subject that is far away from you such as a bird or other woodland critter you will likely need a tripod
there is no image stabilizer in this lens so if you are zoomed in all the way on a subject  yards away or so things can get pretty shaky if you are using your camera handheld
even when shooting in a good amount of light ive found that i need a tripod to really capture those far away subjects without any motion blur resulting from slight movements of the camerathis lens is also a macro which means it can focus on subjects very close useful for wedding rings flowers insects etc
while its not a true macro lens like some of canons other offerings its good enough to get some nice photos of insects and other small objectsnot as sharp as canons higher end lenses either but sharper than the kit lens
if you can afford it i would recommend the is image stabilized version of this lensfor those on a budget who are trying to supplement their kit lens and give themselves a longer reach when they need it or for those who want a nice headshot lens without spending very much i would highly recommend adding this lens to your kiti like this lens because of the moire you get when zoomingits sharp well contrasted collors and not heavy or volkycame fast well packaged and i recomend itexcellent lens clear and clear
just one issue in long range distances it takes some time to focusi didnt expect it to be as good as its higher end model wich i think is like almost double in price
but it works amazing
has a good range of zoom
focuses quickly
only thing is if your looking to shoot anything in very low lighting it wont come out too good even with your highest iso setting
but overall it gets the job donefor the price and range of this  zoom it probably cannot be beat but dont expect to actually have consistently sharp photos when shooting at mm
the  aperture allows you to shoot handheld with decent sharpness in the daytime however to really get a sharp image stopping down to f is needed and by then hand holding is only an option in very bright sunauto focus is not perfect but generally finds the subject quick enoughlens has no zoom lock so when the lens is facing downward while photographing or just walking the lens will extend due to gravity which is kind of annoyingthe size and weight of lens is pretty small and light when considering a mm zoomall and all this lens was a very good purchase when i bought it  years ago for  on ebay
although now after using a few canon l lenses i find myself not wanting to take this out of the bag because the sharpness is disappointing
however again it must be said it is probably the cheapest way you can get a zoom of this range and still have usable imagesi love it its cheap good looking long zoom easy to take the pics too far fromsometime spy for babe bikini hahahaha just for people learn how to play with camera like meforget about professional onei purchased this lens with my minimalist budget in mind and i must say that for the money it isnt too bad
it lacks a fancy focus motor ie
usm which makes it a bit slow and noisy but you cant find a more inexpensive long distance telephoto lens
it is perfect for the amateur photographer without a lot of moneyhere is a zoom lens that produces good photos but not as good as  i get with my canon  mm lens
i am overall satisfied with it and  usm is a definite plus
however do not expect astonishingly clear pictures from this lens
and you really have to use a tripod to get the most out of it
i do not carry this lens out most of the time in the camera bag because it is rather heavy
buy it only if you need the zoom
i have experienced no mechanical or optical problems with this lens and therefore quite satisfiedi got it as a gift an i learned long ago its not the hardware its the man behind itit is slow an you do need to make shore your not shacking just means you need to be little better with camera not having the usm be nice  but some times you need to relay on your self for the shot i also seen this lens at alot of airshows an get killer shots of thunder birds an blue anglesthis is a decent quality telephoto zoom lens
i purchased it at the same time as a canon rebel sl and so i was able to get this at a promo price making it an even better deal
mm allows for some tight closeups but because it isnt an especially bright lens so it is best suited to bright outdoors
i havent noticed any vignetting or chromatic aberrations they are probably there but not to the point of being a bother
it would be difficult finding a lens in this focal length at a lower pricebottom line up front  a very good if underrated telephoto zoom lens
highly recommended for beginner to intermediate photographers
best choice for the second lens you purchasethe canon ef mm f iii usm should be a strong contender for the second lens you own for your canon dslr camera
your first lens was probably a kit lens typically a standard zoom lens that has a range starting around mm and goes to around mm give or take a bit
youve enjoyed that lens but youre looking for something elsesomething with more distance something you can really zoom in to see the action
you want a telephoto lens
youre also probably wanting a wide angle zoom lens something that will pull in that grand vista in front of youthats a different review but also a good choice for a second or third lensso you start looking at all the different lenses out there trying to find the best one for your money so you can take those photos youve been dreaming of taking
but it gets confusing
so many numbers
youre just starting out and youre wanting to make art not do math problems
and so many different opinions
what is bestso heres my two cents
its biased like everyone elses opinions here but ill try to tell you what im thinking and whyfirst pick a lens that goes with your camera
if you own a canon camera in the long run youll be happier with canon lenses
ive owned a few other brands for my canon cameras but theyve sometimes disappointed me
canon lenses usually dont
there are several reasons for this but the most practical is that your camera is a system
the canon camera talks electronically to the canon lens and the canon flash best so if youre using any automatic settings youll get the best results using canon products
you can get just as good of photos using different lenses and different flashesbut you have to do all the work of communicating with the system by using manual settings
not a problem if you know what youre doing but if youre newyoull want to use canon products to help with the workload and learning curve
even if youre experienced it just makes everything significantly easier
so im biased there but you at least know where im coming from
my wife calls it lazy i prefer to call it efficientnext you need to think about what you want to do with the lens
since youre looking at this lens youre probably thinking you want something that will give you the ability to take photos of things far away or at least make something that looks small look a lot bigger in your photo
a telephoto lens will do this
for me at least this was the perfect second lens option
getting futher away from things usually was easier than getting closer especially with wildlife
so what kind of telephoto do you need
for most folks starting out a zoom telephoto as opposed to a prime focus telephoto is a better optionit allows you to zoom in and out and better frame the photo youll take
so youll be looking for a lens that shows a range of focal lengths say picking some random numbersmmmm
the tradeoff is that youll have larger focal ratio fstop fnumberits called lots of things which means youll need longer shutter speeds but thats going to hold true for all zooms
image stablization will help with that some but in practice if youre using bright light like sunlight i havent found it makes that much difference and it costs significantly moreso that brings us to this lens
its an inexpensive telephoto zoom lens compared to other lenses out there
its no frills and does the job
its also more light weight than most telephoto zoom lenses out there which helps when youre holding the lens and camera by hand remember higher focal ratios mean longer shutter speedsmeaning you have to be more steady for longer
yes there are better telephoto lenses out therebut youll pay more for them
and the big secret
youll not get that much better photos
dont get me wrong i have some l lenses as well and theyre wonderfulbut i dont necessarily get better photos from them
ive had the canon ef mm f iii usm lens for almost  years and ive taken some amazing photos with this lens
why
because i take a lot of photos so i have a lot of practice with it
it also helps having steady hands although being a doctor and an expert military marksman means i have some practice there andor a tripod but really there is no substitue for practice
that goes for any lens but if youre new to slr photography a good inexpensive lens like this to practice with will more than pay for itselftelephoto lens
light weight
inexpensive
good quality
you can ask for more but youll pay for it
this one does the trick and works well
great to start with and the skills youll develop will translate when if ever you upgrademy tests of this lens show sharp results from mm if stopped down by one stop
beyond mm it takes progressively more aperture reduction to get sharp photos
using f at mm gives excellent sharpness but then you need a tripod in all but very bright sunlight
so this lens will take sharp pictures but requires bright light or a tripod at the long endthe new mm is version has a similar build quality and optics maybe a tad better optics at the long end and provides a stop advantage which allows handholding under most conditions
however it costs over three times as much  but may be worth it to travel tripodfree
i prefer the mm fl which costs about the same as the is version but produces even sharper images with eyepopping clarity and contrast  even wide open at f no stopping down is needed at any focal length
the llens is slightly larger is offwhite gets noticed and has no is but not needed unless it gets really dark since shooting at f gives better results than the is lens at fhavent got to use it as much as i would have liked but i did like it the few times i used it
graet shipping
will buy from this seller agin
thanksi upgraded from a  to this lens and have really appreciated the extra range
sure this isnt a professional lens but for us advanced amateurs it offers all the versatility at a very affordable price
my only problems with this lens is that focus tends to be slow and the barrel is a little stiff
id still highly recommend it thoughi bought this for my dad as a gift and he likes it no complains so i guess this is a pretty good lensihavent got the chance to use it alot but so far its a good lens need to take some more outdoor shots to really test it out but so far its a pretty good lens its stable and its well madei guess the universe sensed how much i really wanted a mm lens
i would always search for sales and just dreamed
but how can i afford one of these lenses
then one day this guy popped up for  canon yet
sure it was used but for  it was worth a try
this was more within my budget and i am very very happy and gratefula good lens bearing in mind the price
the real downside is its weight
if you dont frame that shot reasonably quickly you will end up with numerous shots of your shoesas i diduse a tripodthis lens have really delivered the versatility it promised
i have taken pictures of my friend who is my neighbor from about  yards away and the quality of the picture was as if i was within  feet of him
its a nice lens and i would recommend it to anyone who doubts the amount of satisfaction they will receive  from their investmentotto gi have used this lens on a canon d d and dm with no problemsthe is wouldve been nice but for what i paid for it there is no complaints
not as fast but definitely doableive used both this lens and the mm canon and ive stuck to the  for a few reasons chromatic aberrations  the  has a lot of it the  not so much
size  the  is a big lens not really easy to work with
the focal length is also a bit weird the  is perfect for crop sensor cameras
is  the  doesnt have it the  does
at long focal lengths is is a musti use my  for portraits and wildlife and i had used the  for wildlifemacro and honestly if you know how to use the lens it will work well the only thing that got me away from it was the color fringing aberrations when doing macroshould you buy it
if you have the extra cash get the  is
if not you can buy this and you should be happywhen i bought it it cost about  plus insurance of  wow what a deal
kinda salty though because the price is so much cheaperi am buying the rebel ti with the default  lens
i am looking for an additional lens for a bit longer range
i am leaning towards this model but also came across this one canon efs mm f is ii telephoto zoom lens for canon digital slr cameras could someone please illustrate the differences between these modelsi bought this lens soon after i got my rebel xt so i didnt know much about lenses
now that i have been using it for about a year and have since learned a little more about photography i kind of wish that i had bought the is version or maybe even one of the higher quality and much more expensive l versions
im no pro but even i can tell that it becomes pretty soft at the long end
plus the front element rotates which can be a problem when using a circular polarizing filter
as mentioned in other reviews the use of a tripod can go a long way in helping to minimize the need for is but a tripod is not always practical
plus when i bought it i didnt anticipate that i would use it as frequently as i have though i still use my regular zoom more often
but despite its weaknesses its still a pretty good lens especially for the money
it has allowed me to get many shots i would not have been able to get otherwise and with decent image quality
if youre truly budgetminded and just want the extra reach for fun then this would be a good choice
however if your serious or plan to be and can afford it i would go with something a little higher qualityalthough somewhat limited in that you only have two fstops f and f you have five focal lengths you can choose from mm mm mm mm and mm making it a lens you can use for portriats or landscapesthis is a good lens however it does suffer from chromatic abberations
which if you use adobe light room can be fixed
sharpness is good though even at mm
which is more than i can say for the  nikkor  vr that i bought for my nikon camera
if you have a little time to invest in photo editing this lens does just finei bought this to use along with the canon eos rebel ti  mp cmos digital slr camera and digic  imagingbody  mm lens
i have been using this set up for a while now and am very pleased
it does everythingit is supposed to do and it does it without a lot of headacheshassles
highly recommendedjust remember that at this price there is no image stabilization
so bright light and fast shutter speeds are called for
a good lens none the lessi am satisfied with this lens wrt the price i have paid for this
 is very cheap
agred it does not have usm
but i am able to take some good photos with this lens
though i havent tried sports photography yet
i would recomend this lens to photography learners and those does not want to pay more money for usm or is functionalitytakes great telephoto shots while using a tripod
if looking to take these kind of photos without a tripod you may want look into one with is unless you have a steady hand
i had borrowed this same lens for a week from a friend and then decided to purchase
i am very pleased with this lensbut i dont take that many pictures from that far away
im just a dad taking pictures of his kids in action
i usually dont carry this lens with me
but i have used it and it does get me closer to the action when im not closeim relatively new to dslr photography and this is my first nonkit lens though i have tired other lenses in the store i dont think that really countsso far im very pleased with this lens
the zoom is very satisfyingbuildings a mile away become a useable size
ill just break it down into pros and conspro smooth focus and zoom irisespro good image quality for most of the lens rangepro affordablepro provides great zoom ability  completes the kit lens con autofocus is kinda slowcon fstop requires a lot of light when zoomed in around mm
this would be true of any lens thoughcon images might not be that clean when zoomed in around mm
this could be due to the increased gain or shutter speed but in general i found i had to work a lot harder to get a crisp sharp image when i zoomed in at mm again could be true of any lens but this is the only one i knowultimately im really glad i got it
im guessing other lenses are better because they cost more but i cant comment on thosethis is a perfect companion for party family and portrait shots
ettl works very well for offcentered subjects
high speed sync works for all shutter speed from  to s making fill flash very easy
also nd curtain sync provides very creative control in night photographytheres not a whole lot to say in a review about a flash
there are better flashes for more money and flashes with less features for less money
i bought this flash to replace the onboard flash of my elan iie
it greatly outperforms the flash on the camera body
also if you use larger diameter lenses like the canon mm the flash on the camera body is slightly obscured by the lens itself
the ex is an ideal mid level flash for the canon eos system
if youre trying to learn more about flash photography and want to experiment you cant do much because its totally automatic
the higher level model ex ex offer many for features for a pricethanks for your timeas mentioned in other reviews the eyepiece rubber needs to be rolled back or trimmed to get a good view through them
i will most likely end up trimming mine as the rubber is thick when you roll it back and does not leave much room for your nose and comfortother than that the view is superb not quite as good as zeiss but close enough when you factor in the stabilizer
very noticeable difference between using them with the system on vs offjust received the bins last night
i carefully opened the box and it was packaged very well
kudos to the canon team
i was expecting a brick and it would weight a thousand pounds but based on the x i picked up in las vegas last week i knew it wasnt going to be an issue for me
im a big guy but not like arnold and thought it was pleasant weightwise
i actually thought it was light which could be a first
i thought i would try my rechargeables at first and was disappointed that they didnt have enough charge
i tested the rest of my batteries and found a few that had a bit more charge
unfortunately the canon wanted even more charge as they only lasted  seconds so i broke out the batteries that came with the bins
they are not for resale panasonic alkalines
the lock sound of the is was much reduced with new batteries and the is kicked in within a second or two max
since it was night i pointed the bins to the sky and started to look around
stars that you couldnt see with the naked eye magically appeared in the bins
it was stunning
and bright stars to the eye really popped in the bins making the x worth it and the brightness of the mm objectives definitely appreciated
the is really really helps as the stars were shooting all over the fov
it wasnt perfect but the shake was greatly reduced
the focus knob was perfect and it was easy to find the sweet spot
the pupil distance function was very easy to do too though it is different than other bins ive used
no issue there either
i actually like the eye cups and thought it would initially be an issue
i was happy this wasnt going to be an issue for my eyes no glasses
i kept them extended and didnt roll them down
the front plastic caps fit as well as could be expected
i purchased the canon objective plastic covers and they fit well
no issue there
i am giving this initial review a star but after review of the bins during the day and i get better familiarity with the is function with the batteries it may change probably go up
i consider a star very good only after using them for around an hour but only  minutes outside looking up in the skywithout the is system i can only look through these things for a few minutes before my trembling hands have me nauseous
but the is allows me to look through these as long as i can support them
like another reviewer i find i have to fold down the eye cups for a better viewi fail to understand why canon cant include a cover for the objective lenses particularly at this price tag
aside from that the only complaint worth mentioning is that they are rather heavy and you wont be pointing these at the sky for too long without a tripod or something supporting your elbowsif you can afford them and dont mind a little weight you will be pleasedi have been an avid birder watcher for several decades
ive owned most of the topof theline european binoculars zeiss leica etc
over the years
i purchased the canon x is binocs over   years ago and i love them
however thinking that more magnification would be better i ordered the x is pair a year later
i have since sold them and use mostly the canon  power
here are a few reasons why they were not right for me  bigger is not always better
the extra weight and size caused me to leave them in the closet and take the xs one of my other pair or worst no binoculars at all
even the best optics are no good if you dont have them with you when you need them
  smaller field of view
it takes some practice seeing a bird with your naked eyes and then swinging the binoculars up smoothly so that you keep the bird or any other small subject in line with your vision
as experienced as i am at this i found it harder to accomplish with the narrow view of these powerful optics
sometimes all you get is a few seconds to spot and identify a rare bird
quicker is better
  shallower depth of field
with greater magnification the accuracy of your focusing becomes more critical due to a reduced range of focus
with distant objects i found myself fiddling with focus knob more than i would like to
  less than the best optical performance
dont get me wrong these are very sharp high quality glasses just not the best
when viewing objects against the sun you can get a color flare or ghost image chromatic aberration
only the highest quality optical designs get close to completely eliminating this problem
when you are trying to tell one bird from another closely related species color is often all than you have to go byi am still a big fan of the image stabilization technology and i still use my x is binoculars daily however the idea that more magnification is always better especially for birding is misleading
i am planning to buy the canon x l series binos
in the past this magnification has been my favorite and the added benefit of is will make it an even better choice
the biggest reason for this decision is the superiority of the l class optics
i own several l lenses for my canon digital slrs and they are superbif you dont mind the size and weight or you really need the extra power like for astronomical observation these are great binoculars to add to your collection
if you looking one pair to use on a regular basis and you want the best optical quality combined with image stabilization i would go with the x is l glasses and save yourself the time and expense of buying the wrong pair
but thats just my opinion
if you can take a look at both of them in person before you buy onecanon x l image stabilization waterproof binocularspros great reach for the price
feels well made in my hands
takes nice pictures
very little if any distortion on the edges of my picturescons higher f stop means it struggles under low light conditionsall in all its pretty much exactly what i expectedcanon ef lenses have a built in af motorcompared to camera bodybased af motors lensbased motors have driving energy with lower transmission lossthe af operation is therefore quick quiet and highly preciseall ef lenses also have emd electromagnetic diaphragm to control the aperture electronicallythe aperture can be set either with an electronic dial or with the electronic pulse signal sent according to the exposure readingthe aperture control is therefore precise and umnatchedto go with canons reputation they introduce a lens that is truely immaculateits telephoto zoom from mmmm is a great addition to a current setup with a mm lens and is ideal for shooting sports wildlife or portraitsit can compress an image to give dramatic effectsthe optics and construction are compact and lightweight compared to my nikon fm setup and the x zoom is greata very steady shot even at maximum zoomthe apature stops are adaquate being ff but could be widerall in all an awesome lens for the moneyanother canon hitspecs taken from canons cataloguewas a great lens for shooting candids at outdoor events but next time ill get something with a better aperture for a nice blur in the background
at f all the people in the background were too clear and it took away from the subjectso great lens just didnt work for candids in a crowd like i had hoped
live and learnill be honest in saying that this lens doesnt absolutely thrill me
but it doesnt disappoint either
it is a decent lens for the price and an excellent starter lens
i bought this lens when i made the step up to slr with my d
it takes some decent pictures
not stunningly sharp yet usable for a number of tasks
im not so sure about action shots yet though
the main test i had with it was a volleyball game my wife was coaching
i rattled off  shots with this lens and got about  that i was happy with
i havent really used it since then based on this
ive learned more things to help my photography in this situation and i have learned that i probably wasnt using the correct focus drive for the situation
that most likely accounts for the vast majority of shots i didnt care for
even though i now know this i somehow associate this lens with my disappointment with those shots
ive since upgraded to an older  pushpull zoom lens that i like a lot better
i may sell this lens but ill give it another shot before i do that
aside from that the build quality is good for the price and it is fairly lightweight for the zoom you get with it
its not a terribly fast lens apeturewise but it seems to work well enough
i dont think you can get a better zoom lens for the price so i cant knock it too much
overall youd be wise to start off with a zoom like this one and work from there
its a great starting block lensthis is the other lens i got when i bought my canon body the main one being a 
it lasted me a long time especially when you drop a teleconvertor into the mix
it is most definately an amateur lens
dont expect poster sharp results
but then look at the price
you get what you pay for and for what you pay for this lens you get a great deal
ive since upgraded to a  and passed this lens on to a friend who also loves it
if you can afford the extra about  more id recommend the  for extra range
if not ive no complaints about this lensas an added bonus if you get the other starter lens the  the filter screw size is the same so youll need to buy fewer filters as they will be usable on both lensesi bought this lens on the advice of the other reviewers and i was not at all disappointed
this is a fantastic lens for what you pay
it is indeed a light light lens and it almost feels cheap but it functions great and takes great shots
when focusing manually it doesnt feel as smooth as some other lenses
but you really cant go wrong with this lensi just bought a digital rebel about a month ago
love the camera my old ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesnt offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel
this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item
another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks
when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel you dont get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the builtin flash
the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the ex to focus the lens this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs
the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use but as a advanced amateur im glad theyre there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff
the wireless slave capability is handy but youve got to have at least one more ex ex or ex to use that
i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head its important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or updownthis should make the head sturdier than ive seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts
this unit is a honkerreally big and no lightweight either
get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you
whats the difference between this and the ex
the  has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes for me anyway it wasnt worth almost two hundred dollars more for the  all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that arent there on older stuff
i like this flash it covers well cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use
when you get yours dont lose that book canon doesnt seem to have them online anywhere i can find and ive seen places that want to charge you  bucks for a new onegood tool for removing any smudges on the lens
safer than using a microfiber cloth that may have collected dust particlesnever had one of these before  easy to carry and use and really works a treat i searched around until i found a marker cap that fits the brush end so dirt cant get into retracted brush between uses
they should have done that but none of the brands do that ive seengood itemcaution  some other well known brands of the same tool can cost over  and seem to be the same mfga great way to keep your lenscamera clean and ready for that perfect shotive used lens pens since they were introduced
the chamois end is great for smudges and ive never damaged a lens coating with it
i never use the brush end since it is rather coarse
i prefer a bulb blower and a goat hair artists brushit works it works
great antidote for curious young fingers and clumsy old ones
and you can carry it anywhere as you would a thick pen with a good clipnote that nikon sells an identical item for slightly more
actually the plastic slider button is a different color but otherwise it is identical
i wonder who the oem isthis is a nice camera
it is just the right size  very small but not too small to be hard to handle
the pictures we have taken with look great both on printed photos local printer and through online service and on screen
given that the camera was not cheap i was a little dissapointed that i then had to dish out more money on the following memory card  it only comes with  mb you probably want at least  mb  rechargable batteries and a charger better editing software than comes with camera cable for serial port only an issue if you dont have usb but you really need usb or the pictures take forever to downloadgood camerthis was a direct replcement for the same camera that was to expensive to repair so buying a used one was more economicalan external antenna is a must
i take this with me whether i use my car or someone elses car or a rental i consider it worth the trouble of carrying it around
you really never know when you will absolutely need it and id rather have it with me than notcobra is a good brand name and i am happy with this handhelddo yourself a favor and get an external car mount cb antenna or at least a telescopic from radioshack or online
i tested this radio against my scanner
the antenna makes huge difference
cb radios are supposed to use whips
this is just the laws of physics
the rubber duckie included is no good
it may only work for the car in front or behind youthe bottom line is its a portable low power cb radio
lets set the expectations accordingly
if you dont care to have a cb specifically but just need a radio to talk to your buddies on a trip then there are better optionsi can understand why it doesnt charge the batteries
i guess it would require an expensive circuit to charge  yes nine
aas
a separate charger or using disposable alkaline lithium if this radio sits in your bug out bag batteries is the way to goill do more testing to figure out the max distance i can get out of it in my areawe had to take a long roadtrip during some questionable weather
i wanted to have a cb in the minivan so i could listen to truckers learn about traffic problems and hear about road conditions
also i wanted a weather radio
this unit had the features i desired
it was quickly delivered and worked fine outofthebox
i used the included v adapter and kept it powered up during the whole trip
i used a roof mounted cobra antenna a coupled to this radio via a bnctostandard adapter
because i didnt know what language id hear over the cb i also got a earphonemicrophone combination that plugs into this handheld
this setup worked great on the trip
range wasnt wonderful  probably about a mile or so
but i did not have the equipment to set the swr of the antenna so i wasnt too surprised
an internal swr meter would have earned this  stars
would i get it again
yes the setup worked out fine for us
truckers could hear me fine if within range and i could hear them
it was nice listening to weather radio alsoi bought two of these for my excavating company so we can communicate with our trucks that have cb radios
we have been using them for a week now and so far i am pleased
however we ordered some offbrand lapel mics that did not work so now we are going to try and get some cobra lapel mics and hopefully they will work
only complaint would be that we need to wrap the bottom half of the radio with electrical tape to cover the power and charging port to protect them from dirtthis cb radio is identical to the model sold as the hh road trip
for a dollar more the latter model also includes a magnetic rooftop antenna with coax cable
the radios are the same down to the model number inside the package the manual and the fcc type certificationi think amazon should tell users that the hh road trip includes an antenna for the same cost and is the same product
otherwise they should reduce the price of this package to account for the lack of a magnetic mount antennai used this radio for a  mile road trip out west this past spring
the radio worked very well when i took the time to learn all the features and to efficiently use them
if you use the car adapter to plug into your cars cigarette lighter it will give you some annoying humming that can drive you crazy if you let it
i would highly recommend using this along with a car top antenna
the range is decent and is very helpful on interstate travel
the weather radio really helped prepare me for a springtime snowstorm when driving through wyomingi was able to raise a couple folks on radio checks so it works
im not an avid radio operator so i may not be the one to review this itemthe cb works greati do however suggest having an external whip antenna if you want better performance you do not need it thoughthe targus stowaway turns your visor into an ultracompact mobile office
the stowawys sizeboth in the fullsize utility mode and the folded storage modefar surpasses the gotype
the stowaway is about the same size as the visor in the bifold case when folded for travel
when  expanded though it really does become a fullsized keyboard with plenty  of palmspecific options like quotdonequot quotcancelquot and  quotokquot keyswhile it can be used on your lap it does help to  have a firm surface under it
i find it much sturdier than the gotype
and  do not worry about breaking it
im more concerned about damaging my visor  than i would ever be of damaging the stowawaywhile it doesnt have a  builtin hotsync ability like the gotype the point of having a keyboard  is to have rapid data entry away from your computer
if you were at your  computer and could hotsync you certainly wouldnt be using a smaller  keyboard like the gotype
sthe stowaway is certainly the best external  keyboard on the market but at the price you really have to be committed to  being away from your computer and have the need to enter a lot of data  before the dividends offset the investmentthis keyboard is impressive
though it is not practical for constant use it is certainly the answer if you have large amounts of text to enter
i would not jot down a phone number or address with it but if im copying a recipe taking notes or writing email its perfect
even though i have a great and small laptop there are times when i want to be typing in thirty seconds and be doneand certainly not reforming graffiti gaffes or trying to remember punctuation
the software is easy to install and you get the hang of connecting it to your visor after a few times
its particularly useful for third party applications that dont have a pc desktop interface my checkbook program for example would otherwise have me do my weeks collection of receipts with the stylusfor the keyboardpro full size comfortable responsive has a nice faint clicking sensation
attaches easily
truly compact
some function keys
flawless in my experience integration with the rest of the machinenot glitchy and doesnt seem to drain the batteries
kinda slick to whip it out in a meeting roomcon it cant sit right on your lap really
you have to put it on something flatfor the softwarepro easy installation
some nice controls for repeat rate etc
compatible with nonkeyboard use of the visor whenever you prefer
if its in the keyboard the machine knows ituse of the stylus is not at all compromisedcon you still have to use the stylus
you cant tab between fields choose items from popup menus scroll through lists or other things those of us who are truly keyboarddependent have come to expecti think that this works very well but it can be a bit picky to connect to your visor its not really hard but lining up the unit and the keyboard requires some maneuvering sometimes and i can see how you could just knock off the connecting pins  i used it a few times on my lap instead of a desk and it doesnt seem to to lie stragt now even on a desk
i am not sure if its cause i used it on a not flat surface or after time it just doesnt connect as effecently and isnt as flatbut it is a bit of a pain  also i had a time when i had to call the support line who were very helpful by the way  it seems that it works best if you connect the unit when the visor is off and than turn it onso the drivers loadsometimes the drivers will not load if you connect the keyboard to a visor that is on  it seems if the visor is on and you connect sometimes the keyboard wont work and you wont know why this seems a bit picky and a reel pain in a meetingon the other hand it is way easier than using graffitior the on screen keyboard it makes the visor much more useful for taking notes putting in dataaddressesetc  there are many more keyboards on the market now than when i bought mine and i would check them all outbut besides these few things mine has been working well for as long as they have been outthe usb hotsync cable is a quick and dirty way to sync your visor with a desktop or mobile computer without worrying about a cradle
the cable plugs directly into your computers usb port and connects to the visors sync  port easilyrated at  stars because ive had difficulty with my cable  disconnecting a few times if the visor is moved during the sync operation
if you do choose this product be sure not to disturb the visor while the  sync is in progress to avoid any loss of communicationhaving this cable will allow you to hotsync not only with your laptop but to any pc where you might not have a spare cradle laying around windows  supports usb
i use thisin conjunction with my handspring backup module
i use the module when im away from a pc and use this cable when i dont feel like carrying around a cradle with me all the time
a must for the mobile elite
my only recommendation would be for handspring to integrate this cable with a charger into one packagethis is a great tool for sharing a dsl or cable connection
my only quirk is that a little more documentation should be put in regarding setup where a server is involved
everything looked like it was set up right but it wouldnt work
fortunately a friend of mine was savvy enough to rig it up and make it runthat aside it is reliable
once it was up and running i had no issues save file transfer in aim
workin on that oneid recommend it for anyone who already has a network switch and doesnt want to replace it
if your going to start a network and share braodband id go with the  or  port version
those ports can run out fastreturned my netgear and bought the linksys worked on the first try using dhcp  the  firmware did not allow port forwarding so i backed it down to  and it port forwards just fine tech support was helpful as well and did not have to wait  hours to get hung up onthe oneport variety means you have to have a separate hub but i prefer keeping things modular so if one piece breaks you only have to replace that one piece
some of the other brands offer more functionality like a print server that some people may need
i just care about the built in dhcp server and firewallive got a couple of digital cameras
an olympus  and an olympus   really like them  they work well and the macro function of the  really helps my ebay biz
but they are big cameras  they have to reside in a large case  they need all kinds of batteries  in short theyre a pain to lug aroundi found the canon on closeout at compusa for a crazy low price
should have bought every one they had but lacking the bucks i picked up one intending to play with it for a day or two and then sell it off at ebay for a nice profitim still using it  months later
i cant bring myself to sell it
ive never opened the included mb cf card as its stupid for canon to even include a card if theyre going to put one in that small  it wont hold the equivilent of a roll of film
there are lots of sellers of cf cards now priced right
i put a mb chip in that cost me less than ive read some complaints about the battery
i dont think those folks know what they are talking about
as long as you are not messing around too much reviewing photos  the included battery will last you all day
if not  get a converter and plug your battery in your car for a quick recharge
no big dealthe lens is a bit slow  and it really doesnt have the reach id like  but thats fixable
 buy an adapter and one of his monocular lens add ons
works very well but its a bit of a pain to focus
once you figure out how it all works together you can get photos of birds in the tops of trees with no trouble
better buy a little tripod thoughthe best photos are taken by the camera you have at the time you need to take the photo
this camera and the others in its line are pocketable and built to be hauled around
this is the camera that will take the photo you would have missed
the only reason i put this camera at  stars is the little mb cf card that comes with it
if theyd put a  id given  starsive had this camera just over  years and it takes pretty good pictures
the size is tiny which i love
we bought extra memory and a backup battery so we can use one while the other is charging
sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side but im able to fix that using the photoshop  adjust levels function  not sure how a person would do that without photoshop thoughspeaking of software the program that came with the camera  years ago was horrible but theyve since upgraded to a program thats decent which you can download from the canon website and likely they provide the latest software with current purchasesim not surethe normal zoom works well but when you get into the digital zoom everything gets fuzzyboth the viewscreen and the actual pictures are big blurs
so i just dont use that featureoverall its a decent buyi was looking for a compact rugged i carry it hiking skiing boating etc camera which is easy to use
i wanted standard memory expansion cf cards macro mode and if possible a waterproof housing for kayaking
this is the only camera with all these capabilities
even with the waterproof housing it is small
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you dont need to fuss with a lens cap
the metal housing seems very rugged
turnon to readytoshoot is about  seconds
id give it   stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes
for example in auto mode you cant use the flash redeye reduction you must be in manual mode for that
the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds
you need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc
the macro mode works well although it takes some practice since the camera doesnt clearly indicate when it cant focus
the whiteled backlit lcd is very bright and crisp even in sunlight and relatively easy on the battery
the panorama modes are wonderful
buy at least two batteries and youll never run out in the field
highres photos take  mbytes each so you want a cf card sized accordingly
its so small and light even with a spare battery you really can take it anywhere
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance but there is no manual focus or manual exposure
x means really good cropped x prints and acceptable xs
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact
its a little jeweli bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it or have already bought itits size
it is amazingly small its hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera
i take it with me everywhereliterally it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket and i dont have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable
there is also a small covering for the lens so you need not worry that the lens will get scratchedthe picture quality surprised me when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be goodbut i was wrong
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding taking its size and price into considerationhowever i do have a few things to complain aboutfirst off the battery
this camera uses a lithium battery i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas stationthere is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there
not only is it inconvenient but also the battery life span is short
the longest ive had it work was about  hour and  minutes
this isnt uncommon in cameras though just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries you should be fineanother problem i had with this camera was the zoom function
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms inwrong
very wrong
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little resulting in a noisy startupthe flash is very weak
really dissapointing
if you are inside you cant be any farther away then  feet in a lit roomthe last problem i found with this camera was the macro function
the autofocus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject
to make matters work there is no manual override to overcome this problem
the focus is great though if you are not taking a macro shotthese are all the flaws i found in the camera its not my first choice in cameras i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times then this is a great camera choicei have had a canon digital elph for several months and am thrilled with the camera
while it has its limitations  lack of a good zoom anemic flash and hardtosee viewfinder it takes great pictures and is exceptionally easy to tote around
i have not used the highest resolution mode and have been quite satisfied with x prints printed on my hp  or sent to ofoto
the panorama mode can produce spectacular results and by the way is an easy way around the limitations of the cameras  megapixel resolution
if you play around with the size of your panoramas you  can print pictures larger than x that will be as sharp as your xs
if you dont have a large format printer use a printing service for that special photo
i have been blown away by the instant feedback i get from a digital camera and the elph has made photography a lot more fun
often its the only camera i carry but i still lug around an aps slr with a big zoom when im doing serious photography
i have been rather surprised how well some handheld night shots come out
ive gotten pictures at dusk that are reasonably sharp and show much more detail than i would expect from the cameras iso  rating
it is essential to have a second battery as your battery will always run out when you need it
i use lexar cf cards they come with a usb cable and transfer pictures x faster than the camera
set the camera in quotmanualquot mode which is still basically automatic as it allows you to choose all the flash modes available
in addition set the camera to remember the last settings or you will have to put it into manual mode each time you turn it on
unlike a lot of digital cameras on the market the elph is easy to use and carry and feels like a camera
its menus are a little complex but people who dont find features that are there and complain about difficulty of use just havent studied the manual
i have recommended the camera to my friends on this basis  in  years it will be obsolete but it will still fit in your pocket and you will still be using it for snapshotsthe good  small size durableseeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramasthe bad  short battery life about  shots with flash and lcd on  thankfully it comes with a recharger no way to take x pictures in automatic mode or if this is possible manuals that dont tell you how to do itthe ugly  adobe photodeluxe software  utterly useless as it only saves in a proprietary format and even if it did save in usable formats it just doesnt do very much and it does it poorlythe conclusion  high wow factor great toy for the technogeek but get a second battery and some better softwareif compact size is your highest priority in a megapixel camera the canon powershot s digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design
the ss image quality rates in the middle of its class but it can still be a reasonable choice for students families or small businesses looking for an ultraportable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery packthe jury rated the ss prints in the middle of the pack but its overall image quality results fell at the low end of the midlle for megapixel cameras
color balance measured better than average with a noticeable blue cast in images shot under outdoor lighting conditions
though the s only offers centerweighted metering we overcame a tough indoorexposure situation by using both exposure and focus locks
other megapixel cameras offer a more powerful zoom lens and more imagecontrol settingsthe flash worked fine for shots taken at the maximumrated distance under indoor lighting conditions but it overexposed images taken inside at the minimumrated macro distance
we were impressed with the sharpness of macro images captured outdoors with no flash
standard shots taken without flash under outdoor lighting conditions showed slight underexposure but accurate color
the ss panorama mode worked effectively as did its burst mode in which we captured one shot per second at the highresolution and highcompression settings and three shots every  seconds at the highresolution and lowcompression settingsthe s feels balanced in its shiny stainless steel case and flattens to a smooth flat box when the lens retracts an integrated cover protects the lens when retracted
external control buttons are minimal because you adjust most of the setting through menus but unfortunately the relatively small lcd and small menu font present an operational challengethe ss bright lcd displays a graphical menu system which attempts simplicity but misses the mark and leads you back to the user guide to clarify navigation and features at every turn
it can be frustrating to use the small lcd to take advantage of the cameras effective panorama mode but better that than using the viewfinder in this mode
the s can be ready to capture your first shot in  seconds and subsequent shots every  secondscompared to others in its class the s is well equipped and designed with both a usb interface and convenient access to batteries and media when the camera is mounted on a tripod
the included software bundles together a valuable mix of applications particularly the effective imagestitching software for panoramamode shotsthis is my second digital camera but im much more impressed with the canon s digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me which is great considering im an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive
i especially like the way that zoombrowser ex lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any  degree panorama shots
id suggest that you not only buy this camera but the case for it and an extra battery pack
my only complaint and the reason i gave it  stars instead of  is that the oncamera controls arent as intuitive as they should be
ive often struggled to get something to work the way i want it and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time
other than that i love this camera
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfecti bought this little guy a few weeks back and i have to saythat i never had so much fun with a new toy as this
you willdefinitly appreciate the small size
you can take it anywhere withyou unlike other bulky cameras and capture every moment of yourlifethis is my first digital camera ive owned so i wantedemphasis some points to all my felow novice photographers that otherreviewers may have already pointed out  theres no intermediateresolution quality setting its either the normal  x  thebetter  x  or the best super fine  x
which ofcourse means the better quality pictures you want to take the morestorage space you need
i recommend a m or better compact flashcard  buy an extra battery
the batter will last around  or sopictures using a flash with the lcd turned off but if you plan ongoing on vacation you will definitly need one
image quality isinconsistent
this could be my fault but under the camera automaticsetting some pictures come out way too dark red or blurry
this isspecially true when taking pictures indoors
but daylight outdoorpictures are truely beautiful
 you need to hold the camera verysteady when taking pictures due to its small size
otherwise pictureswill turn out blurryoverall i love this new toy
i woulddefinitly recommend it to first time digital camera owners
it willtake you some time to learn to operate it but after that it will be apiece of cake
enjoythis wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photoquality printer with photo quality paper
it will not replace your highend mm slr but its a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshotsthe only negative comments i have about it is that i personally find the small controls hard to use my yearold eyes have trouble seeing something this small
i have had some annoying problems with the software on my windows  machine basically i have to uninstall the driver everytime i disconnect the camera or the computer will look for it not find it and crash the next time i restart the machine
i would not recommend this camera for the naive computer useri dont believe this camera is still available
but if you can find one you might like to get it
its still one of the smallest mp digital cameras on the market and absolutely one of the bestbuilt most stylish cameras everif you believe as i do that the utility of a camera is inversely proportional to its size you cant help but love this camera
i take it with me almost everywhere ev
