i like the product but the one thing that kinda bites is the fact that the camera is on a pivot from the frame and the cord is heavy which will make positioning it difficultwell years ago i saw the sony surround headphones mdrds and thought they would be pretty cool
the price scared me stiffnow you have these and the sennheiser rs  with similar praise and criticismfor me the hiss was annoying but after laying back to watch my movie i was able to quotretunequot the hiss to a decent level then the movie drowned out the rest
im not sure how much if a surround effect there was i forgot to test that but the headphones could play action scenes pretty wellfor the prices that theyre available for with included nimh batteries its hard to argue against themim keeping mine though im hoping to compare to the sennheisers soonhow is it that cordless phones are worry free in mhz up to ghz and we cant get decent headphonespros very comfortable for extended listening
excellent to outstanding sound quality
excellent operation when in same area of transmitter
spare battery so a charged one is always ready
excellent product supportcons rating of    ft reception one important consideration in purchase may be possible however in my situation it isnt there
with the transmitter located in my den lower level clipping occurs in the upper rooms less than    ft away
reception is problematic also outdoors  again less than  feet from the transmitter
reception depends largely on your homes construction obstacles between the transmitter and headphones other devices operating on the same frequency  so wearing these boys while mowing the lawn just isnt going to be a pleasant experienceconstruction is adequate if the phones are handled somewhat carefully
the area where the ear pieces are attached and allow them to swivel is the weak link
this area is really small for the task and one broke from the simple act of putting them on and taking them off
thats why i can comment on the companys product support they replaced them sans any chargeprice
fairly high especially if the range is a primary factor
in my case only able to use these phones while in the same area as the transmitter i probably could have made a cheaper choice and received comparable resultsi bought this lens strictly for shooting stars
good not great value for the money
there arent many wide lenses out there this fast
it works well for stars
im able to get  more stops of shutter speed compared to my f lenses
a big plus in my opinion
on the down side this lens vignettes badly at anything wider than f
not a huge issue when the scene is mostly dark and i typically add vignetting to some degree in post processing
the af system is very clunky
flip a switch and the focus barrel
again not a huge deal for me as i keep this lens on manual focus for shooting starsi dont do much wide angle photography but ive had this lens for years and took it on a hike last summer with a canon d mark ii
it has good center sharpness but even at f the corners are somewhat smeary
this is perfectly acceptable for a mm lens at this pricethe lens has none of the warmgolden color that older sigma lenses had like the mm
it has bright even color and contrast like a canon lens
it does have sigmas klutzy two step focus motor system
to switch between af and mf you have to flip a switch that is physically connected to the mechanical gears and then slide the focus ring to the correct position
failure to do this can put stress on the focus gears and possibly damage themshooting wide open with a fast lens like this can create some interesting effects
it was great for picking out a single flower while exaggerating the size of everything else in the field which is out of focus and fills most of the framei bought a used copy of this lens  perhaps that is part of the problem but i am less than thrilled with iti like the fact that it is fast
i love photographing in low light
but even in medium light this lens struggles to focus and it is not sharp at all
my mm kit lens kicks its butt for iq
it is one of those lenses that you use only on rare occasions and mostly leave it on a shelf at home
i will probably not use this one very much as i have several old manual focus lenses that are far better that this lens
from now on sigma is a lens that i will avoid
i know some people have had good luck with their lenses but there are a lot of people out there complaining about the inconsistent quality
its just not worth the risk to mei am a medium to high end user of photographic equipment
i purchased this lens for the speed of the lens and its ability to function in low light
the lens does work well in low light but i have not been overly pleased with the focus of the images
the lens is a little heavy as well
i like using this as my walkaround lens when taking street scenes
the focusing may be user error but i have read some reviews regarding the recalibrating of this model by the manufacturerideal for dx but not so good on fxnormally when you shoot wide angle youre interested in the whole image sharpness and not only the center
this lens did not quite work out for me on my d because of the corner softness
i ended up replacing it with the new nikon mmthis product really doesnt perform as well as i had expectedlimited range and functionality
were disappointedin one swift stroke apple computer has sought to redefine the portable digital music player
with the ipods gb of space you can tote around hundreds of digital songs and nonmusic files too
what can i say
its ultracool ultralight  oz and youll want one the second you pick it up in your hands
the lcd display is top notch and the playback controls are as simple as they get
with the ipods fast firewire connection you can download an entire cd onto the device in about  to  seconds
moreover the ipods battery is recharged through the firewire port another plus
still the gadget has its drawbacks first compatibility
only firewire mac users are able to use the ipod
also there is no record function and the price is steep
if youre a firewire mac user and portable music is a daily routine then the ipod is a must
if not admire it shed some tears and move onhelloi purchased these speakers at amazoncom for a knockdown holiday sale price of  oct  they came in today and i tried them with some basic techno metal and rock music
the sound quality is good
also the set up was a breeze just plugged in the basic items to each other and the best part was that the power cord doesnt have a large bulky adapter which would have hogged space at the power outleti also wish the speakers not the woofer could be of a bit higher wattage
the rms root mean square power is indeed below average
but note that rms power is not the only consideration when purchasing the speakers quality factor q ratings and fidelity are very much more important than any thing else
a good example would be those tiny bose speakers which deliver absolutely divine and crisp musicaddendum i recently got a huge home theatre system watts  sony
after listening to that this speaker system sounds like an orphan crying in the scottish moors
distant and not very pronouncedlook if you are not crazy about too much sound then this unit is good when priced below otherwise go for a higher wattage system
and also go   surround sound systems you will enjoy the difference every single daybrackets are good but the screws that attach the bracket to the speaker was not the right size
they were to fat and would not thread in
i had screws so i used mine
other then that they work welli used these to mount my accoustimass speakers in our new family room
they look good enough and arent distracting but for the price theyre just not all that impressive
no bose items are cheap and some like this one push the envelope approaching over priced but they work fine and as advertised
im satisified with the product but i do feel i paid a bit of an unnecessay premium for themfirst this product is twice as much directly from bose even though its exactly the same
so even though its much cheaper here even at this price i dont think this product is very good
it does what it says it will do but it is poorly designed and not very elegant considering it is holding up  speakers
it even has ugly gaps above and below where you can kind of see the mounting plate
it works but is cheap looking and has horrible directions
surprised bose would support this producti believe i have this laying somewhere it was the wrong bracket for the  unit speakers didnt fit so what can i tell you i have no idea what these are forbut i wont say anything bad or good about them as i dont use them nor need them my mistake i guess i thought they would fit my units speakersbecause they are bose wall mounts they do work
getting the wires thr the walls is a pain
also think they are way too expensive for what they arei was a firm believer in writing things down on paper  my dayrunner was always with me and worked well for me for many years i took the step a few  years ago to a pda my husband bought it for me for xmas and it was amazing how much i learned to rely on it and use itexcellent way to keep track of addresses phone numbers and organize your busy schedule both professional and personalunfortunately there are some drawbacks to this unit that i would like to share with you and when i get a new one i think this xmas ill be upgrading
i will know what is important to me in a pda no backlight this is annoying when you can not see your screen in a car or somewhere else a backlight would be greatnot compatible with my mac  i have a pc at home but at  work we are on macs and i can not synchronize my schedule electronically at work nor can i hotsync at workwhen your battery runs out all of your information is lost forever
this was a shocker
i had hotsynched a few months ago so i was able to reload my old out of date information back to my clie but it was pretty awful since all of the new appointments were not in the pda nor were updated phone numbers and addressesthe buttons get pressed when it is in my purse since the stick up slightly they get pressed when in my purse and then it runs the battery downit locks up  i would say it will freeze up and lock up about once every  months
that is frustrating and has no apparent reason for doing thisi try to charge the battery every few days so that helps with the memory lossi have found i really do enjoy having all of my information at my fingertips at all times and this helps me manage my many meetings and events at work and home  and now that i know i will actually use and enjoy this device it is time to upgrade to color backlit display and mac compatible software
im looking at the zire  it has a digital camera but not quite as well as it says
it will carrying the signal from my iphone to the receiver and will play at a comfortable listening level but you wont be rocking out with this the distortion starts at a fairly moderate volumea good stop gap until i finally make that jump to a bluetooth radio for the cari bet the quality is really great except it doesnt work in my car tapes player
i have a volkswagen jetta and it is not compatible with this tape
other tapes have worked but if it works its great for the pricei bought this adapter for myzune hd
it arrived earlier than expected so i didnt have my zune with me at the time i received the adapter
a while after i inserted the adapter into the cassette player in my car i found out that there is a lose mechanical part in the adaper that makes noise when the road condition is not perfect which is almost everywhere at pittsburgh
unfortunately that became my first impression about the deviceim not sure its a trick i didnt know or what but apparently if you want to have quality sound you need to tune the volume of your player to the highest and then have a subnormal setting on your car stereo
if you have your car stereo at the normal setting and tune your player volume accordingly the sound quality is terrible
from time to time i feel like the songs dont sound the same as those i burned into cds but most of the time as long as the volume on the player goes to the maximum the sound quality is decenti guess i expected a little bit more from this adapter though in general it does do the jobi bought this product confidently expecting clear audio without any feedback but that unfortunately is not the case when you want to listen to your music on louder levels
the background fuzzfeedback noise is noticeable and it bugs the crap out of megranted it is less noticeable after adjusting volume levels on either your car stereo or your ipod so dont tell me to do thatbut you cant get around it when you want to listen to your music beyond a certain threshold of volume which i find restricting
you have to constantly juggle with the volume of either the stereo or your ipod to reach that perfect balance and i find that highly inconvenientother than that it does its job but it looks like a pretty cheap product that i wouldnt want to pay more than 
i am less than satisfied with this purchasei bought this when i got a car that only had a tape deck and i wanted to play my ipod through the stereo
the sound quality is not that great but that is understandable
probably a little better than one of those fm transmitters we used to have to use back in  i hated those things
anyway it did the job for a few months until i saved up enough scratch to put a ipodready stereo in my car
i then passed it on to my dad but he reported that it stopped working shortly afterwardi originally got this for my mercedes and the quality was somewhat ok since then i upgraded my audio system to full aftermarket
i tested it out on my wifes toyota and the quality was horrible read unlistenable
if this is the best one out there i think there is something to ask of itits a decent product in that the audio is great in quality but in my  toyota camry it makes a loud clicking sound every second which is hard to drown out with the music or whateverit works but noise
you can hear the mechanic noisenot the audio noise from the device
the sound quality is okperhaps i got the random statistical quality control failure but mine often squeaks and its annoying
i was drawn to the sony name brand with a reputation for quality but im disappointed with the performance of my particular unit
i suspect that if i played the music loud enough it might drown out the squeak but thats not the norm for me and its particularly disappointing when listening to soft music
that said it does function and its hard to argue with the price so with that in mind i give it a fair ratingperiodically makes a horrible grinding noise
its a mechanical noise coming from the tape deck not a sound quality issue
sound quality is a bit muddy and flat but i suspect it is probably par for the course with a tape adapter
all my mps are encoded at various quality levels so volume fluctuation from song to song is a bit of a problem  more so than when i have used aux in adapters in the pasti actually fixed the grinding noise by tearing the thing open and removing the tape part
no idea why that worked but it gets the job done now and i dont have to go look for another onepurchased this item as it is from sony
in less than a month the adapter started to make a loud whirring mechanical noise in my cars cassette deck
other cassettes dont do the same
getting a replacement in the hopes that i had a defective itemthey are nice but they were slightly bentsmashed when i got them
i had to twist them a little
they are very light weightthis little cassette converter has fair sound but it isnt great
it seems to chop off the high treble and lowest bass
it has quiet operation and is easy to usewhile this gives me  connecting in a  car with a tape deck it has a little feedback and the letter s in my music is a little heavy and nail scratchy
my last  dollar unit had no problem with the letter s but it had a problem with working without static so this sony winsi bought two cassette adapters one from sonythis one and one which costs less from cobythe coby is more versatile as it fits into two types of player
the coby also has a coiled leadotherwise to my ear and eye for quality they are very similarboth my cars came with tape players which i dont use so this unit was perfect for me to route the audio from external units to a vehicles stereo systemi use this for my garmin nuvi  and zune without having to run any wires behind the dash
it doesnt provide any control of the external accessories ie
i still have to use the nuvis touch screen or the zunes touchpad
now all my songs and playlists are in one mp player that goes with methe only caveat is that the stereo will be in tape mode all the time
so when hooked up to a gps one cant listen to the radiocds and have the music interrupted when the gps issues turn instructionsit worked out good enough to get another for the other carthis thing works just fine for what it does provide a way to hook an mp player into a car cassette deck
the sound quality absolutely beats an fm transmitter
that said the device itself makes a certain amount of noisenot much and ive had similar devices that were louderbut you can definitely hear it if the audio youre playing is quiet and your cars noise doesnt overpower iti use this for listening to audio books off my mp player and its a good solution for this application
my only complaint is that the tape unit clicks while it is turning which can get a bit annoying at low volumes
but for less than  i dont know that you can expect crystal clear audio
overall it solves my problem listening problemoh and i ran into the low volume problem when using it in a friends car  i only had to change the direction of the tape deck and suddenly i had loud volumethis cassette adaptor couldnt be easier to use for playing music through car or stereo speakers
cut the adaptor out of its plastic packing stick it into a cassette deck plug it into the headphone jack of your portable music player and voilagrave music
its really as simple as that
the adaptor requires no assembly or adjustments to work perfectly right out of the boxthis device works only with cassette decks that load with the tape to one side not front loading as the cable that connects to your portable device comes out of a short side so check your cassette deck before purchasing this
the best part is that it works silently allowing your music to sound as clear as it should
you can adjust the sound through your stereo or through the portable device itselfive used this both with a regular ipod and an ipod mini with great success
its much better and cheaper than buying one of the fm stereo broadcasting devices because its never dependent upon available airwaves and never needs retuning as you move from one radio zone to anotherhighly recommended if you plan on listening to digital music in the car
as long as your car has the correct kind of cassette deck and your portable device has a standard headphone jack it will work without a hitchupdate to review several months later  this adaptor started making a clicking sound and occasionally makes a terrifying electronic buzz that nearly scares me into accidents
it did spend the winter in the car although my garage never gets below freezing
unfortunately i cant tell if this noise problem is because of my old car stereo or because of some electronic defect in the adaptor that cropped up after heavy useupdate  when i first wrote this review reviewers were not allowed to edit the number of stars so this remained a fivestar review until today
although i no longer use this product it worked great for several months five stars but then developed the noise noted above  star
i gave it an average of three starswe bought this for a hour round trip vacation and it worked flawlessly for the probably  hours we used it in total
we were impressed
that said upon returning home and trying to use it on trips around town it has now started making rattling noisesas they all eventually seem to at one time or another
i dont want to turn up the music loud enough to overcome the rattling so it has gone in the trashthe antenna works ok  however it is not very good for using in a city dwellingi purchased these speakers for use as my side channels in my  surround sound system
i was surprised at how easy they were to install
id rate my handiness skill as amaturish at best but a friend and i were able to get these installed in the ceiling and working in under  hr
the hardest part was cutting the hole in the ceiling
the speakers come with a cardboard stencil to draw the line for the cut and the design of the speaker itself is pretty forgiving in case youre not so hot with the drywall saw
once the hole was in the ceiling the speakers go in and after a quick twist of the screwdriver theyre inthey sound pretty good for ceiling speakers and they definitely serve my purpose as side channels
i probably wouldnt opt to use them as my primary speakers but theyre not bad
im considering buying another set or two to set up a whole home system for music and install them in the bedroom and the officepros ease of installation they look great and sound pretty goodcons theyre not going to replace your main speakers and although they say that theyre paintable painting the grill requires you to use spray paint so not to gum up the grill
this may make it difficult to match your existing paint
i didnt paint mine but they still look really good in their original white and match my light switch and outlet coversgood enough for the bedroom but sound does not travel well
bass is very weak even on a decent denon receiverfor the last  years ive been using a set of polk rm surround speakers and a polk pws sub to power my home theater setup
this has worked ok but i recently got the itch to make some upgrades and it seemed like a good idea to get inceiling speakers for surrounds instead of having speakers suspended from the ceiling like i had beforeoriginally i was going to buy a pair of the tci speakers as surrounds but when i saw the price of these rcis on amazon i just couldnt resistonce the speakers arrived i waited until my wife took the kids to swimming lessons so i could get these installed while she was gone to surprise her she is really happy about getting rid of the hanging speakers
since i had already run wires when i installed the previous speakers putting these up couldnt have been easier
i traced the included template with a pencil and then cut out the hole using a jig saw
after packing the area above the speaker with insulation i just popped them in and screwed them downas a side note i didnt have any problems with tight grills that many users have reported
they popped right off both speakers using a safety pin and went on just as easilyanyway i had completely installed both speakers and cleaned up my mess before the wife and kids showed back up from swimming lessons
it was about  minutes before anyone realized i had even done anythingunfortunately after listening to them for a couple of days against my previous smaller rm satellites  i decided that they just werent cutting it
honestly these speakers dont even hold there own vs the sats with  drivers in tiny enclosures
they sound kind of hollow with the empty space behind them
they were installed on the first floor of a story house so they dont have empty attic above them but there is a lot of hollow ceiling between the floors
lucky for me the uninstall went just as smoothly as the original install
i replaced these with the tci surrounds that i had originally been looking at and the difference is amazing
the new tcis are the best sounding speakers in my setup right now  although im not done upgrading the other speakers yet
they also balance perfectly after running through the setup on my receiveroverall i would only recommend these speakers as satellites if you are using really small speakers for your centerrightleft
if you ever plan to listen to music then skip these  and i wouldnt ever use them in the front of a home theater setup
the lci speakers do cost more although i found a great price on sale but i think they are worth it when it comes to sound quality  especially for something that will be installed in the ceilingif you have realistic expectations for these speakers i have the rci youll be happy
they are a little weak when it comes to producing bass but otherwise they have decent sound quality
if your looking for something with a bit more bass check out my review of the jbl spcii way speakers they are significantly betterinstalled these into my ceiling for a  setup  using polk monitor s in the front with cs center channel
since my attic has blown insulation i built enclosuers  cubic feet each that drop between the rafters with openings just big enough so that i can still mount the speakers on the dry wall
i only notice the speakers once or twice during a movie  helicpoters gun shots etc
but other than that i cant even tell there anything therespeakers where easy to install grill come off with little effort but just not much sound coming from them even after adjusting the surround lr speaker levels on my reciever  maybe the ms are just too over powering for these surrounds
im glad i didnt go with the tcs  i cant image them being any much better than thesei bought these speakers to replace a speaker that had started to go out
i had a set of infinity ers speakers on my patio  of them started getting static  years old so i did some research and bought these polk speakers
i bought the pair just incase the other infinity goes out
ease of installation was perfect it fit into the existing hole and i had it in place and playing music in less than  minutes
the problem is that it is very thin sounding compared to the infinity
i left the working infinity in place and installed  polk in the broken infinitys place
you can definitely tell the difference between the  speakers
the infinity is much louder and has more base
clarity on the polk is good i just wish it had more substance
as they are outside speakers i am not too concerned im sure my neighbors will appreciate the quieter sounds but if i was installing them inside for my tv or stereo i would definitely spend more money and choose another brand or style
delivery was excellent i bought them on monday morning and they were delivered on tuesday nightfor the low price of under  these are superb for a single purpose
for us that purpose is soft quiet background music in a formal dining room that is not used very often
if you intend to play louder or try to fill a room or section of your house these speakers will not do well
they get muddy at higher volumes and do not have good bassbut for a small space where you only need background music these cant be beat for the price
once your hole is cut these install easily
cutting the hole is a project in and of itself
be carefuli bought this thinking that i would never need another remote control
however this unit is limited in its functionality
i guess thats why they are stopping production and making the other one
the product is big  which is a disadvantage
also the screen is horrible
unlike the pronto whos screen is great you cannot read this screen without the backlight on
also i had trouble with my sony av receiver
it took me a while but i finally figured it out
before i bought it i thought that its usefullness would outweigh its size however for me it is not the case
i am not a big fan of the buttons and the size
also it cannot hold enough macro functions for my system
like i said before this is getting a little old for the times if i were you i would return this item and get the phillips pronto its  online and can never become obsolete due to its ability to update firmware
its a lot smaller and had a much better screen
if all you need is something basic to control your entire system this is fine but i would shell the extra  bucks and go with the better smaller pronto
another thing that i should note is that the sony remote does not have backlit quothard buttonsquot the rubber buttons on the front
the pronto doestdk makes great tapes but this tape really does not define them
there was no problem with them but it is not impressive
it is no where near the better tdk tapes and jvc tapesthe polk website gives more realistic frequency informationthe hz  khz is a little deceptive
notice the lower db limit is hzfor example the  inch speakersoverall frequency response  hz  khzlower db limit  hzupper db limit  khznominal impedance   ohmsrecommended amplifier power     wchannelefficiency   dbi made a mistake in purchasing the wrong size of battery but the company made the return quick and possible
aside from my mistake the batteries delivered to my house was not encased like in the picture causing a minor doubt if the product is new or not
the initial image of the product is a little misleading
otherwise they were easy to return
next time i would buy batteries that are enclosed in the original packaging just in casei thought since this is a wellknown brand and has a list price of  that the device would be made of heavy duty high quality materials
it works fine and seems reasonably designed but it is quite light which is good for portability except for the fact that you dont really need to move it around much and feels cheap
so i expected it to be made of heavier components
it feels like a  surge protector not a  surge protector
however i have not opened it up to see its innards and they may be quite goodit hasnt failed yet
in the end all that matters is how it deals with a surge
ive used it for my home theater for  months so farseems well built but havent seen it doing anything yet other than resetting it self all of a sudden for no reasonthis is a cheap basic splitter
i had no problems with it but when the cable guy came to look at something he ripped it out and gave me a new good one
this one is not recommended for cable modems and causes a lot of distortion apparentlythe splitter is completely flat meaning you have to screw on your coax cables before screwing the splitter into a wall or beam using the screw eyelets
the same goes for removing a coax cable you have to unscrew the splitter from the wall before unscrewing the coax cable
for most people this is ok but for me i needed something raised when installed and so i ended up picking up what i needed from the local hardware store
it costed a little more but it also doesnt have the same cheap feeling as this one so im happyi bought this a bit ago because i was having problems with my cable modem disconnecting during downloads and since i had tried different coax cablesnetwork cablesrouters i figured this would be the last step to tryfor cable tv it worked greatchannels come in perfectlycable modem synced up and worked and all seemed well until it started to disconnect again on downloadsi happened to find an old splitter in my closet that i thought i had lost and now everything works perfectlyit so happens to be another rca splitteri am not really sure what the problem is with my original splitter from the cable company and this one but just to warn anyone with a cable modem that if you experience problems this could be itdoes the job but flimsily built
connecting wires are too short to fit most of the antennas
connectors detach from the wires too easilyneeded a matching transformer for my antenna as the old one in spite of being encased in a weatherproof boot over time got a bit corroded and rustythis one fits and works and seems fine in every waybut it is labeled as an indoor matching transformer on the package
maybe it says that in the description i need to check but i didnt see it when i ordered itat any rate i wrapped the heck out of it with electricians tape and it is working for nowbut if i had known i would have ordered something elseif you want something for indoor use it is oknot very strong or well built but it worked ok wire so flimsy and it easy to break
i have to solder another wires because the wire broken when i tighten to antennathis part is so bad  almost broke yet still works
seems like cheap quality got another wave matching transformer same price but better qualitythis switch works well but its too light
when you want to press any of the buttons you need to do it with two hands or the switch can sometimes slide away from you
the weight of the wires connected behind it keep pulling off the shelf that it sits on
it is reliable and has worked well for the few years ive had it
no problems to reporti used this to hook up dvd player with my old sanyo tv
cable signal also go through it to tv
before i use it the tv signal is clear
after i used it signal of some not all channels became noisy with rolling stripesi just got an onkyo and klipsh  speaker system
 gadge works just fine but i ordered the  gadge just now becasue there is just so much power to push i dont want to choke it with my tiny ga
wire
 this is not pure copperit is copper clad aluminum cca
cost is less but thats because aluminum is cheaper and more resistive than coppersuppliers like monostat and others have quality  copper speaker wire for about x the expense of this
it really is a much better deal unless you are connecting  dollar speakers
if you spent s on your speaker setupdont skimp nowyou dont need monster cables or anything like thatbut pure  copper wire makes a huge differancei premeasured out what i needed for my project and this  foot roll ended up being  feet long
i guess i shouldnt have cut it so close with my measurements
but that extra  feet would have done it
grrrrordered the  feet roll and now i have  extra feet  lolgood quality stuff though it is medium stiffness
and it kinda curls up on stuff not too bad thoughthis wire worked in my simple short run installation
sound quality is probably not affected
however i felt deceived when i discovered that this is not pure copper wire
it is copper clad aluminum
for the best quality look for pure copper wirejust fyi for folks who think copper wires are just pure copper but this is not
this is by volume  copper clad aluminum wires
not like anyone can tell the sound quality differences between full copper and coppercoated wires but i felt the need to put this outhavent used any of it thought would need for speakers but didnt will save for some other time and i am sure the wire will workperhaps it should be made of rated oxygen free copper because with time humidity will generate sulphate on the wire affecting the conductivity and hence the quality of sound
however i bought it for testing speakers and other component performance and will now replace it by a pvc encased and oxygen free copper cable
i guess if you live in a low humidity place it will serve its purpose for long whilethe cable isnt solid its a lot of little wires and you have to twist the end
im sure a lot of people already knew this but this is my first time buying speaker wirei purchased this wire but had the wrong banana plugs for the wire
i initially cursed the wire but the plugs i selected just werent friendly with this gauge of wire
im sure it works just fine but with different banana plugs than i purchasedi didnt have to use it
this spring ill use it  for exterior speakers it is still a good investment as the price of metal goes up and will come in handyin this case you get what you pay for
the wire is brittle and hard to manage without breaking but its usable  if your on a budget this wire will work however im not sure as to the life of it
meaning i doubt it will hold up for any length of time if your installing a high dollar system chances are you wont be reading this but if you are dont waste your time spend the few extra bucksi have used this speaker wire on two different home theater builds
it works well enough for smaller speakers and its cheap but its not the best qualitypros cheap ft rolls at a great price works fine for smaller speakerscons cca copper clad aluminum wire not as good as pure copper wire i ordered  gauge but this wire is  gauge this is misleading and makes the value questionable i would not recommend this wire for large speakers gauge speaker wire probably isnt the best best for my situation but i made it work
the only problem i ran into with this wire is that when stripping the ends some of the copper would stay attached to the sheath when you pull it off
weak copper strands
got it working fine and i was fairly inexpensive so i cant complain too much but im only leaving a  star reviewthe wires are not clearly distinguishable and only have a white line to differentiate the  speaker wires that is difficult to see in imperfect lighting conditions as it blends in with the reflection from the copper wire
i got the speakers hooked up eventually but had to try several a few times to get it righthowever i found it difficult to appreciate the coding
one lead has a white marking on the insulation but its just a faint stripe on one side
if thats ok with you then this is suitable for setups not requiring  gauge or where  gauge might be too bulkyim using this for rearchannel speakers where a lighter gauge wire is acceptable
i use heaver gauge wire for my main speakers
this is also outofsight so there are no appearance considerationsthis wire meets the longpublished longunderstood specifications for wire
works as intendedwhat more can one say on whats essentially a passfail situationas usual shipping was fast the wire is g but feels like g
it was very pliable and shielding was strong was able to wire my car with it and run the wires under the carpet and through some tight corner and it did not nick or broke the core
all in all good wire does what its suppose to dothis is a good price for this speaker wire for the size and length of roll but the issue i had was that i had to pull two sets of wiring through some wire moulding trim in my house and the insulation on this wire seems to be a little thicker than on others
normally i would probably consider this to be a good thing but it made the wire very hard to fit through the moulding and the insulation is also rather grippy and caught on itself and i actually had a piece of it snap off while trying to yank it all the way through
needless to say it broke off down in the moulding so i had to pull it back out and restart it again
now that its in place though seems to carry the signal just fine and sound goodnothing special
just plain ol speaker wire
it did and continues to do its job
my only complaint is that the last  feet of the roll was cut from the rest of the roll
 feet in all but not a continuous  feet
this could have been an issue but i only needed two  foot runs  ft totali ordered this based on all the great reviews it received after needing more than the  feet of pyle  awg speaker wire ended up being  not enough for my project my bad not theirs
i got this product a day early which is great and the quality is fine but for the price i could have gone with  feet of the pyle cable for  instead of the  i paid for this plus the pyle cable is much nicer and finely braided instead of twisted strands and had a thicker casing than the rca
since my project needs to be done in two days i will keep the rca cable as i know it will be adequate
if i had more time i would have returned this product for the other
there is nothing wrong with this product it is just that the other is a bit nicer less cost and all my wiring would match but no one will notice that anywayi needed to run some outdoor speakers to  decks and didnt want to kill a big spool of high dollar phoenix gold  gauge for relatively low wattage speakers so i bought  spools of this stuff
seems a bit thin for  gauge but for outdoor service under protected deck areas i figured it would suffice for the application
pliable insulation but not much meat inside even for  gauge and it is copper clad aluminumnothing more or less then what you pay for
i needed something inexpensive for this job
it did it perfectlyit is a good product and the total size is good for a room measuring around xit is not totally copper its copper clad aluminum to make costs lower
wouldnt recommend it for a hifi system since it lowers the quality levelsthe fact that its gauge means the sound will be clearer due to the low oxygen levels something is great but once again the fact it uses aluminum makes everything a trash for what youre paying fordoes just fine for any ht installation up to  longer than this the cable will loose quality because its lower than  gaugemonoprice has true copper cables thatd work better on a hifi system these are just okayi bought this for some short runs so im not too unhappy with it
when i went to terminate the wire i was surprised to see that the exterior of the wire is copper but thats just a coating the wire is aluminum
it will work but aluminum is much less conductive than copper
im wasting a few watts when i use this cableother than that the cable is easy to work with
its flexible not brittle and the jacket is nice
i didnt measure the spool but theres probably  feet there
finally the  gauge measurement is accurate since thats the setting i use to strip it with my klein strippersin all the product is usable and meets its specs but im disappointed that the wire is not copper
ill use what ive got but wont be buying this product againthe right guage wire for most home theatre systemsyou will need to determine if you need one or two rolls depending on the size of your room and the loction of your speakersgood pricei purchased some  gauge speaker early this spring from best buy and the size of the wire was visibly thicker than this
for my application front and rear speakers in my car this wire will do just fine
i will however use different wire for my subwoofer
on the plus side lots of wire at a very good price
when you shop online once in a while you dont get what you expected
i was disappointed  stars
i do like to shop amazoni got the  gauge ft spool for my new surround speakers
im rating this as  stars as the cable is thinner than the usual  awg that ive used before plus it is more fragile and hard to remove the plastic cover without cutting at least a few copper strands
i was using a cable cutter and it still took me several tries in order to remove the cover without cutting at least   strand
for the rest of my setup i got thisbypnaand im much happier
they are the same price too so i highly recommend the media bridge over the rcai purchased rocket fish wires before and i loved it
since the review was pretty good on this rca wires i decided to try this
i suppose it does what it suppose to do but when i was stripping the end i noticed the copper wires too fragile that they would come off pretty easily
i did not have this issue with any other speaker wires sobut overall it is ok for moneyplastic cover was hard to strip and some wire came along with the plastic when pulled off
cant anything be made with quality when it come from chinanice flexible wire
my only gripe was that the last couple of feet towards the inside of the spool was slightly tarnished
i dont know if it was on the shelf for several years or if moisture contacted it before it was spooled
used it anyway cause i needed every inch of that  feetit works it is wire
speaker wire is wire sound comes out so the wire works
what else is there to sayi dont think there could have been a true  feet of wire on this spool
my room is x feet and allowing an extra  feet of wire from speaker to floor and  more feet at the front to allow me extra wire in case i have to pull my receiver out to hook up something i figured that was  feet but when i cut off that length of wire to run to one rear surround speaker i was about  or  feet short of enough for the second speaker and had to order a second reel of wire to finish the job
still waiting for it to show upoverall i picked this item for two reasons 
it is guage which is essential when running a connecting length greater than  feet
i assumed that rca was one of the higher quality brands to pick
unfortunately i was wrong about the overall quality of the cable
after purchasing this item i realized that it was not solid copper but cca copper clad aluminum
i used this wire strictly for my two rear speakers so i am overall happy with the results versus cost
still if i could do it all again i would have spent more money for a higher quality cablei guess i dont know what to expect anymore
i mean its wire ul listed made in china so i will not let my dog near it and will work just fine
i just wish rca had not attached their name to it since it stands for radio corporation of america
have some corporate pride for gosh sakesit does the job ok but the wire material is not great
i was constantly losing a few strands during the connection project
i used banana plugs gls audio check out that review
then i needed more speaker wirethis time i decided to check out the radio shack brand
theirs is much better
their wire material is really solid
i never lost a single strand
i would still recommend this product
however the fact that i was losing a few strands all the time is quite annoying
i dont know if this affects sound quality
the sound seems to be okits nice thick wire but the quality of the wire is still just soso
i would buy agian at this price
for the price point i would give it  stars but for qulaity i give it  stars
i always argue with myself on how to rate things like this  stars for price vs  stars for quality but i think most people want to know the quality of the metals in this product so i gave it  starsnot as thick gauge as i was expecting
i would go with  gauge wire the next time to ensure that the wiring is not the cause of any lost in audio fidelity
as for regular speakers this worked out just fineits not a full  feet of speaker wire i can tell you that
after running one side i used about  ft and had only ft left
wont buy it again unless they guarantee the right amount on their spoolscompare with the mediabridge one which is  expensive than this one i can only give a three star
the mediabridge  is much heavier than this one and you can feel the difference of quality
for the metal heart inside mediabridge is much harder than this
highly recommend to buy the mediabridge one
but if you want to buy the softline type this one may be your choicefirst i can confirm that the actual product does not look like what is pictured in the official amazon photo as the wire now has a bright continuous white line on the jacket of one of the wires
the other wire includes occasion black printing rca awg speaker wire on itsecond i can confirm that the product is copper clad aluminum not copper
if you look carefully through all of the reviews you will note that the earlier iterations of the rca speaker wire used to be  oxygen free copper
not any more
apparently with copper prices skyrocketing it was no longer costeffective to provide  copper wiring
now im not one of those audio enthusiasts that insists higher end wire sounds better however it is known that aluminum wiring has almost double the electrical resistance of copper wiring recall ohms law where voltage  current  resistance so achieving consistency of your wiring is importantthird this wire is much more rigid like thick lamp wire in contrast to earlier versions of the true copper wire which was much easier to bendis this wire sonically inferior to the earlier wiring
i cannot say but for other reasons the earlier wiring was easier to work with and was just worth more
however you can get other awg lamp wire or speaker wire for much less eg
httpwwwamazoncompyramidrswgaugequalityspeakerdpbdbbjyrefsrieutfqidsr so this wire is no longer a good deal in its copper clad aluminum iterationi have a big floor and bookshelf  speakers  home theater system now it was in a smaller room and in the new room the  orignal cable was a bit short and visible so i wanted to replace the cable that it will look cleaner so i bought this i rewired the whole system and it looked greati ran out of wire exactly for the left surroundso i said i will buy another one but first i tested the sound and it was badthe center sounded extremely muffled and the detail was lacking i read that for a short distance its better to go with thicker wire my old ones are about  guage for the front mains and center and  guage for surrounds now in the center channel i heard a lot of the quiet detail and the voices sounded real and natural with the old cable  for example the fifth element when it goes from the music to when he calculates how time there is until evil arrives and he likes whispers numbers and when there is s in something somebody says and the mid woofers blend in very well with tweeter with this cable all that detail was completely goneon the fronts it made them tinny and the treble was very very low and the was a echo i ended up returning the old ones for the fronts and center and i used this only for the  surrounds at the end the surrounds sound fine my suggestion is buy this only if you have one of those home theater in a box packages with small speakersyou should replace that string thin cable because with small speakers this would make a good difference i specificly wanted to try the rca wire but i wont make that mistake againnext time im going to buy speaker cables its from a hardware store like lowes or home depotyou really cant go wrong getting this product
wouldnt recommend it for professional use but for home use its money well spentone channel went out after two months
didnt do a lot of plugging and unplugging either oh well cheap enough that i bought a sparethis sleeve is recommended by amazon for the asus eee n  netbook pc but the sleeve is not large enough
the netbook is a tight fit in the sleeve alone with the power supply cord and a netbook bluetooth mouse in the front pocket the netbook has to be forced in
i returned this sleeve and am looking for something elsei ordered this bag for a new netbook i purchased because i wanted something a little more hardy than a simple sleeve
as always targus has made a bag that looks good and is well padded providing good protection for the netbook
it also has a second section that allows you to carry your power cord andor external cd drive separate from the computer
unfortunately this bag appears to be designed so that you can use the computer while it is still in the bag
this requires you to use a strap attached inside the bag to hold the computer in place
this bag does not come with instructions as to how this strap is to be used and the only way i can see to use it is to place it over the top of the keyboardwhich obscures the center row of keys
it is possible that this is not the intent of this strap but being the clueless person i am this bag also comes with side straps so that it doesnt open flat but stays in a propped position
this is a good idea if you are using the netbook while inside the case but can be a bit of a pain if your intent is to remove the book from the case
the way these straps are attached makes it possible to adjust them but you cannot remove them
for what i wanted it for and for its price its not a bad bagim not sure if this was sincerely designed as a netbook case or whether targus just rebranded one of their portable dvd player cases
i doubt many people care to use their netbooks or any laptop for that matter without having to remove it from the case
even then the implementation in this case is absolutely incredulous
if you place your netbook just plainly in the case as shown in the picture it is  unsecured and will fall out if you tip the case in any way so much for protecting your netbook
to secure your netbook there is  a shallow mesh sleeve that encloses the netbooks wrist rests and  an adjustable horizontal velcro strap
the problem with the mesh sleeve is that using it covers your touchpad and it still doesnt  prevent the netbook from slipping out of the case
using the horizontal velcro strap will secure your netbook but then cover a row of keys on your keyboard
how is anyone supposed to use their netbook with the touchpad and keyboard obscured
minor gripes are that the hard plastic clips on the retention straps that secure the lid will scratch your netbook when the case is closed and the case doesnt stay put when you are trying to pack your netbook and the accessory pouch is already full as the weight of the lid will tilt the case away from you
again its very obvious this case was originally designed for a portable dvd player and not a netbook
also the shoulder strap is very cheap and literally a  nylon strap with no shoulder pad or grip
fortunately all is not lost
i simply cut out the mesh sleeve and retention straps and only use the velcro strap to secure the entire netbook when actually traveling
as a result the lid now opens  degrees making it much easier to packunpack all the contents independently there are no hard plastic parts to scratch my netbook and i save a few ounces of deadweight for features that never worked properly in the first place
i also tossed the worthless shoulder strap and either carry the case by the handle for short trips or slip it into my messenger bag for longer trips
i havent knocked the ratings too badly because i was able to salvage this bag but i would not buy this case again
in my opinion targus is just looking to make a quick buck by rebranding an existing dvd case that is clearly not suited for its intended purpose
if youre considering this case look at the cityline model actually designed for laptops from the start or similar cases from case logic mobile edge kroo etc that are actually designed for computers and have gotten good reviews as welli purchased this bag for my asus n net book which is great
this is a nofills bag
the n fits snugly almost too snugly
its a bit of a squeeze getting the net book into the case
i had to be careful to avoid scratching the n on the zipperas mentioned in other reviews there is very little room for accessories
im able to fit the power supply and a relatively small logitech bluetooth mouse in the front pouch
but thats about itif i had to do it again i might consider a casebag with more storage optionsi received this backpack from work to carry my laptop in and while its a nice sturdy backpack lets see how it holds up over time it simply does not have enough room for anything more than a laptop
im the kind of woman who doesnt carry a purse if she has a backpack it looks silly to me to be walking around with a backpack and a massive purseyou look like a bag lady and seriously no one needs that much space for stuff
but this barely has enough room for a  inch laptop a charger a notepad and a wallet forget about putting a sweatshirt or lunch in it
while i can make the lack of room work on some days its really the poor placement of the laptop carrier that annoys me the most
it isnt a dedicated sleeve that is usually located in a padded section in the back of the backpack
this one only has a cheaply made thin nylon zip sleeve that flops around the bag
your laptop really is not protected in this backpack so be careful about where and how hard you toss it
whenever i put the backpack on i hear this loud zipping soundits the sound of my straps loosening up
i have to tighten them at least  times a day
id say this works well for quick trips or someone who needs a simple starter backpack but i would recommend spending the extra  for a better quality backpacki bought this dvd player because i wanted one with component video and  audio outputs
the price cant be beat ive been happy with my other apex  dvd player and you can upgrade the ads firmware except for some early models to be region free  so you can play foreign dvds see nerdoutcom
it even automatically converts pal dvds to ntsc
the firmware upgrade also allows you to defeat macrovision copy protectionif these things are important to you i think youll be happy
i am
i can only give it  stars though because of some irritating though not dealbreaking flaws
they shipped the unit preset with a color setting inappropriate for the us  at least i think thats what was wrong
the result of this was that i got a black and white display when i first connected the unit to my tv
fortunately i had read i think here that you just have to change the color setting in the setup menu
it took me maybe an hour i dont even remember which settings i selected but i finally got it to work
it was frustrating as  especially when the display went wacky and i had to get back to the original settings without being able to see the onscreen menu but i managed to get it done and wow does the picture look good using component video get the special component video cables  ordinary video cables dont workanother thing that is poorly thoughtout is the location of the setup button
on the right side of the dvd drawer is the openclose button
on the left is the setup button
do you think you might get mixed up now and then and hit the wrong button
how on earth they could have decided to put a button you will probably want use only on the first day you buy the machine in a location where you will routinely mistake it for the button you want to use every time you insert a dvd is a great mystery
its one of the boneheadedest things ive ever encountered on a piece of electronic equipmentim happy with the unit though because the picture looks great the sound is great and its inexpensivewe got our bose  about  months ago
overall its pretty good
it was easy to setup and the sound quality is goodyoull like this system if you want something easy to setup you want a complete audio entertainment system with high quality not excellent sound you want to be able to play cds and dvdsyou wont like this system if you want true surround sound you want a headphone jack you want to play dvds that you create with your pc including vcds dvdrs etc  the only dvd it plays is the kind you buy you want a home stereo that has high volume you want your universal remote to work with itif bose made some very basic improvements they would have a great system including support all homemade dvd formats have the volume range higher add a headphone jack better yet have a wireless port for wireless headphones include a universal remote or make their remote compatible with universal remotesok i came to amazon hoping to just buy a replacement battery for my dscp and found that everyone here has the same problem i had
so i took someones advice below and set out to drain the battery before the infolithium computer kicked in and stopped my fun
what i found though is that resetting the battery is a lot easieri took about  pictures before the battery indicator appeared
i then realized that i was taking huge pictures and running out of memory stick space so i paused
the battery indicator kicked in and showed  minutes
as i took more pictures and connected the camera to my mac for awhile the indicator showed nominal battery drainage and seems to be back in sync
this was a battery that seemed to be unable to hold a charge for more than three or four photos with or without flashso before giving up on your battery try a quick refresh
i gave this  stars because its lame that the problem kept me from using this camera for more than a year but it was easily fixed once i knew what to dono complaints on build and product quality
its easy to assemble and wires hide behind the stand grove slots and its all goodit also make your bose speakers sound good but the problem begins when you sit at a place which is not equal distance from both speakers
you hear more from one speaker rather than equally from both of them this doesnt happen when i kept the speakers on my tv stand one at each corner of my  inch tv base there it felt like awesome sound coming from tv rather than from speakers
it felt like characters in tv are speaking when on bose stand it feels like characters are showing in tv and sound coming from speakers not very cohesive overall  i am sure there would be plenty of people out there who wont agree with me but i think i will use my bose cinemate gs ii without these standsi am in my first week using these stands and more than a month into using bose cinemate  definetly love the bose system but am thinking seriously of returning the stands will update this review with final action  decided to keep the stand
the trick is to keep the stands a bit close to the tv table also what i did is made sure that surface of the speaker front is in line with my tv  this made it much more cohesivethey look ok is about the only good thing i can say
very poor weak design
for bose owners these are a ripoff
bose was so intent that these stands only work with there one little speaker they broke every good design practice by using very small mounting screws with practically no edge distance
so if your speaker ever turns over with bose little boxes on it you can expect a broker unrepairable stand
being a design engineer i was able to foil there efforts by carefully oversizing the holes to take a normal screw and adding a second screw into my speaker case at the bottom
it looks great with my gigaworks thx speakers and is much stronger than what bose intended
bose only provided the one undersized screw and a tiny plastic nub at the bottom which is supposed to barely hole the speaker straight
my speakers are now mounted much stronger than boses weak engineering and look a sound a lot better
i will be adding pictures of theseimportant note these speaker stands are advertised as universal when in fact they are not
they are designed to only work with one bose speaker the small cube
i would have rated as one star but since i was able to mount my speaker even better than they intended i will give them  stars for their failed effort a bad engineeringthe stands are really well built
they are solid and heavy able to hold a good sized speaker
they are not universal though
my yamaha speakers did not fit
i had to use different screws and add some nuts to make them fit rightit fits perfectly on my bose speakers as promised although its a tad short as compared to the pictures
and it wiggles slightly when on top of the carpet as compared to standing on hardwood floorsdespite the attractive pricing this machine is certainly no bargain
i thought it might serve as an upstairs complement to the panasonic dvd rvk i have downstairs
but especially in the light of recent price drops on the latter machine its difficult to rationalize purchase of the apex even if its currently in the same price range as inexpensive vcrs
the tray doesnt slide open it opens with a loud scrape and thunk
the minimal onsite controls  practically force you to rely on the remote which features the largest number of tiny buttons ive ever seen crammed onto a tiny surface area
unless you have laser eyes and muchkin fingers its unlikely youll be able to punch one button without hitting several others
if you factor in the cost of returning the unit along with the postage you might have saved on another machine youll probably realize as i have that in this case less is simply lessi thought that i made a good deal when buying this from the seller
although i knew it was used it still gave me problems shortly after the purchase
it tended to skip repeatedly when playing various dvds
i really liked the apex dvd players i was very disappointed in this product purchasebe sure and listen to this speaker before you buy it
quotconsumer reportsquot rates it last of  tested center channel speakers with an accuracy of quotquot out of quotquot
their comment is quotfair
there are better choicesquot
 issuei do not own this speaker but bought its predecessor the vs based on the bose reputation
regretfully i had to replace it with another brand even though the rest of my theatre system is all bose
i even have bose s throughout my home
their other speakers are excellent
bose just does not seem to achieve the realism in their center channel speakers that they are so famous for in their other equipmentfirst of all bose took a month to ship it even though it was said to be in stock
they are the maker
there is no excuse for this
if id have known that i wouldnt have bought itthe thing is really inefficient
i have it set db higher then the cerwinvega it replaced
while this is ok with a really powerful receiver most will clip on that channel with the volume up when the others are running at higher volumes
not very good
you could buy a huge amp to run this or probably a better move would be to pass it up and look for something with at least a   inch driverthe size is small and that is nice for me
it is for my garage system and it sits on my workbench under the tv
space is at a premium so this gets high marks for thatthe sound is very nice
it does a very nice job on voices
i like the sound a lotoverall it works for me
the sound is nice
it puts a considerable limit on your system volume because when it is running at a proper volume that channel is going to clip when to others are just cruising
i dont play my system too loudly so it works well for me
bose is way too slow to ship
i got it from them because it was  and much less than anywhere else
if id have known it would have been a month to ship i wouldnt have gotten itone problem with surge protectors is they are like fuses  if you test it for its total protection it self destructs
so the only way to know it will work is to examine the construction test nondestructive parts and then hope the rest work as advertised
i disassemble units and examine them before i even plug them inprosergonomics of the plug layout is very convenientaudible alarmprotection ratingconson disassembly the unit had a lot of excess flux it was so thick in some parts its like vaseline
there were a few strands of hair inside
its banks of protection diodes were soldered with unacceptably long leads  of them were shorted
it didnt affect the protection since the polarity was correct but it shorted two data lines together sure enough the network jack did not work until i separated these diode leadsthe mov grouped together were coupled to their thermal fuses with a form of tape
unfortunately one of them had unraveled so they were not coupled at all this means had a surge happened the fuses were less likely to blow or would be delayed
most makers use shrink wrap tubing to hold them together
better designs encase the mov in a small chambers inside the chassis to further contain debris and focus the heat on the fuse but not this unitafter cleaning the interiors there were no problem with the sockets power led annunciators phone fast ethernet and cableim not sure what the story was with this unit but i returned it
if it was a fluke from poor quality control then on my examination of the other components this spd could work
however they mov coupling is not optimal the unit will get fairly hot before the fuse blows and likely melt the chassis before tripping the fuse
sure enough some user posted an image of a unit with a melted deformed chassis
maybe tripp lite has improved this design since i bought mine so given a benefit of doubt i rate it  starsthese are ok earbuds
they are a little slick so if you start to sweat they will want to slide out of your earsi had a very difficult time keeping the earbuds in my ears
my ear openings arent that small
id say theyre average in size and these earbuds kept falling out
could be because theyre flat rather than being cone shaped or having different sizes to fit the different size ears
i just found them difficult to use
the best thing i liked about them is the inline volume controlthe sound is as good as any pair of headphones but they keep falling out
im not sure if its becasue being a female my ear holes are small but they just wont stay put comfortablythe sound quality is great
i have had no problems with that or product quality
these have lasted me a long time
i also love the inline volume control
i hate having to take out my ipod every time i want to make a change and this allows me to put on my music lock my ipod and use the earbuds exclusively
the carrying case is nice and keeps the earbuds protected
however the badthese are not very comfortable
right when i put them in theyre okay but not the best
then after long use they start hurting my  ears
i cant pinpoint the problem but i think theyre just a little too big
if youre looking for something comfortable id head in a different direction
but these do the job for me because i have a pair of over ear headphones that i use when im on a long trip or have longterm use ahead of me
these earbuds are good while im mowing the grass or doing another short taski wish they came with a mic to answer calls because the sound is great
i guess ill only use them for my ipod vs my iphonethe sound is good bassy but the trouble we had was with the cordwiring
it didnt retract easily which is why we bought these for our teenagers
so they wouldnt have dangling cords when they are running or working out
they didnt last long and were eventually replaced with something elsethey sound okay too i suppose
theyre rather flimsy though and it doesnt seem like much thought nor effort went into the quality and design of these which surprised me since theyre sony branded
i wont buy these again
shipping and delivery was what would normally be expected of amazon  prompti bought these because they were cheap and they are singlepull  the wire is on only one side
they lived up to those two requirements
the cord is a little too short
and its not that loud even at the full volume
i think the volume control hurts the signal even when its turned all the way up
given all that theyre cheap and do the jobi thought these would be lightweight
i like the item but prefer headphones to have a light band around the head
i was not that happy with it
i compared it to my old set and saw a noticable differencei bought this based on others reviews its features list and the reviews on several sites
i also had a nearly expired gift certificate balance to use up
if id paid cash for it i may have returned it
that being said for under  its a serviceable tripod
the legs at full extension feel very flimsy and in even mild wind generate shake
theres no hook though some sites descriptions claimed there was one to add weight to counteract this but one could easily be devised
the fluid pan head is anything but at least in the vertical theres spots where it grabs andor sticks
horizontal panning is acceptable
the bubble level not mentioned in the amazon features list is hard to view and use
the quick release head offers no knurling for finger tightening and is recessed in the shoe requiring a screwdriver or coin to tighten though it does attach securely to the camera and tripod
overall im disappointed in the quality but for what i ended up paying for it i cant complain too loudlyfor the price this tripod is ok
it is a bit unstable when fully extended
could have gotten it on ebay for half the pricewhen i got this cable it felt a little cheaper than high quality cable
it also measured slightly less than the standard rg diameter creating some problems for loose fit of my ends
the other issue was the coil was so tight and stiff that it made this cable difficult to unroll and distribute without kinks or tangling
the cable seems to perform well and when stripped it has good copper insulation and wire wrap
i am looking for a better supplierits a good unit
sensitive to pressure meaning while playing if you hold it too tight it will throw off the sound
not sure if it will last over time
i needed it for a quick job and now it sits on my shelf till the next time
this unit is inexpensive and you get what you pay for i knew that at the time of purchaseit served me wellsoso for mei would have given it  stars if i use it only for voice note
it does what it is supposed to and it does it wellhowever it didnt work well for my daughters violin lesson
the idea was she records herself andor her teacher and later she plays along with the recorded thing for practicethe problem is the recorded notes sound always a bit higher than originally played on the instrument
i guess the tape speed is faster when playing back than when recording for some reason
maybe you wouldnt notice at first but as soon as you try to play along with the tape it becomes apparentprobably i was hoping too much for an inexpensive microcasette recorder though
i wouldnt blame the manufacturerextremely compact and easy to use but may need something to stand on
this tripod is amazingly small but probably wont work for every occasion
it is too short to stand by itself to be a real tripod but if you can find an extra stand such as a table or a tree post then it works really goodfirst of all this tripod has the feel and look of a cheaply made imported item  thats why i give it  stars
i realize you get what you pay for  but hey its still cheap productthe legs do not extend  but they seem sturdy and firmly stay in place when unfolded
there is one tightening screw that controls the amount of pivoting and adjustment you can make
the tripod takes up a relatively small amount of space when folded up  roughly   at is widest point by  warning
dont be foolish and attach anything bigger than a compact camera or a camera that was designed for travel i experimented
the reason is the tripods footprint is too small  if you put a camera w a detachable lens or a camcorder atop this pipsqueak the center of gravity will be too high and it will tip over easily  there goes your big  investment all because of a  tripodive bought this several times and what can i say
it works so you really cant complain because it doesnt cost alot for this and i would recommend having a backup or two in case the adhesive gives out
this also depends on the size of the lens cap youre placing it on so within reason mm or less works great
i had them stick on for quite sometime and if it does gets loose use a small strip of gaffer or electric tape
sticks right back on
i did however tested it on larger filter sizes such as mm and i could say that they wont stick on very long
it stuck on for at least several months and gave outi dont have this product
the solution i came up with is to put velcro i used industrial strength on the exterior side of the lens cap and on the bottom of the camera use the soft velcro on whichever of those will be touching something in your camera bag that the hard velcro will stick to
i havent used the camera much since but it seems good so farmy nikon d lens cap doesnt really have an area big enough for the sticky tab to fit on this and still look professional looks like a giant sticker covering my nikon logo so thats why the  stars other than that seems to do fine for now
id prefer to be able to stash the lens cap somewhere thats more out of the way other than dangling from the camera personally so im still looking for a better solutionthe string is very short and i dont think the connector will last long
it also makes the cap hit the lens quite a lot due to its shortnessthe band is a little too thick on this cap saver
i have bought others in the past and the bnad was thin enough to wrap around the end of the lense in the groove on the end
this strap is much thicker and you cant do that
i had to wrap the strap around the grip of the lense
it works but not what i was used to usingsony cut corners probably saved a nickel by hardwiring a very short  inch long phono cable to the back of the unit
since turntables cannot normally be stacked on top of other audio equipment eg
amplifierreceiver they end up on the side or on another shelf too far away for the included  inch long cable
youll need to either find some rca phone jack to phono jack female to female connector adapters or a female rca jack to male rca phono plug cable
you can order through amazon but you may not find these connectors or cables in local hifi outlets
i give this unit only  stars because of this frustrating irritation  got already to set it up to replace an old turntable and discovered i was  inches too short to plug into my receiveramps phono input
since nearly all adapter cables are  to  feet in length i am not sure what sony was thinking with the very short  or so hardwired cable on the back of the unit except a lame attempt to save a nickel in manufacturingthese will work as advertised as long as you figure out how to position them perfectly and dont need your remote to operate more than a few feet from them
i have one of them facing my cable box from about  feet away then in the next room i have one on my office desk
however unless my cable remote is less than about  feet from the one on my desk and pointed fairly accurately at the receiver it wont recognize the signal
so just be close to it with your remote and itll work finethis turntable is ok for the casual lp listener
i had to hook it up to an old amp i had to get any sound out of it and even with that there is an annoying hum
i have about  lps and i needed a new turntable
my old one was just like this and after about  years it started to play records too fast or too slowi would recommend checking out thinkgeeks selection as they have portable players plus vinyl to mp converters that are a better deal than this onewhite discs not the usual silver which i prefer
other than that okay
i just would have preferred silver
i wish the description had specified this facti have a love dislike relationship with belkin products
i as an it tech with experience back to the early days found their products to be either good or boat anchors
over the years they have got better with the technical details of some of their product linethis cable works as designedit is a recommendi liked this mouse alot
it was very confortable and easy to use but it stopped working after less than a yearamazon three star rating  its okay  works well enough
logitech sw andor drivers not required for our functionuse with windows
receives just three stars due to included documentation directing user to unnecessary logitech sw which wasted  minutes of my time
it is large so while it fits my hand the wife and kids hate it
track ball is useful for limited desk space
no problems shipping or packagingthis item is great for casual scrolling forget it if you are a designer or gamersome context
i spent the last  years using thinkpads with the pointing stick in they keyboard
i seriously considered not buying anything but a thinkpad there are other reasons but i wanted a portable gaming rig and landed on a dell mx
i hated the touchpad so i needed a pointing devicethe mouse is very comfortable and sold feeling
i have largeish hands and i can get to the main keys and the ball easily enough
the have only found two issues
the ball can get a bit sticky on my fingers which manifests itself in pointer movement when i take my finger off the ball
its not normally a problem except when i am doing detailed graphics work
the other issue is that the left mini button is easy to get to and functions as a back button which is really handy
the right mini button serves as a middle button but since it is located at the top of the right side i have a very very hard time to reaching it with my index ring or pinking finger
it is almost unusable
there also seems to be a driver requirement that simulates the third mouse buttonit doesnt work in games or in vmwarei am happy with the mouse but not that excited
frankly i dont think i would be happy with any mouse other than a pointy stickthis cassette deck does have some really good features like hx pro dolby b amp c music search ams which looks for blank spaces to guess where the next song is and full dubbing capabilities
i have it connected to my onkyo av receiver via both output and input since all of my components operate through the receiver
it works well this way and i can record from all sources with no problemi have a problem with the sound
its not as good as the specs would have you believe
ive compared it with an onkyo tape recorder and although the numbers are similar as far as wow amp flutter and dynamic range the onkyo is much better it was too expensive and had less features but now i see why it cost more
the big thing is the lack of a remote
sony has this funky aii communication bus system which is only truly useful if you buy all sony components
i dont so its useless to me
the excuse for not including the remote is that you can buy a sony cd changer that can control this tape deck
i dont like it when companies use this method to obtain sales so chances are ill eventually resell this deck and get one with its own remote and better soundi paid   tax at circuit city
same price as from jampramazon and with shipping costs the price is almost equal
id say buy it if the price is  or less
thats all its worth to me personallyi dont think it really makes a lot of sense to buy some really expensive piece of equipment to play  year old tapes
they are going to sound pretty bad regardless
so this deck does the trick
it is inexpensive and seems to be a sturdy reliable deck
as others have stated though the omission of a remote control is kind of shocking and unforgiveable in this day and agefirst modem was dead out of the box
on its way back to amazon now with a replacement on the way to me
couldnt get it to synch with cox cable in northern va i worked with cox supporttried cycling power reprovisioning unplugging for hoursnothing
when the installer guy hooked up his toshiba modem it synched immediately
after two days of trying to synch my linksys i decided it was deadalsowish linksys would relabel the lights
seems a bit confusing the way it is see earlier reviews
my cable light never stayed lit like you would assume it shouldbut regardlessi couldnt get an ip address from their dhcp server
i have confidance in linksys products so i still give this modem  stars
im sure the next one will work fine crossing fingerscheck with your isp mines comcast before purchasing
their website should have a list of compatible modems
this one is not compatible with cocast colorado
i found out the hard wayunfortunately the unit that i received kept dropping its ip address frequently about once every ten minutes
i verified that the problems originated with the cable modem rather than my computer or router
it also turned out to be hardware version  but was listed on a page for hardware version  devices different docsis specs
i returned the defective modem for a refund
it was labeled as very good condition but had been obviously tampered with before
theoretically based on the specs this is a very stable solid cable modem for docsic  and   having owned various linksys network gear i would think that a functional unit would be a stable reliable cable modem
make sure to get the hardware version listed as approved modems with your cable provider
mine for example requires a rev devicei am a big fan of linksys products
theyve always been very affordable and get the job done
however i would have to say this is my least favorite linksys product
i bought it figuring it would look good on the stack with my linksys router switch and wireless apoverall it works relatively well
however in certain situations i ran into issues
if you run connection intensive applications that open many connections the modem does have a tendency to lock up
cycling power seems to correct this
ive seen other people post similar issues with connection dropping in certain situations
i am a software developer and often run applications that will open many simultaneous connections so this was an issue for me
i have since switch modems and no longer have this issueoverall it works well just requires the occasional shutdownstartup to clear it outi got this mouse a year and a month ago
it has started working erratically when it was about a year old
when i tried to close one tab on my browser it would close the whole browser
it would jump around and just act bad
ive replaced it but i still miss it
or i miss what it was like when new
but i think a mouse should last more than  months
even the old friction ball mice would last longer especially one that cost 
theres no way to take it apart clean it out and fix it
it was just a waste of moneyi loved this mouse at first
its a big improvement over my old mouse that had a ball
recently the side buttons started to lose their programming
i didnt even change it i kept the default settings
sometimes i find myself opening my mouse software every few minutes to click the ok button just to make the side buttons work
i wish i had bought the cheaper one but i dont feel like going through the hassle of returning this mouse and hooking up another oneim adding to this
i gave away that mouse  two years ago when i bought a new computer
an optical mouse came with the computer
i do not miss the extra buttonsthis mouse is very light and the side buttons are very easy to touch by mistake
the buttons are much too sensitive and i had to disable the right one due to constantly touching it by mistake
i finally returned it and found a heavier mouse with side buttons higher up and also cordlessi really would like to have kept this mouse because it fits my hand so well
but since i do alot of photoshop i was annoyed by the fact that the mouse goes to sleep and i have to wake it up
i also agree with the other reviews that you couldnt get the mouse to behave the same way as a wired mouse would for precision but since this is my first wireless i have had no other expif you are looking for a mouse that is comfortable this is a good candidate
its nice when i do system admin or program but once i start designing then i cannot live without an optical mouse and i got this one at work expecting it to be perfect
it isnt perfect
the tracking on it is great  it never sticks like the roller type and it moves smoothly without any jittermy two main gripes are   it is too light
it is so light that it feels cheap
  i dont have large hands but just setting my hand on top of the mouse causes the right click button to click
this is very annoying when trying to browse the net or work  as it usually causes some type of popup menu to appear
id prefer it to be heavier and to make the buttons especially the right click button much smaller and a little harder to clickit worked really well and i was totally satisfied with this mouse until several months ago
which means after two years of usagethe problem slowly came up to the surfacesingle click was started to be recognized as a double clickim kind of getting sense on how much pressure on the left mouse button determines single click or double clickif i press the button very lightly it register as single clickif i press little bit harder it takes it as double clickin scroll button case they are revertedpress scroll button hard makes single click and lighter makes double clicknow im sick of it since numerous times a day i launch wrong application because of that double click problem and considering buying logitech mxms could have done better with this mouse
overall it performs well but it doesnt feel as solidly built as the mechanical wheel mouse it replaces
the optical mouse is light very light
a kink in the cord will push the mouse back when you lift your hand
a small metal slug within the mouse body would have given it more heft and better feel in my opinion
the buttons have the same feel as the mechanical version but the wheel is a bit looser in comparisonthis mouse has a ps style connector and ms also supplies an adapter to use with a free usb port if youre so inclined
fit and finish are up to the usual ms mouse standards and it has a generous cord lengtha bit more heft and a better scroll wheel would move this mouse from a star to a star performergreat device to getthe product does exactly what it is designed to actually do and it does so reliably
but the real question is does what the product actually do stand up to its marketing as a way to stop telemarketers from calling youthe answer is to some degree sortofthe way it works is this the telemarketer calls you
you or your answering machine answers the call and the telezapper beeps
if the telemarketer is using the right equipment to recognize that tone as being a nonworking number the telemarketer will automatically disconnect from the call and theoretically delete your phone number from the list it is usingso lets look at this closer
your phone still rings
if you or your answering machine does not answer the ringing phone the beeptone is never heard by the telemarketers equipment
the result of not answering the phone is the same with or without the telezapperokay so we have to answer the phone once
but after that one time arent we deleted from the lists they all use
well no
there are lots of lists out there
some are used only once
doesnt do much good to be removed from a list that will never be used again
but in all fairness you will be removed from a few lists that might have gotten used againmy personal experience was that initially there was no change in the number of calls
it took some time before any of those beeps my telezapper made had any effect on whether or not i was going to get called again
during this first period i still got to talk to a lot of telemarketers because they werent using equipment that the telezapper had any effect uponafter about three or four months i realized that there were far fewer times that i answered the phone and no one was there
that could mean one of two things either the telezapper was working and i was really was being taken off the lists or telemarketers stopped using the kind of equipment thats stopped by the telezapperits been over two years now and at one point there was a big change in the number of calls coming in
for a few weeks i was suddenly again getting lots of calls with no one there
my speculation is that the telezapper worked and i was taken off of quite a few lists but at that point all new lists were put into use and those lists once again included my nameyou cant really control who calls you on the phone any more than you can control which people you pass on the street will say something to you
but just as there are things that you can do to discourage people you pass from saying something to you there are things you can do to discourage telemarketers from calling you
the telezapper can be a part of your arsenal but dont expect it to be the best tool you can use
and since the telezapper doesnt start to do anything unless you or your answering machine picks up the phone dont expect this tool to take the lead eitherso the telezapper functions
it does have some effect
is it worth the price
well i dont have any regrets about spending the money but i wouldnt do it againunfortunately as i rewrite this review the federal do not call list is being challenged by the telemarketers
some states do not call lists were disassembled because of the coming of the federal list
but despite the problems i still would suggest signingup for the federal do not call list and if your state still is accepting new signups get on their list toostill i believe the best tool is to simply say please put me on your do not call list and hangup
on the other hand if youre not as assertive as i can be with telemarketers the telezapper saves you from having to speak directly to sone telemarketers so the price may be worth it to you
just remember that the phone will still ring and you or an answering machine will still have to pickup before the telezapper does anythingalso checkout the newer version of the telezapper
it is smaller and is also capable of generating not just the simple beep that this one can but the threetones that you often hear if you call a number thats not working
the problem with the three tones is that people you want to talk to assume there is something wrong with your phone and hangup
both the old and the new telezapper essentially work the same so i would suggest choosing by pricethe seller savewithsteve is great got everything on time and as desribed
this feedback is nothing to do with the seller or his servicei think there is a inherent flaw in this product
although it depends on what you use it for i would recommend going for dayton bactgrb banana plug pair compression type
if you are thinking of using these in the wall plates which have pin type inlets let me warn you  they are thicker and cannot be used
if i have to just use them in speaker and av receiver trust me banana types are much better choicethey are just lying with me now opened and unused
maybe i will use them one dayi had these connectors in the past just bought a new recevier and needed some new ones i went ahead and started searching for good banana plugs i found cheaper ones that sound just as good as these onesoverall the monsters ones are easy to install and are good quality but you can find cheaper ones of the same qualitygls audio black chrome series generation  gold connector banana plugs banana clips   pack  reds   blacksvery easy to use but overpriced however there is not much else out there with similar design
radio shack carries similar banana plugs but they cost only a couple of dollars lessobviously sound quality wise these are not any better than  banana plugs where you have to tighten the screws the question to ask is whether the convenience is worth  to youthree stars only because they are overpriced if they were  i would have given them  starsthese connectors are okaythere doesnt seem to be anything about them that warrants their high pricethey are goodbut not greatthere are many lower priced connectors that are just as goodor betterthese cases are just okay
i have a lot of maxell double cd cases but ive had trouble finding them so i bought these
they dont grip the cds quite strong enough so the cds sometimes fall off and the centerpiece tends to snag the paper label on the back of the case
if youre just storing cds these will work fine but if you want to access your cds regularly they arent that greatthese are little cheap but fine
two came broken in the package but they do the job
i will look around for something better next time i need to order themalthough i enjoyed my sony clie nc for four days and agree with many of the good points that others here have mentioned i must add my two cents of caution
it is a smart looking piece the mp player works nicely very sweet sound and for the most part well designed but the jog dial is too far down on the side making it difficult to use and the back button is below it making it impossible to use your thumb to click it unless you are doublejointed the screen is beautiful in the bright daylight have never seen anything like it
however it is against a grey silver reflective background
note all the product picture have a simulated and unrealistic screen shot
the front light is fair to poor
my old palm iiic is about  times brighter so if you really want the resolution i guess its a fair tradeoff
by the way the screen is about  smaller the palm os and clie bundled multimedia software works at high resolution few other apps take advantage of it
if you need reading glasses to read the thin and elegant font will challenge youi am reluctantly returning mine because the protective flip cover keeps popping off
i called sony and they could not replace this simple part
after being on hold for  minutes and another  to resolve the issue
they could not exchange nor send me a new flip cover
i was so disappointed that i figured if anything major should happen i would be in deep trouble
they did offer to give me a full refund though i will pay for shipping it backif you must have hires and a mp player orand if you have good vision dont mind a not bright screen and dont care about customer support then this is the machine for youi just wanted to confirm steven g neubecks review
i am on my second set of s after having returned the first set under warranty
i am now told by altec that the  is discontinued so if i turned my second set i would receive a lesser quality set of speakers
if memory serves i believe they said i would receive sheres the beef
the speakers are great but in my case the subwoofer on both sets has died after about  months use
since i do not plan to return my second set i decided to see if i could fix the sub and discovered the source of the problemfirst i noticed that if i left the speakers unplugged for an extended period of time  not just turned off but unplugged  the subwoofer would start to work again after i turned it back on
a light bulb lit up somewhere over my head and i suspected there was a heat issue
after plugging it back in it would work for a while then quickly begin to stutter until finally it stopped producing bass againthe satellites have never been a problemso i took the sub apart
disclaimer i do not recommend this to anyone as there is nothing inside that can be removed as the box is actually very well made with everything sealed in place with very strong heatglue
to remove any of the internal components would involve melting the glue which is quite impractical
it will not unstick just by prying either as that will simply break the plastic part that the glue is holding
trust meafter failing to extricate anything from the sub i peered inside with my flashlight to see what i could see
there are two visible circuit boards one on top of the other and one heatsink mounted perpindicular to the top board
at the far end of the bottom board i noticed some molex style plugs
they were very inaccessble being at the very center of the sub behind the speaker inputs and various other circuitry
but i could plainly see that the plugs were melted
so i did what any experienced computer builder would do and left the rear panel off
apparently the sub was not getting enough cooling and as long as it stays cool it works melted plugs and all
i now have it plugged into a switched outlet so i can completely disconnect the power after i am done using itwarning should you attempt the same remedy be concious of the power connector leads on the inside bottom of the rear panel
they are exposed potentially creating an electrocutionfire hazardi bought this card as a spare memory for my casio mp digicamthe original memory that i got free as a bonus with the camera wasbranded edge and also has mb on it
the first thing i did wheni got the viking card was of course insert in into the camera and seeif it works
it sure did but i immediately noticed that it is quitea bit slower than edge
maximum resolution pictures produce filesabout mb in size and it took good  seconds to record them tothis viking card
add to that  seconds that camera takes for imageprocessing and you get whopping  seconds from shot to shotfor comparison with the edge card it is  seconds
still a lot but notas frustratingthe only plus  viking is cheap from many retailers and rebates are oftenavalablemy advice if you need sd memory for digital photography at high resolutionget a card with guaranteed high transfer rate  at least mbsecyoull have to pay more but it is worth itperforms as advertised  but this is a commodity item so buy this product by pricebrettno drivers to be found to get this old sound card to work on a windows  operating system
they did a good job of getting rid of those drivers or keeping it out of reach
the drivers on the cd that it came with work on windows  and windows vista any operating system above that youre out of luck
i love the audio chips that came in these sound cards and the drivers that helped to make it work 
creative labs sound blaster i know these cards are old but i sure wish you would keep its drivers updated on your web page to get it to work on all up and coming operating systemsso i got this card from a dell there doesnt seem to be much support from creative for the drivers for windows sound hardware hasnt changed by magnitudes like chipsets or video cards yet creative cant make available or write some simple drivers for windows search the net for sb and dell  and youll find my drivers for windows  xnot really needed and cord is not long enough to reach rear of car unless you buy an extention  units internal antenna seems to do fine on its owneven under steel roofswhat is remarkable is how small this case is for such a big price
if you want a case to hold your  beanbag mount remote control and cigar lighrer adapterspeakerthis is not it
simply too smallinstead go find yourself a nice camcorder case
i found a  one at a meijer stare on closeout for  and it amply holds all these things
something garmins  case cannot hope to dodumb product unless you just want to protect the base unit and nothing elsethe gps fits well into this case but it lacks protective padding
it most likely would not protect your gps if you were to drop it
there are many after market cases that would do a much better job of protecting your investmenti bought the carrying case to use with the garmin street pilot deluxe package
with the case you can snugly fit the garmin street pilot unit alone
however when trying to also put it the cigarette adapterspeaker both dont fit without having the zipper on top partially opened
also dont even consider trying to store the bean bag mount in the casei do like the fact that the bottom of the case has a protective cushion so the unit can be stored face downi think it would be nice if they had another sized bag  one which can store the unit adapter cable plus the bean bag mount all together
this would be the ideal size for those who want to carry the unit and all the accessories at oncereview update the original review is for trying to hold the street pilot iii with accessories
the case does fit the newer smaller garmin units
i was able to easily fit the garmin street pilot  with its cigarette lighter adapter and remote control
i also was able to add the external power adapter too  but this was a bit tighter fit when the adapter was added ini purchased this camera on sale with rebates and paid much less than retail
the camera operates fine for me but the quality of the picture is not very good
if you have bright lighting it works fine although it is tough to get it to look focused unless what you are capturing is very close to the camera
the software that comes with it allows you to take snapshots and video clips
it provides software to broadcast your webcame to the world but you will need to eventually pay for a spotlife account and this is the only option given by the software
if you are buying this to just let the kids mess around and make little video clips or just for instant messenger duty it will work fine
just dont purchase for the retail price
fiy  i have mine hooked to a hp n piii  ghz  mb win xp home laptop
for the price i paid im satisfied with the results of this average beginner webcamwas a little difficult to put together  holes for inserting the metal into the wood base are not necessarily in the exact right place  it needed a little tweaking but i finally got it right
it really is pretty decent looking once assembled and it hold a lot of cdsthis is the third of these i have purchased because i like the design and the price but these are made in china with subamerican standard tolerances on machines and poor factory quality control
there are three large pieces apparently made on different lines and they just misfitting togetheri give  stars for design four stars for stability and functionality but zero stars for construction qualitytwo pieces are the wired tops
inserting the bottom wired piece into the base finds it going into the holes in the base but not in near the centers of the holes
the plastic fasteners need the inserted wires to be in the center to screw on properly and without stripping
the tool they provide makes it easy to strip the threads in the soft plastic but it can be done with patience and firm but not excessive force
put the force on centering the wire not on the plastic fastener or the threads will be stripped
two people can do this better than onethat done then the job is to put the two wired assemblies together
again they require a good bit of adjusting difficult because there are four wires to be placed into the receivers and you cannot put one down to far or the others are at too great an angle
again it requires patience firmness and four hands are better than twothe little decorative balls on the top are worthless
in my three units  balls only two have had properly sized holes in the wooden balls
one was way too large and just wobbled on the top with no friction at all on the sides
the other  including all four of these were way too small
for the first unit i bought i went to a woodworker friends and borrowed his vice and drill bits and made the holes big enoughnow all of the balls have been tossed without loss of aestheticsthis is a very nice design and it is a pity that the manufacturing tolerances are so substandardi bought this for my camera but have found that it is much better to buy individual rechargeable batteries such as energizer and use those with the camera
the kodak batteries have a short life and eventually hold very little charge
further i would recommend buying as small a case as possible for your camera
it makes it much easier to carry the camera around and thus you are much more likely to take pictures
ive taken over  with my kodak easyshare cx and i hope you get to take just as many yourself
happy snappingyes the cord is short
but i got around that by using this laptop mouse with my laptop which i thought was creative of me
and my mouse hasnt broken either
nothing specialjust a slightlysmallerthanmostmouses portable mouse
certainly a better choice than the twiceasexpensive kensington pocket mouse pro with the niftysounding retractable cable which like other kensington products broke on me hours out of the box
so belkin
good enoughokay  even the original battery doesnt last very long
while they charge fairly quick id rather they took longer to charge and worked longer
even with a spare youre not going to last all day taking lots of shots with even two batterieswhile it is not the batteries fault it is still a problem i think they wont solve soon
had i known beforehand that the canons ate so much battery life so quickly i would have purchased a different camera
i cant fill my  mb stick with the use of a single batteryso if you like to travel and go on hikes etc
where weight is important i would highly recommend finding a camera that doesnt eat batteries like they were candy
the camera is light enough but the batteries are inefficient and you need to take a fully charged army of them with you on a back country trip adding a lot of unneeded weightthe canon nbl is an ok battery however you can do much better by purchasing an aftermarket product
specifically sterlingtek makes a replacement with a rating of mah which is almost double that of the canons
the price on the sterlingtek is only  shipping is  but is free for orders over 
the price difference is more than just a few bucks as another review claimed
their web site is i use the nbl from canon with my s and i also hve some aftermarket batteries
i am surprised that the canon isnt lasting a lot longer then the aftemarket batteries
dont get me wrong it works ok but not sure it is worth spending a lot more to get the canonthe canon nbl battery pack is just ok but it serves my needsit is recommend that you buy a spare battery or even two spare batteriespositives the nbl charges very fast
it charges fully in a little over an hour
 you can take a decent number of pictures without having to recharge the battery
i took about  at the x resolution in the fine mode on my canon s in about  hours of shooting time and that was with the display on
if you turn the display off this time will be extended significantlynegatives the charge does not last very long usually less than a day
this is why that spare battery is mandatory
 the nbl battery is very limiting
it can only be used with canon s s s and s digital cameras  elura mc camcorders
i could understand if it could be used with the whole line of canon digital cameras but no it can only be used with those models
the other canon cameras have there own batteries such as the nbl
i dont know why this is
maybe its a money thing with canon
 its expensive
though the price has gone down significantly from when it was first introduced a few years ago its still costly
since you must buy a spare battery its hard on the wallet to buy one of these let alone twooverall if you have any of the above model cameras you will need this battery even with all its flaws
the fact that this battery takes little or no time to charge is indeed the upside
so even if you cant afford a spare battery you will not have to wait forever to get it back up and running to take some more picturesthe clie t would have rated  stars if not for its extremely dim screeni bought the t and used it for  weeks before returning it and buying a clie c
i highly recommend the c
while i absolutely loved the ts thin brushed aluminum chassis i just couldnt get used to how dim the screen is
if there is any kind of bright light behind you the screen is almost impossible to read
you need to have the back light on almost all the time and even that was unsatisfactory
the bluegreen back light is too weak to remedy the situationanother disappointment is the quotscreen commanderquot sonys program that turns the clie into a remote control unit for your tv and some other components
not that i bought the clie for this feature but it would have been cool if it had worked well
the problem is that the t will only control  components at a time  your tv dvd vcr and receiver
it will not control your cable box or a cd changer so for me the feature turned out to be worthlessbottom line though is that the screen is just too dim
if sony fixes the screen brightness they will have a real winner on their hands because the t has by far the coolest form factor of any pdathis is my first wireless mouse and ive used it for  hoursweek for over a month
it works ok  the pointer is at times a little jumpy and at other times not very responsive
however for me in my situation its worth dealing with that in order to be wire free
i have used it for more than a month without having to change the batteriesive given this portable eq a split rating of three stars for a couple of reasons which ill briefly explainim a professional sound recordist
so i do know sound gear
i didnt buy this to use professionally but to help improve the listenability of audio teaching tapes that im having to listen to with online classes
some of these recordings were done thirty years ago and are terrible as far as the audio quality is concerned
a couple you can hardly understand what is being saidso i bought this little inline eq just to help with trying to make these old teaching sessions easier to listen to
for that purpose the koss eq works just fineit is a three band eq so that makes it limited in how much boost youll get and where it will give it
the three faders are labeled bass mid and treble and thats pretty much where they areyou plug your device into the input and your buds or headphones into the output
pretty simple
and it works pretty good for an inexpensive booster
now for the rest of the storythe way these devices work is that not only does it have a master volume control but three individual volume controls
thats what the faders are volume boosts or cuts at specific frequencies
so this little unit has a total of four volume controls
the noise that others have complained about is real and much of it is post master fader in what can be called the final section
there is a direct correlation between the amount of power a device uses and the signaltonoise ratio
in laymens terms the more power a device can get the quieter it is
if a device is built to use the minimum amount of power its likely to be noisy
its more complicated than that but suffice it to say this little eqs chip doesnt use much juice at all so it can get noisythe only thing you can do is try to pump as much volume into the device as you can before you overload the input
that way youll induce less noise through the faders
but since the main noisiness is post master volume theres not a lot you can do about it overallso my recommendation is this if you need a booster for something like listening to transcriptions or old muddy sounding radio shows or old teaching tapes this unit may work fine for you
if you are wanting something to boost your walkman or ipod volume and still want to hear music the way its supposed to sound you should probably look to other devicesi have not used this much just to see if problems r my wi fi or enternet it works good for thatit is a coupler for rj  connections and it does the job but that is about it
i would have expected a little more substance to the product but it is flimsy
it does work so  stars is all it getsthis is a great pda
elegant design fast practical the best among all models before tungsten
the best value for your money as well
i used to have a palm viix another great pda but i decided to switch to this model mostly because of the supposedly better wireless capabilities internet access even google
 aol instant messenger email etc the amazing documents to go program and also for the fabulous expansion card with the merriamwebster dictionary
i have only two major complaints the wireless service is too expensive and the multimail  email program takes longer than with the palm viix let alone it gobbles very quickly your monthly allotment of k
in less than a month just using email it has already used up k
and to think that with my palm viix i barely used k each month if the wireless service were less expensive and more efficient there is a number of error messages each time this palm would be hands down the best of all
i will continue to enjoy my palm i minus the wireless capabilities
i dont want to talk about the old fashioned lowresolution screen practically the same that came with the original palm pilot
the casio clieacute if not for the lack of wireless functions beats easily this model
and this is said by a seasoned palm fanhave had a baseline palm for a while and eagerly awaited the mobileconnected evolution
the i sounded perfect
after using it for a while i have come back down to earth and think its close but not yetpalm positives are  nice quality feel palm compatibility comes with scratchpad software and documents to gomobile positives are always on nice multimail client aol instant messengerpalm negatives are same old palm low res screen no color low light no jog dial few new applications same old buttons
essentially more expensive than a basic palm with same features except for mobile
the keyboard was kinda cool as an optional plug in  but i see it more as helping someone decide which paradigm they want pen or keyboard and then buying a pda with that integrated in like a treomobile negative mainly cost and performance
you have to go to the more expensive monthly plan to avoid overcharges and that is about x what you should pay
next problem is the performance
its an older slower technology
even in my large city it worked only ok for emails but aim was unusable as it is too sensitive to dropped packets apparently seems so
and lastly of course no voice phone ala treo i know not supposed to be
but if one was really connected one uses it like voice over ms instant messenger
last whine is that the email really wont work with corporate email
this is not a surprise but limits the real usefullness of the device for professionals untilunless their company agrees to support the thingbottom linean expensive offering that only melds a standard palm with a smslevel email service for public internet
a great attempt and nice to try but my money will go elswherefor getting information and email on the go you cant do better than thistoo badthe i is a viable optoin for the business user or highend ie
rich home user
it sports alwayson internet a battery that lasts a lot longer than most cell phones and some textbased web access although still limited by the small screen
the main advantage is that you know instantly when you receive an email with either a flashing light or a buzz signaling to you
i can imagine for a corporate exec this would be particularly useful for trading messages with your mistress while sitting through another long boring inane meeting about network synergy from a highpriced highsnooze factor consultantbut there are some big drawbacks that have to be solved before palm will be able to sell these en masse to the consumer market
price for starters
the palmnet service costs about the same as my cell service or highspeed home internet equalling the cost of the unit after about  months
this is just text folks
a lowbandwidth solution
prices must come downbecause palm needs to sell a bunch of these to convince investors to stay with its stock expect the prices to come down and fast
mark my words this product will be half what it is today by next january
they could even offer it for free with a twoyear palmnet commitmentsecond for the price they are charging you would expect at least some color
nadathird unless you are going to use the email and internet functions a lot you should consider the larger form factor of this device
it is significantly bulkier than the palm vxpalm  family yet unlike the handspring treo it doesnt replace your cell phonefourth this device is essentially trying to keep up with the blackberrys but the i should have been released two years ago
it already looks and feels dated
all you have to do is head down to your local electronics store to see all of the fancy palm osphone devices that are going to be far more useful for most people
most of them are cheaper than this device you can get some major deals from the cellular companies include color and save you major pocket spacealso dont be surprised if in about six months you start hearing about palms likely next promise to try and keep its longsuffering shareholders from jumping ship a handspring treolike device with a color screen better battery palmphone that is smaller sexier and sleeker than the i for probably the same pricedo you really want to shell out major dough for a device that will be state of the art for zero months
if you do more power to you
in a year or two the i will join your collection of ti sinclairs commodore s amigas brickphones from the s and k plasma tvs that are now k
and to tell you the truth there isnt much thats revolutionary here anyway
palm already had the palm vii which you can find for oh about zero bucks used and the palm vxphone solution and handspring will sell you a visor deluxe with phone attachment for a fraction of the is price
these are a bit less elegant but who wants to pay several hundred bucks for eleganceif the answer is you more power to you
for the rest of us we will just have to wait a while longerover all no complaints about the product
it works as advertised
however the licensing is not well advertised at all
you buy the whole cd titled bluechart americas which contains the whole of americas
however only slivers of that can be activated with the license
for example i live in the pacific northwest and that is the only regions i have access to
i cannot without buying another license use the charts for southern california or the gulf coast
i think that is bogusso buy it with both eyes wide open
if i had known i still would have made the purchase but i just wouldnt be as ticked offi knew this lens did not have stablization when purchased but even in best conditions i had difficulty getting clear sharp shotsthe problem might be with my own skills or perhaps possibly a defective lens but i didnt want to work so hard every time i wanted a decent picturei returned this lens and purchased the canon efs   mm lens
this lens is much better suited for me although more costly and still not the best lens for extremely sharp telephoto shots but fairly easy to acheive clear shakefree picturesi gave the tamron lens  stars because more skilled users no doubt will get better results than iit was a good lens that lasted a few years but roughly  years if use and the internal motor gears went bad
now our canon camera has an error message when this lens is attach
i would personally spend a little more money for better quality lensthis product is good and i paid comparitively less price for this
so i am happy to have this product with me
lens quality is equally good when i compare this to high price lensnoisy
only on rewind or fast forwardeats tapes
hardlybad recording
not from what i can seethis was a better machine than the jvc ive reported on
i couldnt get this machine to automatically program the clock for me but it did fine with the cable channels and programming the clock is pretty easyoverall this is a very easy machine to use
its my third panasonic vcr ive owned
in fact its the third vcr ive ever owned my first two being panasonics as well
my first lasted  years the second  years
hopefully this one will last as long if not longer than the previous onesunlike the jvc and many other vcrs i looked at this one does not require you to hit a timer button in order for it to go into standby recording mode
just program what you want to record whether its one time daily or weekly hit the power button and your done
you have up to  slots to program which is nice and seems to be the standard these days
my previous panasonic only had  slots so this is a vast improvement for methe remote can program various name brand tvs unlike the jvc remote which only worked with jvc tvs
also i was able to get this machine into my universal remote whereas with the jvc i couldntpicture playback is pretty clear and the colors look fine whether on a prerecorded movie or from a recording i did from the tvno tapes have been eaten and playback from the machine is not noisy at all
i guess those other people have very sensitive hearing or else they bought a bad machinefeaturewise its pretty standard
my only gripe with this machine and the reason i gave it  stars instead of possibly  is that i have experienced a problem that others have stated in that it rejects tapes sometimes
youll put in a tape sometimes and then it spits it out
after another try or two it generally takes it
the only thing i can fathom is that the spindles on the machine are not sensing the spindles on the tape correctly so it assumes its not seating correctly and spits it out
either shaking the tape or just trying it another time or two has worked for me and i have experienced this with my other two machines once in awhile but not to the degree that i experience with this machine
but that is a minor factor for my wife who  is the main user of this machineoverall this is a pretty good machine and ive had pretty good experiences with panasonic in the past which is why i finally came back to this onedo not expect much reliability from this player
i have two of these vcrs for about three months now and i have not had any problems yet they work fine
however their built quality is poor and they feel very flimsy but for the price you cannot ask too much
if it breaks i will get a new one
i had a jvc before this one and it was way worse than the panasonic
the loading mechanism in the jvc was terrible and some tapes kept getting stock in there
the loading system in the panasonic is much smoother and it takes any tapes i throw at it
i have also another panasonic which is  years old it has a blue display instead than the green one and it has a higher built quality than these new models
unfortunately most electronic components today are designed and built to break easily in order to sale more units
gone are those days where reliability was the most important aspect it just isnt profitable anymore
overall good to fairive owned this camera for about a year now
overall i am pleased with its performance but in retrospect i think i would have been happier with the canon powershot g or g
in ideal lighting situations the camera performs very well and produces very good images
battery life has been good and compact flash is by far the best storage format
however in lessthanideal conditions i believe there are better cameras on the marketthere two areas in which this camera has disappointed me are flash photography the stated range of the flash unit on this camera is a bit shorter than others  ft and in realworld conditions subjects appear very dimly lit in the upper end of that range
other cameras in the same priceresolution category have flash ranges closer to  ft
time between shots the camera is rated at seconds between shots in normal shooting mode
the canon powershot for example can take backtoback shots in  seconds
this has been a problem for me when trying to capture movement and action shotsthat being said this camera is significantly less expensive than the canon powershot gghope this helpsthis was one of the worst yet best ideas palm madethe screen is smaller than any other palm yet it was in color
also there were noted problems with recharging
my wife went through two ms that had problems with recharginglosing charge
i ended up getting her the m with no problems
the idea was great because it appeals to the young generation with interchangeable face platesgiving it the memory expandability was great for a little more you could get the mxx seriesdont waste you money on any mxx series
if you want an inexpensive palm go withmonochrome  palm zirezire color  palm zire  or tungsten ei bought this palm model after losing my m during a business trip
instead of purchasing the same old model i went for an upgrade with the m since it looked identical to my old unit plus it had color
the process of migrating the old data from my pc to the new unit was very simple fortunately i kept my data synchronized in my pc on a frequent basisthe m works exactly the same as my old m making the learning curve minimal
i also noticed that the stylus graffiti recognition is more effective than in my m reducing the backspacing and correctingthe unit includes a hotsync cradle which is not only used for synchronizing but also to recharge the batteries
obviously the cradle requires electric poweri found the cradle a bit heavy and bulky and difficult to store in a notebooks briefcase
the engineers at palm should have considered for those of us who travel making the cradle more compact and lightweight
you have no choice but to bring it with you everywhere since it is required to recharge the units shortlasting internal battery
now  a bit about battery lifein my opinion i consider the ms battery life to be very short
my m used  aaa batteries that lasted more than a month
the ms last a day or two and possibly less with heavy use
you need to get used to recharging it daily
fortunately you can reduce the screen brightness by lightly tapping the power button while the unit is on to save battery lifein summarypros  palms reliability and reputation ease of use upgradeable enough basic memory mb clear display with good colorscons heavy and bulky hotsync cradle very short battery lifeif you use your palm for personal purposes andor do not travel a lot with it then you may disregard the consif you do a lot of traveling you should consider obtaining a unit with a longerlasting battery and a more compact cradlerecharger starsi loved my first m which lasted about a year
when the case i cracked i bought two more for my husband and me
both of ours cracked after about a year plus the os is not compatible with xp for syncronizing
plus i had a lot of problems with getting a recharger that would work or last long for the m
i have since bought the zire  which i have had for more than  years and the case is still intactwell first of all i am a technology addicted personi am migrating from the pocket pc world to this palm world due to corporate standard
this palm m is light has a cool design and has many nice applications it must be said
but what i dont like is the lack of options for production
with my pocket pc i could use pcmcia cards and share my notebooks modem i could have a video card and use my powerpoint on a presentation i could use my gprs card and have the ipaq working as a cellphone as a browser and so onthe integration with windows is nice nothing to complain
the applications that come with this m is nice especially for the documents to go
i do encourage people to spend some more bucks i guess price and have the upgrade deal for the pro since you can then download pdf files and edit your powerpoint presentationsthere is a company margicom that is about to release an sd card that will allow users to have a vga projector connected to this m cool
unfortunately i was told by palm support that only the blackwhitescreened m will have wireless internet capability there is no planned sd card for the palm m so far
the only wireless available is the bluetooth card that allows you to use your bluetooth compatible cellphone as a gateway as you see far from the pocket pc seamless technology
i hope i dont have to rent a uhaul trailler to carry on all my bulky addons
i do encourage people to also spend some more bucks and get the extended warranty from palm
they cover broken lcds
and it is about  of the devices street priceso making a long story shortjust buy this device if you only use a pda for gaming avantgo offline pages such as stock news etc
on a traffic jam or at the airport quick review of a presentation on an airplane with no chance to use your pda for performing the presentation quick review of a spreadsheet and email revision between a meeting and the otherif you really want a pda to substitute your notebook most of the time disregard the price difference and get a pocket pc
otherwise you will just get upsetthis item is a wonderful tool to organize my life
i cant function without it i like it so much
precisely why i had to give it a  star rating
it cant seem to hold a charge reliably
when the battery reads nearly full one minute an hour later i have lost all power and data necessitating a hard reset
palm will not stand behind this defect because it was an quotopen box itemquot they will sell me a new model for over  but the m is not available except as quotrefurbishedquot i dont dare go that route again and recommend that others not buy open box items
they claim to have been thoroughly checked before resale but i believe either my switch or my battery is defective
because i like the model so well i am still trying to locate a quotnewquot one on other websites that might be affordableadvice buy new and back up often on hotsynchdont rely on palmmy doubts proofed right
no major improvements compared to the  device
its easy so become familiar with this handheld but you wont be satisfied with the rather small range of applications and the poor software lineup
dont know why palm is always boasting about their products
they are no match for an uptodate pocket pc
you could expect more value for your money
the cpu is definately outdated and the displays iow resolution makes serious applications still unavaillable for palm users
though i own a  now but i dont think ill use it very often
rather stick to my compaq   its heavy and too big but it gets done all thinkable tasksthe palm  is not really bad but it makes you feel naked when confronted with complex tasks that require professional software solutions
its just an organizer  a very flash one of coursei did lots of research on the m  and was very sure that this was the handheld for me
i was very disapointed with picture display and some other stuff
this is when i realized i shouldve gotten a pocket pcbut its still pretty good for taking notes or a to do listthe  g is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to  mm but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag
ive found my lens to be pretty soft throughout the zoom range mine is soft even stopped down and relatively slow to focus d
the lens performs best in well lit environments and is capable of taking high quality pictures but may require more post processing and effort than faster lenses to achieve these resultsi bought the lens mainly to get the zoom range at an affordable price but plan to replace it in the near future probably will sell the lens
the build quality isnt the best but it is still pretty durable
recommended for beginning photographers or photographers on a budget like myself but others may be left wanting more
still it is sold at a great pricethe co did a good job helping me to send it back i did not get the leans i was looking for so i sent it back and you did a great job helping me do sotried this lens but it was soft to the point of being out of focus felt flimsy very light plastic and even in the brightest outdoor setting agonizingly slow to focus on my d
often the af overfocused and went back to blurry or refused to focus at alli expected to like this nikon lens more than this and am now looking for a sigma or tamron where ill get the macro feature as well and for the same priceone good thing about this lens if you dont mind a supersoft image is it is extremely lightweight which is very enjoyablereturned itwhile i really wanted to purchase a vr lens i couldnt afford it at the time so i decided to purchase this lens for some neighborhood wildlife shotsoverall performance great but you must have a tripod to avoid the likely blur to to no vibration reductioni just purchased the vr version today and will be selling this one sooni neglected to read the reviews so hopefully this will stop someone else from making the same mistake i did
autofocus is not an option with the d dx and several other common models something i think the description neglects to mentionthat said its still a very good lensthe product description was really poor on amazon for this product
and it says that this zoom is compatible to nikon slr d
but it fails to specify that only manual focus is possible for all nikon slr
fortunately the price is very reasonable
i dont mind to use manual focus after all
additionally the quality of photos seems to be fine
but i will know more after few weeks
i would give  stars if bought this zoom by knowing there is no autofocus function for nikon dthis was an ok first zoom lens purchase
ultimately i wound up buying the sigma mm f dc macro os hsm lens within two weeks of purchasing this nikon mm fg af nikkor slr camera lensthe pda worked fine in fact as perfect as it comes for the basic operations
the memory stick is great especially if you have other sony equipment that uses it
however after two months of use it all of a suddent went dead
the usual tricks like resetting etc
failed to revive it and sony technician had me send it for service express mail and all paid by the warranty
 days later they are still quotworking on itquot and the web page says that they can hold it for  working days ie
 days
imagine being without your phone book and pocket calendar for  weeks
this is totally unacceptable
i wonder if other manufacturers are any better
the only soluiton i can imagine is the quotjaguarquot method buy two
not very funny is iti have no complains about this clie
i let go of my ipaq because it was too heavy and large to carry it with me all the time
so i decided to get the t
the palm os works with less memory requirements than windows ce so you get much more storage capacity with a kb clie than with a kb ipaq
however i do find the display too small for my needs
i can barely tip the letters i want in the virtual keyboard with the stylus
also if you use quickbooks excel lookalike the display is just not enoughin addition this unit is not mp equiped
the built in speaker is deficienti gave it as a gift
but i did see it in action and very impressed
the quality and setup was well worth it
and very satisfiedi thought i could use these to replace my  woofers in a home stereo speaker cabinet
i was greatly disappointed
though the speakers appear to be very well made they are ohm speakers and even when driven with a  watt channel reviever do not give the booming bass that i expectedas ive worked in pc repair freelance consulting and network administration ive learned having the capability to do things like update antivirus software for a client usually if an antivirus program is going to fail its on install or the first update its nice to be able to hook into a high speed connection even if the persons computer doesnt have a network card or even a modemive also used it to troubleshoot existing connections this nic does have leds so it makes troubleshooting pretty easy although you can still run into  problems dont be surprised if your hub is glowing amber instead of green it means your connection is only running at  mbps versus  and bypassing bad network cardsas it is portable it is my own personal toolkit which only really consists of stuff i use often enough to justify limited spaceat usb  the maximum speed for this product is  mbpswhich means if youre going to use it for an internet connection it probably will do just fine most internet connections youre a very lucky person to have even a  mbps connection but for networking it will run almost  slower than a standard network cardi got a brochure recently for the much awaited  which runs at  mbps although im not sure if the  network card will run that fast
at the very least i imagine it will be true  but im still not sure when that will be releasedas for this products durability it is slightly fragile but ive had mine for over six months now and i havent had a days problem with it treat it gently and itll last a good long timeif your in repair id suggest one of these and a usb drive of at least  megs i kept tapping out my  although  is still great for pulling drivers from your working machine to one that probably doesnt connect to the internet or pulling a sample of a corrupted file back to the shop for analysisi picked one of these up to serve as the network adapter for my tivo
it worked right out of the box with no problems but the connector is just way too sensitive
if the network cable gets moved in any way the connection is lost
very annoyingim sure this is a very handy product for some applications but for more permanent setups i would sooner choose a larger more stable network adapteri bought this because i did not want to dedicate one of my lab machines to print services
this was one of the most challenging device setup i have ever experienced
all of my networking equipment is linksys linksys  port wap linksys pc card linksys pci card etc
i eventually gave up an called tech support and was able to get one machine printing
after much trial and error i was able to get all my windows xp and linux machines to successfully use the devicehowever i find i must reset the device unplug power cord wait  seconds plug back in each day
for some reason even with a static ip the device hangs and i get print errorsi gave up in disgust and bought a netgear print server that was both easy to setup and works flawlesslyi finally got this to work on my wireless network
my entire network is linksys and until i bought this server i had been mighty impressed with the easy set up of most linksys products
not so here
im a professional network analyst and i still had major hassles getting this thing to work
it finally does albeit without wep
after all the hassles so far just to get it working im not sure if i want to risk messing it up by setting up wep
beginners or nonexperts should look elsewhereim using the wps  on a dual platform xp and apple os x wireless lan connected to a cable modem via an apple airport set up as a dhcp router providing nat to  workstations  xp  w  mac
setting up the wps  is every bit as daunting as many of the other reviews of this product claim
my biggest problem was getting windows and apple printing protocols to work together
the win setup is fairly ok following the manual but  depending on the rest of your wireless network you could spend a lot of time chasing little problems
the wps  defaults to channel   thats ok if youre using a linksys routeraccess point
if not you have to move the radio channel or youll think its dead
setting up via the ethernet port and then repowering in order to scan the wireless lan is another problem but if you let it get a dhcp address from your router and youve got the right radio channel you should be able to access the box from the web admin or the quotbiadminquot utility wirelessly
the easiest way to set up apple printing is through ip printing
with the os x unix drivers available from  gimpprint you should be able to get almost any printer working
i started with on old deskjet c just to make sure everything was working before i ordered a new laser printer
linksys could save their tech staff which i didnt call and their customers a lot of grief if theyd put a few sample configurations in the manual and provided a few resource links
the paltry set of apple utilities in the linksys disk are in a folder called quotunsupportedquot and mainly pertain to appletalk under os   dont bother
go straight for ip printing
linksys doesnt even tell you the default queue name  quotlpquot worked and its all the little stuff like that which keeps this from being a   when you get it working its great and the price cant be beat but its really nowhere near up to the state of the plug and play art with either windows or apple products
on the plus side you can adminster the server from an embedded web utility over wireless so if youre all apple you actually can get it running
just push the reset button while connected to a printer and the box will print its diags including current ip address
point a browser there and youre in
again this is not well documented and if youre using a wireless machine be sure to note the radio channel and reset your wifi card to the same frequency
i can see why people just send them back though and for any dead radio issues be sure all your wireless devices are on the same channel
lastly if this server is part of a wireless lan and not used stand alone you must set it as an infrastructure device not adhoc
again poorly documented
i found this by reading the help file in the biadmin utility and its burried deep
as a rule always get a diag printout using a short push of the reset button and make sure the ip address and radio channels match up
this will solve a lot of problems
linksys products are robust and reliable and im sure now that its working the wps  will be toolinksys markets this unit as having a vpn server that you can use to access the network its connected to remotely ie connect to your office network from your home computer
but be wary that this is not a simple task is nearly undocumented and may require additional rd party software if you have windows xp home edition
i spent more than a week and a half trying to make a vpn connection from my home pc several tech support conversations and used several forums and was never able to connectthis is a rather basic player but it does play mps from folders and subfolders and allows you to navigate around to find the song you like to hearbut ive been having some problems reading some of my mp discs
im not sure if its my cd writer the mp file itself or this player
the mp songs will play for the first  seconds and stops dead
the very same disc will play no problem on my pcand because it uses a nonstandard sized power jack i couldnt use my existing portable cd power adaptor for it even though it is the same voltae and polarity
i view this as a disadvantage because i already have the home and car power supplies for my other portable cd playerstherere other quotnonamequot brands out there that could play mp wma vcds and even has fmam radio builtin for slightly more
with the glitches ive experienced the only thing thats still good about this player is the rio brandname which by the way has already been sold now known as sonic bluetwo lines lcd navigationsec anti shockdont compare to expensive one
remember youre paying what you geti bought one has openning problem when i lift the player it will stop and lcd display the cover is open but the cover doesnt open
i figured it out becuase the screws is not tight enough screw them tight
maybe the detection stick is no long enough i posted little aa super glue at the end of the stick makes the stick can press the openclose botton firmly if you apply that please wait the super glue solid before closing the cover otherwise you will get problem
then i fixed it with no problem now
cannot doubt it is cheap made because of the price
you cannot get a navigation lcd display and program select mpcd player that cheap in the market
so that is greatfor this price please dont require very professional stuff on it
its included earbuds must be replace cheaply made use sony bass earbuds will make the player more valuablefor rio sp series i guess the laser head is cheap made
that is right many people complain it is only last a year or two then doesnt read disc
sometimes depends how you use it
dont use it to read malmade cd or pirated cd
and give a break to it
that will last longeri am very satisfied by its price batteries life and navigationit is better look than sp sp  uglycons not easy to control
philips exp  series did a good job in saving batteries and controlling
sound quality is not well compares to philipssonytdkyou get what you pay for
this wont compare very well to budget name brand subs
but it will fill in some bass
not so stable when pushed
but at low volume levels it can produce decent lows
not very hard hitting but does the job if you want a cheap small sub to warm up your sound
would be good to add balanced bass to a factory car stereo
if you have an aftermarket system the bass will not be enough
i was pushing this sub with an amp matched to true rms ratings of this sub at ohmsi bought this to replace the factory sub woofer that failed you cannot get the factory sub anymore
it required holes to be drilled came with six and box had eight but the depth was fine and required no other modification to fit
the sound with the factory amp is just ok  the factory magnet was heavier so i am thinking that is part of the problemi bought two of these speakers they worked good with my  watt amp then one of them blew
ig i cant complain for price but still come on
hope i have better luck with the pyramid  in subs
i just ordered the other daythis is a great card and a great idea from a reliable company  as long as you dont have a complex system running windows after i installed this card on my system all chaos broke loose
this eventually caused windows  to become corrupt and crash and burn
i had to totally rebuild my system from scratch wasting many hours
so it is buyer bewareit turns out that this card needs four irqs
now i already had a soundcards a couple of  adaptec brand scsi cards and a graphics adapter
problem is that under windows  all of these pci cards are assigned irq 
the only way to prevent this on my system anyway is to disable acpi power management  a job bigger than ben hur
result hardware conflict system freezeups driver corruption and bsods blue screen of deathin summary the duoconnect  is a good card
but if you run windows  have a lot of pci cards and you dont know an irq from acpi or bsod then better stay away from it
go for something simpler like an adaptec  i am told that the duoconnect  installs without problems on windows xp which is more flexible with irqsyet i do not entirely blame the adaptec company for the problem  though they could have warned me the unsuspecting consumer about the insallation risks in the marketing brochures
so therefore only  starsi cant fault adaptec on their very good support
adapter cards from other companies are cheaper than adaptec brand but the adaptec support is worth the extra money
which is why i replaced this card with another card from the same company
adaptec refunded my original purchase price but not the many wasted hours
so therefore at least  starsfirst and foremost please note that these speakers have changed since they were first introduced
this review is more of a comparison between the old set which i originally purchased in  and that now has a flaky din input plug huge known issue with the older model and this new set that was purchased in november notable differences the notorious din plug was changed so it doesnt stick straight out of the subwoofer potentially resulting in less failures
this is probably the biggest plus of the new set the wires on the satellite speakers are now hardwired instead of being connected via mm plugs
this is a drawback for those who wanted to use higher gauge wires for the speakers to potentially increase sound quality however it also fixed the issue of the plugs producing static if moved even if the movement was the result of sound playing from the speakers
with the old set i found myself sometimes moving the plugs around to prevent dropoutsstatic and now this issue is resolved in comparison with the old subwoofer the new one definitely sounds boomy and less deep in sound
this could be due to not having a breakin period but it was definitely an issue as i was no longer pleased with the bass being produced
i could no longer get the subwoofer to seamlessly blend between the satellites and the subwoofer as the boomyness always made it apparent that the bass was coming from under my desk
this was not an issue with the old model everas a side note and possibly the cause of this the subwoofer is now  pounds lighter than the older one there is no longer a power switch on the subwoofer so you cant turn them off without unplugging them from the outlet
not a huge deal as idle power draw is low but this might be annoying for those with power consumption concernsall in all i decided not to keep the new set
it seems like they cut every corner in this newer model and while that had a pro or two the overall result is a lower quality product at the same price point
ill be looking at the logitech zs now as i have always been impressed with logitech build quality and warranty support something i cant say about klipsch who want to nickel and dime you for replacements even when its a known issuemy dad takes audio fidelity pretty seriously and bought me these for me as a graduation present in  since they fit well into a dorm room
i have absolutely no complaints about the sound quality  its better than one would expect from such an inexpensive setuphowever in the past seven years two major problems have cropped up
the first involved lots of cracking and popping in one speaker a few years back
i dont remember exactly what happened but i was able to fix it by disconnecting and doing some work inside of the control pod i saw online that others had similar problems and was able to follow a standard fix
in the last year i have started having the same problem with the din connector for the control pod as everyone else with the sound going in and out in one speaker unless the cord was fixed in exactly the right position
i looked at it and it seems that its not a bad connection right near the plug in the cord ie the way headphone cords often fail right near the jacks but rather that the plugsocket connection had too much play in it
i opened up the subwoofer  to see if i could just hardwire the control pod into it but the area i would need to access is encased in epoxy
someone here suggested cannibalizing the ps connection from an old keyboard so i will probably try that but its looking like i probably need a new set of speakersthis speaker set does produce amazing sound and i did get several years of use from them before the plugs that connect the speakers caused issues and the sound would not feed properly to the speakers
after a lot of fiddling and fussing around with the faulty plugs i decided to just quit trying to fix it and replaced the entire system
so yes they sound great but it was a real bummer to have to retire this system just because the plugs they use to attach the speakers dont lastupon unboxing i was surprised to find no power switch and a made in china sticker on the sub
not good
so i hooked it up to my iphone and it sounded a bit too boomy with the sub adjusted to the  oclock position per the instructions
watched a movie on laptop and the audio clarity is definitely there but system lacks depth
perhaps the drivers need break in time
for a  analog setup im not too impressed
this system has been around for awhile and folks rave about it but i think newer versions are getting cheaper
lack of a power switch means current flowing through components  wearing them down
lots of reliability problems toothe speakers do sound good for  computer speakers
slightly better for music than the logitech z set which ive had longer than thesethe build quality is where they lose the battle
these are some fragile speakersthey began crackling and popping no matter what if any signal was going to them
then i started to notice the smell of burning electronics coming from the left satellite the one with the controlswill definitely be the last klipsch product i purchasei bought these for the company i work for to be used on sales rep and training personels laptops for presentations
it is good enough for that
for myself i bought the bose companion  they are killer
no graphic equalizer no sound controls etc
these were designed for great sound and the engineers did not want people messing them up trying to adjust sound controls
no need to any way
just wish they were a bit louder but then the wife would get mad at me ha hai bought this set to use with my  samsung plasma tv
they look great but dont sound as spectacular as some of the other reviewers claim
i will not claim to be an audiophile but i do like crisp treble  which these speakers lack and the bass  for lack of better terms pukes out at relatively low volume
the subwoofer is either underpowered too small or not sufficiently baffled
it distorts easily on movie sound tracks where there is a slight rumble
yes there is an adjustment for bass gain however it does not manage the sound very effectively
i would like to mount the speakers next to the tv on the wall
the speakers do not have wall mounts and the subwoofer box will have to be placed near them  its not huge but too big to be mounted behind my tv and funny looking on the audio rack so placement will be a challenge
overall im somewhat disappointed with klipsch  i always thought they were super high end  i would rank this set above a logitech for appearance  maybe quality but way below a bose system  i wish i would have bought instead
i may just go back to my polk powered subs and towers  sometimes the sweetness of low price never equals the bitterness of low qualitybought the klipsch  speaker system in a retail store not on amazon
previously owned computer sound systems include a  monsoon system and a powered sony  speaker system wood cabinet the sony is the better sounding of the twothe reviews on amazon provided useful suggestions and information on these speakers
a few reviews contained suggestions about modifying aspects of the sound quality such as plugging the bass port to subdue the very prominent lowend
there are also many reviews stating that these speakers lack midrange this is very truemy system had the same problem another reviewer had with the right satellite speaker cutting out
after messing around with the configuration i discovered that the satellite speaker with the controls on it seems to work fine when connected as the left speaker but has a cutout problem when connected as the right speaker
being right handed i originally configured it as the right speakeri own both these and a set of logitech zs and i strongly prefer the zs
the sound to my ears is just more full with much clearer crisper bass response on the logitech speakers
they also have better dynamic range than the klipschsthe first set of klipschs i bought were defective thank you amazon for making the exchange so simple
i dont find the build quality quite up to that of the logitechsthe one advantage that the klipsch speakers have for me is that they have an auxiliary input into which one can plug an ipod or other audio device
this is why i bought them and that is a great feature that works beautifully
i dont understand why logitech didnt put such a simple feature on their topoftheline speakersso i would say if you need the option of using these speakers with an mp player go with klipsch
if not go with logitechthese sound incredible
i have had my set for  years
today the amp died
a check of many online forums indicates this is nothing new
in fact many people experience the same problem at right around the year mark
so if you want to spend close to  for speakers that sound wonderful for about  years you cant beat klipsch
i however will be giving some logitech zs a tryi had these speakers for a few years and generally they were pretty good speakers although a bit more expensive
unfortunately i just barely moved my sub woofer and the cords din connector broke off making them essentially worthless
i guess there is a replacement part but i ended up scrapping my set for something elseive had about  or  sets of computer speakers
i love speakers
i am a audio enthusiast and spend a lot of time upgrading my computer home and car sound systems as a hobby
i really wanted to like these speakers
my roommate has them and his have worked perfectly for the six or seven month duration he has had them for
unfortunately that is not the case with mine
i ordered these speakers roughly  months ago
since that time i have had not one but two control pods with some significant problems
the first one that i had was immediately inoperable
if you touched the volume dial it would distort the sound and make the volume randomly change to either full volume if you have heard this speakers that is loud
 or no volume
once i got this replaced the new control pod had a defective male plug the one that goes into the back of your computer and results in a loud buzzing unless the plug cable is pulled at the perfect angle
additionally i also get random sound distortion for half a second at a time while i am listening to anything on these speakersso far as good things go
my roommate has had these speakers for months and had no problems with them
his work perfectly
when they are working these speakers are really nice
the highs are fairly crisp although the lows do have some distortion when the bass is pushed too far
by that i mean that you sometimes need to put it lower than the recommended setting which is only about  of the potential bass in order to avoid some lows that are not meant to go through the bass from bleeding through
it can make the low male voices in some movies or music sound a lot more muddy than it should be
fortunately this is generally the case when listening to stuff on a very loud volume settingi would probably raise my review a star if my speakers had worked as well as my roommates
this is a great system for the price but you are gambling on getting a good one or a bad egg and from what i have read after reading a lot of reviews on here i realized that people never really give their products time to have problems before they post a perfect review on forums etc
the volume control pod is a major issue  replacement and you should expect to have to replace it a minimum of one time if you are going to purchase these speakersupdate i am still using these speakers and still hold a soft spot in my heart for them
however i would like to make an additional comment about a problem that i had overlooked when originally writing this review
the sound quality is great but these speakers are incapable of low volume via the knobs on the front of the speaker
if you try to turn the knob below about  youll hear some pretty distorted sound and it will only come out of one speaker mines the left my roommate has had the same problem and after speaking with another friend that happened to have these speakers he has experienced the same thing
this isnt a horrible issue as you can always change the sound on the computer itself and it wont impact the sound quality but its a definite design flaw that is really irritating if you just like to use the hardware to change your sound settings
aside from that i am still loving these speakersi replaced my ailing logitech  sound system with this one
price wasnt a big consideration although it cost less than my logitechs
reviews were decent and its a brand name after all
these will play nicely at high voiumes if youre into that sort of thing
the satellite speakers are crisp
bass is tight but weak
i have the bass knob cranked all the way up and overall i like the soundi would compare these to comparable logitechs and maudioi bought these as a replacement for a home stereo system that used a receiver  satellites and a sub which i moved to another room
i have these plugged directly into a technics record player
they definitely sound good but as a home stereo replacement i think they are a little lacking in body or mid range
i know they are designed as computer speakers and they are very good for that but they are pretty expensive compared to the sound i get out of my  alteclansing  set i use at workwhich i think is also very goodoverall i feel like you can hear the small size of the speakers and that the sub is too responsible for filling out the sound in the mid range
to my ear they dont blend very wellas in i feel like i can hear the music from the sub and the music from the satellites separately
dont get me wrong the set sounds good its just that if you are looking to use this as a home stereo replacement i think youre better off buying a receiver and some larger speakers which i wish i would have donein summary they are too expensive for computer speakers for my budget and they are too undersized for a home stereo replacementi guess i was hoping for some of the midrange clarity that bose speakers are able to get in this price range
the sound is okay
volume is good but when i turn the knob i dont like its stiff feel and it makes noise on adjustment
maybe i got a defective unit
the reviewers that comment about the bass being muddy are understated
the subwoofer simply adds mud to the sound rather than any kind of bass definition
not a happy camper heremy suspicion is that most of the stellar reviews here are written by individuals who expected lesssome backgroundive owned computers since i purchased my first in  an amiga for those who werent born yetive had my share of computer speakers and most were lacking in one way or another
i usually wait until i simply cant stand the sound for another day and then start shopping
my last speaker set purchased eight years ago was a links computer ltd lk with sub woofer and satellites
had a great sound with adjustable base like they do today
it became scratchy distorted and then pitifully unbearablei did chose this product in the same fashion that i always purchase things on the internet  based on product description price and customer reviews
if there isnt a good product description or no customer reviews i move on in my searchhaving said that this speaker set compares to my lk system in clarity and function
i paid  for my lk set and at  this in my mind was expensive but i had to justify getting them anywayi dont know if youll be satisfied but i doubt that youll be dissatisfiedkind of pricy to only work for  months
the secondary board fried for some reason
i might have given them a reasonable doubt if it was the power board but this could not have been caused by a surge
i am looking for a replacement set that will sound as good as these but from another manufactureri love this system when it works
unfortunately i have had two failures of the control pod which includes the volume knob creating heavy static and interference with the left speaker
so adios
i have just ordered a bose system that my wife has had for  years that has had no issuesi am kicking myself for not starting with these speakers in the first place
after buying an alteclansing  system with no midrange and a constant sub woofer hum i decided to increase my budget
while i cant say that i like the look of the satellites as much as i liked the compact altectlansings there is no arguing with how they soundwhich can be summed up in one word  wowthese speakers have no bass and treble controlsand they do not need them
the mix is perfect regardless of source
they do however have a subwoofer bass level control mounted on one of the satellites which allows you to tone things down for late night dvd viewingwhile keeping the base on the satellites intactso whats not to like
well not much franklybut here there are a few features that i would like to see refined the wiring is hokey
i really wish that the input source went into the sub and that each satellite had only a single wire connecting it to the sub a common design for other  systems
instead the control satellite has three wires exiting the back of the satellite  a flimsy speaker wire a hardwired input source line and a hardwired control line to the sub
also as mentioned the stereo wire that connects both sats to the sub is both flimsy and further exacerbating matters customfeaturing a mm stereo plug on one end and bare wire meant for submounted dual clips on the other
many users eventually report static with this setup after time and end up replacing the wiring the power switch is on the back of the subnot on the control satellite the grills while not completely unattractive could be refined
that said take them off and these speakers look pretty cooladmittedly some of those complaints may be picky but this is a mid price range multimedia  speaker system so i expected betterespecially with regards to the  wiring
that said the sound is stellarso four stars
when klipsch works out a couple of those other issuesor cuts the price in halfthen i will award that elusive fifth star
february  updateand a warningeight years have passed since i wrote my original review and amazon is still listing this product
in fact the product is still selling well
unfortunately it is not the same producteven though it shows up under the same amazon listingthe old klipsch promedia  was a very high quality set
thus it was very popular
so what did klipsch do
guessthe sub now weighs  pounds lessfive
does it matter
seems so since folks who have owned both this version and the old version state that the bass is no longer beautifully integrated into the sound profile with the sats
now it is fairly boomy
well how about that hokey wiring that i noted  years ago
did they improve it
no  in fact its worse
the speaker wire that comes out of the back of each sub and that must each travel to the sub is now hardwired
klipsch claims that this change is an improvement
many of us disagreewhat else
well for years people complained that the sats didnt have a power switch and that you had to use the switch on the sub to power the system off
so what did klipsch do
they removed the power switch from the sub
you now need to unplug the sub to turn the system off
yes unplugwhats worse is that the price now ranges from the old price  to well over so should you buy this system
well thats a tough call
frankly while the system seems to have gone down a few notches it is still probably a far better option than most  systems
you just cant get decent bass with small driversregardless of what folks try to sell youunfortunately gone are the days when you could go to a local bm and audition a full aisle of computer speakers
perhaps thats due to falling profit margins at bms the need to diversify at such outlets or the fact that many people now use laptops instead of desktops
regardless the situation remains  you must now rely on online reviews and roll the dice
reviews like this one
in my opinion this system is probably not a bad option if you can find it for  but i wouldnt pay any more
if you had the old version youll probably be disappointed even if you can find it for that price
personnaly if i was looking today i would probably spend  beans more and get a  swan mw systemand tell klipsch to stick their improvements im disappointed with this system
i got it to replace my creative gigaworks t   not because i was unhappy with the creative system but because i got the impression the klipsh would be that much better than it
one of the big reasons was that the creative systems subwoofer is fairly low watts and im a basshead
the thing is though the creative subwoofer whatever the wattage is produced super clean super deep rich boomswell i got the klipsch and unpacked it
my first disappointment was that the satellites are connected by connecting stripped speaker wire to screw terminals on the sub
not a huge deal but less clean that a plugin system
next i noticed the satellites are roughly  times the size of the creative satellites
of course i expected them to produce even more than the creative system and so i wasnt concernedafter wiring it up i went to go turn the system on expecting some control on the left speaker but found none
did a bit of research theres no way to turn these damn things off other than unplugging the entire system
yeah ridiculous
so to unplug it from the your computer you have to turn the volume all the way down to silence the crackle it makesso ive got the system wired up and am ready to hear the mind boggling sound
turn it all on and it sounds marginally better than my awesome creative system it was sitting right to
and
it sounded marginally better than the creative system
i mean marginallythis speaker set sounds great dont get me wrong
but there is one huge flaw in the design that they have not sorted out after all of these years
the din plug
once this goes bad your entire nice system is utter trash
what sounded great is now dead because of one input to the sub that powers the entire unit aside from the ac
wiggling the cable to try to get it in the perfect spot to get sound
because of this issue i have decided not to purchase another set
all you have to do is google it
this is a known issue for a long timei bought a set of these speakers in 
the sound quality was awesome bass is crazy strong simple black design is great satellite controls and connectors are greatlate one night last month they started to emit a very high volume buzzing tone out of nowhere
i got up disconnected power and went back to bed
tested later and one of the satellites has gone bad
amp seems ok either channel will drive the good satellitei bought a new set yesterday at bb
noticed that the floor model has hardwired satellitesno more miniplugs
darn
then i noticed that the box seemed unusually light
so i weighed it
the new set weighs about  pounds
old set is about  poundsthats a very big difference in weight
makes me think that the current models use much lightercheaper drivers and ampso im going to make an extra effort to repair or replace the old satellite before i open the box on this newer lighter version of the pm just fyi to anyone else who has an old set and is considering replacing themi purchased this speaker system about  years ago and it has been a constant lovehate relationship
there are so many pros and cons for these speakers
im not gonna go into all of them just the ones i considered to be most relevant in my usesthe pros includeamazing sound quality and range
i love feeling the rumble and with this sub i rarely turned the tone knob above about a third for a movie and maybe halfway or so for some hard trance metal rock and even some older rap
the mids were clean and clear
so clear that i could hear someone coughing in a live recording of mannheim steamroller
and the highs
unreal
you can put in some old big band jazz like maynard ferguson and there is almost no distortion to the screaming trumpet
no matter if i was watching a movie via my laptop jamming to pandora through my phone or using an old sony walkman the sound was always superbvery strong design
considering the made in china sticker i am amazed that i only just managed to destroy this system
but in a way this was also a downfall in my opinion
more on that in a minutesmall footprint
i originally purchased these to install int he sleeper of my kenworth wl
a semi notorious for having one of the smallest and tightest living quarters in the industry
the component speakers are perfect for either hard mounting on a wall or using the permanently mounted feet
if you use them on the desktop the foot design makes it easy to keep a tape or paperclip dispenser on them
the sub also has a fairly small footprint and since it is ported and side facing there are very few limitations on where you can set iton one of the satellites there are stereo jacks for both an extra audio input device and an output jack for headphonesvolume and tone controls are very simple and very sensitive
the included amplifier definitely does what it is intended forand the consas stated earlier this is built quite well
so much so that if there is even a small problem you cannot fix it but must replace the entire getup
a lightning bolt fried my surge protector and managed to do damage to the power module of the amp
because of this all three speakers are useless now
the amp is coated with a layer of melted glues making it impossible to even remove a chip for any kind of inspectionthe wiring is very poorly designed in many ways
first you have to run the obvious power and speaker cables
no problem right
this system adds in another wire which in my opinion is the weak link of this whole package
you must run an extra wire from the primary satellite speaker to the sub alongside the normal speaker wire
this extra wire is the control tether for the volume and tone controls nothing more
and when plugged in it pushes the sub enclosure a few inches out for fear of crimping the wires
the jack for this wire is also very temperamental
after a few days of use i would have to sit there and wiggle the wire to get the circuits to closethe power switch location sucks
the toggle is located near the bottom back side of the sub
this means that you need to be very nimble if you want to put the box out of sight
the switch is also located right by the above noted temperamental wire so bumping it out of place when turning on the speakers can be more than a mild annoyanceso with these things considered would i buy them again
probably not this particular design
while i absolutely love the sound quality i think that the wiring issue and the fact that you cannot do any sort of upkeep is a really big fault
i hate having  speakers here that all sound great but i cant use because of one little circuit board getting fried
i hate having to go out and buy a whole new system because of this
so for a home entertainment system in a house i plan on dieing in i would definitely consider installing a plethora of klipsch components and speakers
but for anything less i doubt i willtoo much base for my ipod
i use outside just for listening to music
thumper base
but has very loud capabilityas other reviewers have mentioned this system is loud and has excellent sound overall
im keeping the system but wanted to point out a few problems that i see with the design contrary to reports saying there is a power button on the subwoofer an inconvenient location to be sure my system actually has no power button at all
this means i have to use a power strip with a switch or manually unplug the system whenever im done using it
quite a hassle
 the speakers are nice but the stands look a little cheap
stamped metal
 there is a subwoofer adjustment knob but no tone adjustment knob
it would have been nice to designin a  basic eq or at least a basstreble adjustment knob as the speakers are a little bass heavy
 the system is made in china and smells as such
your house will smell like benzene for an hour or so
and youll have lots of nonrecyclable styrofoam packaging to deal with
 lastly i dont want to complain but the speakers are so loud that youll often have to be careful to keep the volume knob less than  of max
i wouldnt want to be anywhere near the computer with these speakers on im satisfied with the purchase and performance overall but i would have been willing to pay double if the system would have had a little more attention to detaili thought this was a great router at first for the price and it used to work well too
lately its been rebooting itself and refreshing constantly
contacted tech support and had a brain boggling experience from this supposedly technical support guy who didnt know jack
he kept telling me quotno youre wrongquot and quotits the ispquot
id like to think that im not your typical user having worked in various departments within it for over  yearsim the third person ive known personally whos had very similar problems as i have with this specific model of dlink router
if youre going to buy a router dont go for dlink
ive heard some really good things from some of my colleagues about smc in particular and also linksys and netgearneedless to say ill be looking to buy a new router sooni owned this item before
it used to work correctly and at some point started crashing every day
when i recover it the next day it will crash again
eventually it stopped working one day and ended up in the dumpster
that prompted me to move to the diup
i dont recommend iti brought this memory on the recommendation of reviewer r geissman rlgeissman lodi oh united states
i have an emachine t  ghz celeron system that is a step up from the emachine t and the memory only reads at half the capacity
instead of the chip reading mb it only shows mb
i had used the pny configurator that indicated that i should use s but r geissman recommendation was too strong to pass up
well i must say a lesson learned
no hard feelings r geissman
im going to order the pny s and see will it do the trick
i hope this review helps someone who has an emachine of this modeli got this as a replacement to use in a very old custom pc which uses an agp graphics card and runs on an athlon cpu
i like the allinwonder cards because they have avin and avout connections builtin
this is very handy for transferring old vhs tapes to your pc or to a dvd
the card also has a tv tuner built in butit is analogonly and no longer usablei bought this card to start creating svcds super video discs  basically cds you can play in your dvd player of my favorite show
i didnt have any problems getting this card to work right out of the box but when i started watchingrecording  i found a lot of strange static on the channel i wanted to record
after replacing all the cables i was sure it must be the card as the same cable plugged into an actuall television had none of this static
i managed to return the card for a new one but had the same problem with the second cardi later purchased a leadtek winfast xp tuner card  and it has great sound and picture  but lacks the software features of the ati
so for anyone interested in recording and making svcds or vcds of their shows i offer the following comparison and procon listpicture quality and sound the leadtek was far better showing a crisp picture and with none of the sound problems of the atisoftware ati is the clear winner here
leadtek has no built in channel guide although you can use titantvcom  but it is much more time consuming than using atis built it guide
the ati software allows you to create much better recording schedules and you can modify most details of the recording
the ati software created great svcd compatible mpegs on the nonstatic channels but with that static they were useless
leadtek allows you to modify the recording options like bitrate etc in their software  but you can only select the resolution from a drop down list and the svcd compativle x is not there and  making any custom settings seems to throws the audiovideo out of sync by several secondsone thing to note however is that this card comes with an older version of the software
if you want the new stuff youll have to pay  to get it from the ati online storeprosgreat softwareim sure some people will have better luck with the whole static issueconsjust ok graphics chiphave to pay for software updateless than perfect tuner cardend result i started using the freeware virtualdub to record from the leadtek card and then convert this to compliant mpegs
this works but it is incredible time consuming compared to the extremely simple ati setup
i wish anyone who buys this card more luck than i hadi spent a full day researching which tv capture card i was going to get and decided on the all in wonder radeon   im glad i didthe installation was smooth
although it took a while to figure out how to set up to get audio
i have  surround sound speakers and an amplifier
when viewing tv i finally did get sound but it wasnt capturing the audio when i recorded
just remember that the to plug the adapter into the line out connection to the sound card
make sure that the installation wizard reflects that it is capturing to line out alsothis card comes with everything
all the cables for svideo composite video and audio cables
but the best thing it comes with is the radio frequency remote control
this baby does everything your universal remote can do
and since its radio frequency and not infra red you can virtually use it anywhere in your housethe package includes an interactive tv guide that you can program to when and what you want to record crossword puzzles and video studio  which i have not used yeti have read other reviews on this product and most people will have difficulty with the installation
when i installed the card i went to aticom to update the drivers
when i did everything went to hell so i did a system restore to get me back before i installed
ill keep the drivers that came with the disk thank youthis allinwonder radeon  just blows my mind
i think its about the best  i ever spent
i recommend the allinwonder radeon  because it gives so much for so littleupdate    must reinstall every few months
software is buggyhi this memory stick gave me no problems so far but if i had to get picky there is a noticable delay when writing the pictures to the memory stick
i used this stick on a sony dsc p
after taking a picture the lcd screen would turn black for about  seconds and it is probably writing to the memory stick during that time
i did not have this problem with the included sony memory stick or the  sony brand memory stick i bought
reliable but if you find this delay annoying buy sonyi read the reviews on this card and bought it
on my nikon  it is noticeably slower than other cards
in particular the writing to card icon in the cameras monitor which i never saw with the other cards is always there after taking a picture with this cardim hoping that this is not a terrible thing since i dont often take many pictures one right after the other and the camera does have a memory buffer
but instinctively i wish i had sprung for the extra  and gotten a faster cardcard works but is very slow

still its on the low end pricewise for  mb cards and for many people the card will work just finedont waste your time
this is not worth it
there are many other chips that will more bang for your bucksi purchased this with my kodak dx camera which i love because the tech support staff at amazon assured me that it would work with multimedia card too
it does notso the good people at amazon customer support i love them promptly sent me a return ticket for it
pity though
i had called tech support just so that amazon could be spared the expense of just such an eventand guess what
it turns out that i dont even need a media reader at all because thats what the dxs docking station does beautifully for me anywayhowever i do agree that you should buy this if your digital camera lacks its own docking base because its a great time saverive had this unit for about  months
ive had very few problems with dvd skipping or anything like that
my vcr portion works fine
but recently ive been having a problem with this thing actually reading dvds
it stopped reading dvds a few weeks ago
however since i was still under the manufacturers  year warranty i called samsung and they gladly offered to replacefix my broken unit in less than  days upon them receiving my current one
according to ups im supposed to be getting it in tomorrowlets hope it worksi have the dvdv model which is basically the same unit and while it does exactly as advertised as with any combo type unit the remote control is confusing as hell
itll play dvdscds cdrws and dvdrs
it wont play dvdrsrws
it also plays discs with mps and some dvdrwsyour mileage may vary 
stick a blank tape in the vhs slot while a dvd is in the disc slot hit record on the vcr side and whalla
youve recorded however long of a logo screen that says samsung and nothing else
overall its a good dvd and vcr but all in ones are a painif you are truly interested in a quality portable dvd player i would shy away from this one
however that was not my intensions when i purchased this item
i wanted a relatively inexpensive less than   dvd player that i could hook up to any tv and watch prerecorded and recorded dvd movies when i was out of town and on the road
you can accomplish that with this player via a rf modulator and some av cable and coax cable
i did not want to spend    on a portable dvd playerthe good this unit is very portable small compact and lightweight
it is not very expensive and it has a fairly well know brand name attached to it koss
it has played every dvd and cd i used in it including the ones i recorded myself utilizing my computer or my stand alone home panasonic dvd recorder
it delivers a pretty good picture quality and the sound quality is not bad either
of course all this depends on the quality of the television set you have in home or in my case your hotel room ughnow for the bad after about  minutes to an hour of continuous playing time the picture and sound starts to freeze
afterwhich the unit discontinues to play any further
this is an inherient problem with all these units
just read all the other reviews below
the unit get too hot to properly load and play any dvd or cd
period
so you are warned
it does not run on batteries only ac
you have to hook up a lot of wires to make it go power cord rf modulator coax cable av wires etc it does not have its own screen andor its own internal speakers but then again what do you expect for the pricei knew about the overheating problem beforehand by just reading the reviews of others prior to purchasing it
but for   i figured how can you go wrong
my solution to this problem was to purchase a small  fan  at walmart place the dvd player on a small cup to allow the air to circulate around the top and bottom of the unit and direct the air towards the back of the unit
do not place the dvd player directly on a tabletop and definetly not on any soft item
too much heat is generated in the unit and the player cannot dissipate the heat quickly enough function properlyi also purchased the extended warranty for this unit since it only comes with a  day warranty period
for   you can get a full replacement warranty for up to a year
well worth it because this unit has a high probiblity of failing completely within a year if you plan on using it a lotall in all  stars is a fair rating for this product
it works to accomplish all my objective although i have to help it along a bit
and as i said earlier you cant beat the pricethis little gadget will be perfect if it can also be powered by batteries or auto charger so that it can be portable and use with car screens on the roadgood for background music maybe for a small gethering but if you want to rock the party
nothey work well outdoors and have not given any problems in the  years i have had themenougth for many minidv camecorder but not for good quality mpixel camecordersi received this item before the estimated arrival date
i havent used it yet since its a cleaning cassette and the camcorder i bought along with it is brand new
it will be some time before i use it and be able to give a proper rating
but i loved the transactionsince we have no installed the battery in the camera we are not able to give it a review at this timei like it bulky as it is
this isnt a shirt pocket player but its tolerable on your belt or in a coat pocket
the sound quality is very good and the headphones are excellent
the menu system and controls take some practice but are adequate once you get accustomed to themthe riot seems to be very well made and it has worked flawlessly for me for three weeks
it replaces a  gigabyte nomad jukebox
compared to the nomad the riot is more convenient to operate the jogwheel is nice and much quicker than nomads buttons has a better display bigger font than nomad and a mostly better file management system and both loads and turns off much more quickly a big plus
the included fm radio is a big improvement over the nomad which has no radio
the gb drive is a huge improvement over the gb on the nomad or the ipod though creative now offers a gb nomad with similar capacity
i like the case which has a belt clip and permits access to the controls and unlike other reviewers i am not especially bothered either by the riots size bigger than ipod but on a par with nomad and archos or by its use of usb  instead of much faster firewire
sound quality is as good as the nomad which is fine and the player may play just a little bit louder which is better
unlike the nomad this player doesnt record and lacks a separate line out jack for use with a home stereo though i think you can use the headphone jack as an output jack with the proper cablingtwo big gripes  the software on the player does not permit you to create a quotsingle usequot playlist of songs by various artists
if you want to turn the player on and listen to songs from multiple artists you need to create such a list you need to name and save it before you can play it and i find this a frustrating timewaster
my second and bigger gripe concerns the battery it is builtin and not user replaceable so you cant carry a spare battery as you can with the nomad
the fully charged battery powers only about  of the ten hours of use its supposed to provide which might not be enough for some users
finally the player comes with multiple warnings against  recharging the battery before it is fully drained or ii leaving the player plugged into the charger after it is fully charged
because the battery status display also is not very finely calibrated i feel that i need to pay way too much attention to battery charge status
this can add up to a big problem if i know that i will want to use the player for several hours on a given day
for that much use i need to start the day with a fully charged battery
to do that given rios warnings i must remember to leave the player on all evening the day before to make sure the battery is fully drained and ready to charge so that i can plug the unit in at bedtime then get up in the middle of the night to unplug the unit and guard against overchargingthe real jukebox software that you load on your pc for use with this player seems inferior to the musicmatch based software that ships with the nomad jukebox especially for organizing files and editing mp tags
i dont know whether you can effectively substitute either musicmatch or windows media player but its worth investigating
i know that you can not use windows explorer to move files back and forth from the riot to your pc as i believe you can with the archosso all in all im glad i bought the riot instead of the  gb nomad
but only a little bitfirst of all this product was hyped up too much
it was supposed to be small and state of the art with a large hardrive
the only truth to that statement is that it has a large hard drive
the surfing of this product is god aweful
for gb of music you would expect a much better system
a system like the nomad jukebox  is great
i bought this when it first came outthe size is akward
they say its dimensions are smaller than any other gb hd based mp player
there is some truth but the fact is is that it is fat
dang
the jukebox may be bigger but it is thinner and much more streamline and much easier to cary
also the dials seem flimsy and with one drop they feel like they could breakprosbig hdbig screeneq settingsaccessoriesconssizesound qualityokmake cheapbad song surfingbatteryusb is slow no firewirecan only transfer songs with given softwareoverall i do think that if you buy this dont expect to be satisfiedserously this item is not worth the price and is more like a beta edition than a final editioni bought the studio  before understanding the archos product lines
all their diskbased mp players look alike from a distance but there are some significant differences the recorder line has significant improvements in the lcd display  lines vs  this makes a huge difference file navigation and manipulation menu keys dedicated onoff buttons audio output quality usb  support recorder  only i believe
the recorder line can also record mps via builtin or external mic but even if you dont plan on recording much the playback advantages of the recorder line are definitely worth the extra money
firmware updates are available from archos website so be sure to upgrade your player after purchasing
i know this is more a review of the recorder and not the studio but its important to know that a better archos player is available gigabytes is probably more than you need to store all of your music so unless you have an incredibly huge collection the studio  is sufficient
this player has great options for playback and the file system works well
however there are quite a few bugs in the os even though i downloaded the most recent version
the supplied computer software is pretty lame i must say
i bought this player because i though i would put all of my music from cd onto mp but i find that i dont use it often
playing a cd always has better quality unless you encode at some huge bitrate
also the usb connection takes its time
one great feature is the audio out so you can attach it to a sound system
the rechargeable batteries are great
theres a line in as well but that is completely pointless since you cant record mps
i also thought people would be intrigued by the player but a lot of people i know confused it with a tape player when they first saw it
if you want to buy this because you dont want to lug around all your cds and if you dont mind slightly worse quality go ahead and buy itpros cds in your pocket  how cool is thateasy devicetopc interfaceopen source replacement operating system availableconsseems fragileoperating system bugspoor user interface on the device itselffeature set needs improvement needs bookmarking total disk shuffle restart current songbuy this mp player if you want big music storage capacity on a budget
if price is not an issue then you definitely want an apple ipod
i paid  for this after rebate
i now see third parties asking for over   at that price stay away  cds in your pocket  how cool is thatwhen it works it works
you can load about  minutes of music and play it on the go
for  thats a good deal
just dont ever look at a friends ipod
the ipod is about  the size it super reliable and the user interface is excellent
plus the ipod uses firewire which is much faster than usb  easy devicetopc interfaceinstall the driver and plug it in
it shows up as another drive letter
very nice open source replacement operating system availablefor those willing to tinker with such things seems fragilein the  week i have had this so far i have seen  hangups or boot glitches
ive been able to clear these and restore function by restarting the device but this indicates a certain fragility in the os or maybe the hardware operating system bugsa search of the net finds that past os versions have been bug ridden
the most recent appears to be better but i still found a bug in that you cannot delete all of the songs from a playlist all but  is ok just not all
this problem has a reasonable workaround in that you can do whatever you want to the playlist using a text editor when the device is hooked up to your pcpoor user interface on the device itselfits actually not bad for  lcd lines and  buttons
im sure this helps keep the price down
again if you want a stellar interface go ipod feature set needs improvement needs bookmarkingits annoying that when you turn it off and back on youre always back at the top and have to browse to find where you were previously at
also forget about audiobooks on this thing needs total disk shuffleshuffle only works within a given folder
one workaround is to create a huge playlist of all your songs and shuffle thatneeds restart current songpressing  brings you to the previous song
to restart the current song requires the more arcane on and  followed by heres the thing i may just be spoiled and am used to highend mp players but i really think this is only an average playerthe overall size of the unit is quite big
its like carrying a computer hard drive around in your pocket all day and then putting  about  or  inches of useless plastic over it
the overall shape and size of the archos is way too bulky for my preference
it looks more like a bomb to me and not an mp playersecondly i found the sound quality to be subpar compared to other players
i ripped an entire nirvana cd at the highest possible quality and found that my ipod and my iriver slimx still sounded better
why
i have a feeling that this is because the amplifier in the unit is a bit weaker than those found in the ipod for example
this is not a bad thing if you are a whimpy listener and only listen at medium volumes
i on the other hand have practically made it a goal to become deaf and this unit wont help me accomplish that feati found the archos easy to control in my testing of it however it was lacking in the quotquick and easyquot department
the controls are a bit awkward and hard to initiate unless you have the unit infront of you
if you just want to go to the next song on your list with the unit in your pocket only experienced listeners of this unit will be able succeed in that
i constantly had to pull the thing out of my pockets and look at what i was doing
the unit is just too bulky and too complicated to understand without using your sense of sightmy last complaint about this unit while not a big one for most people is the community
i am a linux user and when i did research on this mp player to see if i could get some rd party apps to get this thing directlinked to my linux system it was nogo
i really wish this player had a bigger community or else id have maybe kept this playerin the long run however this player is still average
for the price you get a nice package and you cant go wrong with that
the capacity of this unit is quite high for the price and thats a good thing
however i think that in this day and age it isnt worth the money you save to get a player of such a lower quality
that is just my opinion
i am sure many people would like to beg to differ but for a highend music goer like me i need something smaller and of higher quality
can this unit benefit
it sure can
just make sure that if you ever buy this that you are not expecting to cary this in your pocket for ontherun sort of things or for school
for that kind of a unit id go for an ipod or the new iriver device coming out soon
on the low end get the newest mpcd player from iriver the slimx  its a great cd player and has features not found on the ipod and other similar unitsi hope this review helped
overall this is an average mp player
the reason it gets this average score is for the price that you pay to get such a highstorage device
many features such as the size and sound quality need improving but you get what you pay fori got this device at a huge discount
there was a dollar rebate and i found it cheaper somewhere else so the store marked it down according to their price match policy
ironically after all that it was still a bit more then than it is currentlythe device has works perfectly when i connect it through the usb pci card i bought for it and i have almost gb of personal data files stored
that feature was one of the factors in buying it
i like the over all quality of the product but it lacks some essentials and other features are buggyplus good sound and power conservation control
 sturdy design so far no damage after three shortdistance drops
 easy interface with windows  ive hardly had to use the safely disconnect dialog just plugging and unplugging at will
 decent sound quality and controls though it could use a noise filter for known mp sound degradation does this exist on other players
 reasonable price records onthefly to mp via builtin mic or linein
nice feature though i havent used it muchminus manual misses some key points of device operation
five languages mediocre coverage
 some displaynavigation glitches
 high storage load can cause slowdown in loadup and button response
also causes inconsistent freezes and sound errors
defrag may potentially help this problem
 housing back seems kinda thin making me nervous that the whole drive could break out if dropped hard enough
 no further firmware development as told to me by archos support
 only supports mp  no wma or ogg and mppro is compatible but sounds nasty and causes even more errors
 not very useful for linux users
can read from the device but writing is dangerous and could lock up linux
of course this is true of most players
 file naming for onthefly recording is really difficult and cumbersome
 could use more display area
as large as the device is the screen could be bigger
hard to sift through the hundreds of albums ive stored even in a folder hierarchy when i can only see five at a timeanother reviewer mentioned a car adapter
which is fine if you have a tape deck but if you have a cd player and need to use an fm transmitter to play through the car stereo youre out of luck
this device isnt compatible with the ones ive foundthis drive does the job for me and until i can afford something higherend itll serve my purposes
but if you can afford it pay the higher price for a better player
ill be looking to sell mine once i can put together money for something else  ive had my device for about  months
i experience random and exceptionally annoying lockups
the system just freezes in the midst of an audio program  requiring that i power down and power on the device
i believe there are better quality devices name brands available and i would recommend purchasing one of them rather than this unit
long term i expect it to be unreliable based on the increasing lockups that i am experiencingthe documentation on this is awful but rather than repeat what others have said ill say that when it works without freezing i am really enjoying this unit
it took me about  hours of experimenting to figure out how to efficiently record onto the devicethe things i like able to use the device like another hard disk  easy to copy rename tracks right through explorer
huge capacity to carry lots of recordings
simple drag and drop organization of directoriesthe things that i dont care for manual  unusable
software that comes with the unit deserves its own manual  took me three hours to figure out you can adjust options so that you save the track number as part of the file name  avoiding the creation of playlists for audio recordingsoverall i recommend this if you are technically savvy  id avoid it if you dont like to get your hands dirty exploring the nuances of gadgetry
i also question the long term integrity of the uniti am surprised when people say that they have noticed significant improvement in picture quality and sound with this
my home audio video setup includes a  audiophile grade stereo system and a   inch  sony lcd projection tv
with all that money and low distortion equipment you can detect the smallest of the change quite easily
i am so sensitive to sound quality that twice my speakers were replaced due to sound distortion that i noticed distortion that the dealer failed to notice but the manufacturer did
i am a music guy clean music is what i care about
believe me hts  whatever  does not lead to a significant sound improvement
on the other hand it might bring your amp juice down
you know you have to crank up the volume knob a little more than what you would do without it
i played different cds with and without the so called clean power and i could not observe any significant change
your experience may differ from mine
my audio components come from nad who are known for their excellent noise free transformers in their amps players tuner etccoming to video  the hdtv snowflakes are still visible
specially in the scenes of running water
from my experience all i can tell you is the flakes are dependent on the transmission quality
in channels like inhd cinimax hbo you wouldnt get any flakes in the picture while channels like thirteen hd are full of it specially scenes with running water
so did the clean power make any difference 
yes it did given you dont change any color settings of your tv the clean power would dull the extra bright bleeding colorscolors intensity looks more naturalhey but thats some thing you can do with your color settings  right so why monster clean poweranswer is surge protection
thats all
home insurance doesnt offer surge protection monster does
not only that
good music  tv systems are brought with a lot of passion
i have spent close to  months deciding  my stereo systemanother  months perfecting it
it would be sad if i loose it  to a surge and thats the reason why i chose to keep this hts whatever clean power
oand hey dont fall for the gimmick they show you on the monster cable websitemy whole system sits next to an air conditionerin fact theoretically speaking my entire system shares the same power line as my air conditioner doesi did not notice any change even close to what monster cable guys claim o  your money your choice item was ok  was suppose to fit behind the tv
it was to big with the small profile tv mounts
i used a  foot cord and connected to my major surge protectorthe monster  with clean  powerthe power center works well allthough i have not had any electrical storms or faults to truly test it yet
the few areas that i would take issue with arethe outlets in my house are the rectangular designer kind with no screw in the middle
the av  uses a screw in the center to secure it to the wall outlet
i have not had issues with it falling out but could be a problem would not fit behind my main tv because of the tight space between the outlet on the wall and where the tv is hung as with all monster power products i have the recepticles are extremely hard to insert a plug into
i guess it is better then falling out but they need to find a happy medium between not falling out and forcing inseems ok but as i said it takes both plugs
i also do not like the fact that if a surge does occur the powercenter is killed and cannot be used again
would a simple circuit breaker really be out of the questionmy new polk audio subwoofer has a very low hum when plugged in and not in use
i bought the mp sw  with clean power stage to eliminate this hum without paying up for a larger surge protector which i didnt need
however the hum still exists
booooon the bright side the surge protector appears to be in functioning condition so hopefully it will protect my subbought this to clean the power to my subwoofer that was experiencing some interference due to an error made by the inwall installer
seems to work reasonably well but no evidence that the power curve is significantly cleaner
difficult to incorporate into a wall plug behind a couch because it sticks out quite a bit so had to improvise with a power stripthis is what monster says ac power by nature is everchanging appliances turning on and off in your home causes voltages to surge and spike and this is sometimes noticeable in the form of lights suddenly dimming
this causes a state of flux for the power running your delicate electronic devices lowering the performance of the audiovideo as well as causing damage to the components
other conditions such as power outages and lightning strikes only increase this fluctuation
proper connection to an advanced surge protector that offers integrated system protection can help minimize the risk of permanent surge damagenow come on guys a surge or spike is not going to cause your lights to dim if anything they will brighten
a sag will cause dimming
if this thing could prevent you from feeling the effects of a power sag it would be very good but it would also be an ups or a big mother sola transformerand its not
this is just a surge supressor like many others and certainly well worth having but it will help not at all with very annoying sags as monster impliesfirst product did not work out of the box
nothing
second unit worked but item loosely rattling around inside
third unit worked and no rattling that could potentially cause a short
had for a few weeks and still working okheres a few excerpts from the glowing reviews herethe monster xphpci cable makes a big difference at any volume but it really shines when you are pushing allot of sound at once especially bass
the sound i am getting is a noticeable improvement over older monster cable of similar gauge
reproduces excellend sound probably the best speaker cable in this price range
this cable is great for anyone concerned with clear sound output but not with are large bill
the monster speaker wire delivers great sound and is very thick and sturdy
sure many people are happy using hardware store wire but if you like the extra quality this wire has itthe sound i am getting is a noticeable improvement over older monster cable of similar gauge
this cable is great for anyone concerned with clear sound outputid like to know how everyone was able to objectively ascertain that the quality improved from one speaker wire to anotherdid everyone have two totally identical parallel systems and have a completely neutral party with no vested interest listen to the differences between the two systems with the only difference being the speaker wires or did the person who purchased the monster wire change the speaker wires then  minutes later listen to the system and compare the sound to what they had remembered earlier and conclude that the monster wire must certainly sound betterwould you bet your life or  years income or dedicate your life to celibacy that you could positively identify which speaker wires you were listening toi happen to own all monster cables before hdmi and speaker wires
why
because i knew someone who in retail not a box store i could buy it from at true wholesale prices and it was insanely dirt cheap
could i tell the difference when i switched speaker wires
of course not
however when i upgraded to a very high end receiver and  highend massive tower speakers with a highend giant center speaker plus two rear speakers then i and my neighbors noticed a huge differencemonster products are faith based
you want to believe that they are better with absolutely no empirical evidence whatsoever because you need to reinforce your purchase decisioni know that those of you who already bought monster products are insecure and will mark this review as not helpful
i take comfort from thatfor those who havent yet bought the massively advertised monster products i encourage you to look around before making a purchase and realize that a speaker wire wont make your sound system instantly sound great or even better
no speaker wires regardless of cost or perceived quality will compensate for mediocre speakers or an old or inadequate receiverto further complicate the issue in order to truly judge the quality of the sound you need to have a source of high quality sound output
i primarily listen to recent bluray movies with uncompressed sound the difference is massive
go to bluray dot com to obtain the av ratings of movies
if youre listening to movies with poor quality sound no matter how good your equipment is all youre going hear is junkto give you an example how your own mind plays games with you heres my own recent experience  on my new bluray player i came across an audio option that was set for the default
i increased it to the max since my receiver is capable of handling the load
when i restarted the disk the audio sounded remarkably better
i was impressed by this new setting and greatly enjoyed listening to the new enhanced audio output that nightthe next day however i read the bluray manual and discovered that this audio option didnt work with hdmi which is what i have
i had totally deceived myself into believing that the sound had dramatically improved all because i wanted to believe this to be the caseimagine the influence advertising can have upon youthe sound quality seems to be decent i havent abd the cable against anything else so ymmv
it was relatively easy to thread through my walls the exterior insulation is tough but pliable and the string used to remove the exterior insulation worksmy only beef and the reason i knocked off a star is that it was well short of  feeti was in a bit of a hurry to get some cable locally and picked up a spool of this despite its expense
its not even oxygen free
anyway the clear casing may be kinda cool to look at but its difficult to work with both in cutting and when pulling
as far as audio quality i cant tell any difference between this and the lamp cord i had been using before
next time ill go with some solid core stuffmonster  very misleading again
this time they put  feet on the packaging and in fact you only get about  feetalso in true monster fashion they make the cable look thicker and of higher quality than it really is
it looks like really thick gauge wire like  or at least  gauge when in fact its only  gauge wire
dont use this for long runs  feet at best
lots of clear plastic insulation and a very thin wire were it really counts
people must be catching on to monster and their selling tactics and thats why this wire has been discontinuedmy subwoofer athena asp has the inputs for a yadapter to be used if wanted
i have always connected a single subwoofer cable to the subwoofer
the yadapter was priced really well and i was curious to see if it would make my subwoofer sound any better than it already did
i was not able to tell much of a difference in subwoofer sound with the yadapter connected
this may have had nothing to do with the cable but with the subwoofer
the cable itself seemed well constructed and good quality
maybe it will work better for some other peoples setups but did not for mesent me the wrong cable
apparently the one in picture no longer being made
they sent me something else
a complete false advertisement
never buy againfor smaller lighter weight satellites im guessing  lbs or less these are a really good deal
as other reviewers have said they come with a lot of hardware for different types of speakers including a keyhole adapter
however for heavier speakers that come close to the manufacturers stated limit  lbs these arent great
i just hung  infinity primus s with these
the s are  lbs and physically bulky
first you must get the allen screws at each of the pivot points very very tight without cracking the plastic
the tilting pivot for pointing the speakers down is next to impossible to get tight enough to hold a heavy speaker up
when you do get it tight enough the entire bracket flexes from the torque put on the joint by the weight of the speaker
instead of letting the pivot hold the weight i put spacers between the wall and the bottom of the speaker
this is for the wall mounting configuration
im pretty sure the ceiling mount would be completely unsafeunreliable for this reason
in my installation i will likely put a secondary strap on the speaker and the wall to ensure that the speaker doesnt come crashing down if the mount fails or if one of the joints comes loose
also for a heavy speaker mount these into studsthat being said im pretty sure these are perfect for small lightweight sats
my advice is to buy only one and try it out with your sats before you buy a setmy honest opinion its cheap and the quality is not as reliable or as good as sony
the sound quality through any of the earphones i tried i tried quality ones too which i subsequently tried on other portables did not produce a strong sound even at the highest sound setting
the hinge under the top lid looks like it would break very easily as it shifted side to side
the sound comming through the line out was superb i must say but i dont want to carry around my speakers
stick with the more reliable and consistent sony they just keep ticking this one is fragile and weekgreat product and i am still kicking this around but not using it as much as i used to
i used this for several years and worked like a charm upgrades are easy
best feature is that it plays all formats
bad feature is that its limited storage i used this player for a week and returned it back because of too short betterys life
i charged them  to full  level and they died in couple of hours
the display was blinking about an hour before switching the power off after rechargingthe sound was good though theres nothing to say aboutremote is too small and a little confusing to operatei think this player is not ready for mass production or maybe its just a defective itemwhoever is going to buy this player please be aware of the issues described abovei read the glowing reviews here and decided to upgrade from my cdonly player
i didnt like the fact that it makes alot of noise when preloading the cd and it does take about  seconds and even longer for a cdrw to do so
it is just as flat as my normal cd player but it is much wider too
another reason why i dont give this a star rating is that the equalizer is pretty   forget about any dsp surround sound you get with just listening to mps on your pc with a sound blaster sound card
not even the simple dsp settings i got with my cd player like live and extra bass
everything just sounds like fm radio
but i guess you dont need that when youre outdoors with all the noise anyhow
it is extremely convenient to have  songs on one cd and the playlist ability but you sacrifice a little quality for alot of convenience
still very good buy for the pricei loved this player when i first picked it up
but it doesnt seem to stand the test of timei drive truck so i wanted something that could hold a lot of data at least  hours worth so a flash player wouldnt cut it unless at an unacceptable kbps
i decided to pick up this player based on its reviews and  min buffer
i figured just start it playing before i start up the truckno good
well at least not for long
it started to freeze after a couple of monthsexamplemary had a litt pause  sec lamb whose pause  secskip white asim only guessing thats a buffer issue but either way its unacceptable
player plays fine otherwise but has done this once while not movingprogreat features on easy to use remotelooks sharpplays all bit rate mps i put in there  and vbr and wmafantastic battery life with supplemental battery pack includedcondoesnt keep its place with very long files audio books and bookmarking is a pain in the tucasbuffer fails with vibration of truck maybe not an issue in a regular vehiclewould not consider this for biking or running if thats what you are looking for it is a given you need a flash playeras to be expected the included earbuds are sub par
i use the sony earbud headphones mdrexlp
i can wear those for about four hours a day and not get sore earsill get one thing out of the way
i bought this camera mainly because it looked cool
i was shopping for a digital camera in an electronics market i live in asia and was looking for something in the  megapixel range
i ran across the coolpix  and the design of it definitely caught my eye
i looked at it for a while toyed around and decided i wanted to buy it
while its definitely a good camera its not the beston the whole i thought this camera was pretty good
one thing that sets the nikon coolpix line of cameras apart from everything else is its swivel lens design
this is clever because when youre not using it it covers the lens
no need to worry about broken lens covers or scratched lenses anymore
plus it helps getting angled shots much easier
no more craning your neck to get a shot above of below you just tilt the lens
its a whole lot more useful than youd thinkthe picture quality of this in general is pretty good
the colors come out accurately and the pictures are clear
however the night exposure could be better although its good enough to pass without any qualms
a big problem thats related to night time shots however is red eye
its always there and it never seems to go away
i managed to minimize it using the different scene settings but it just never completely leaves
it gets sort of annoying after a while but its something most people can live withalso the camera tends to feel on the fragile side
whenever i put it in my pocket i always feel like its going to break any second
of course its never happened and i realize that itll take quite a bit to knock it out of commission but it does have that light easily breakable feeling that i can never seem to shrug offsome other minor complaints is that there is no video output straight to a tv and there is no optical viewfinder although the optical viewfinder part isnt really too big of a problem
also there is no protection for the lcd screen
something along the lines of what sony does with their cameras would have been a good protective measure to take with the screenwith all these negative aspects to it you would think that i wouldnt like it but that isnt the case
it still is a good camera and its a blast to use
the visual quality is still fairly good and has a bunch of nifty features to it namely the swivel lens
and besides whenever you pull it out in front of other people and you swing the lens everyone will go ooohhhhhhlike most nikon digitals this camera offers excellent image quality
a good zoom excellent macro mode and pretty good ease of use
however i think the design is awfulfor starters the swiveling lens
due to the design people have a tendency to put their fingers all over the lens while swiveling it
also tilt it up too far and youll be taking a picture of the plastic housing of the cameraoops
perhaps the biggest design flaw in this camera is lack of a viewfinder
i guess depending on your situation it may not matter however if you live where i live bright sunny florida and you take pictures outside that lcd screen is virtually useless
it gets washed out youre not going to be able to see what youre doing and youll wish you had bought a camera that has an optical viewfinder
i dont understand how nikon could have omitted that from a camerathe only real advantage this camera has over competing manufacturers cameras is the macro mode
nikon is tough to beat in that respect
that aside look at a canon elph if youre looking for a small camera
the image quality is just as good you still get a zoom and you get an optical viewfinderoverall this is a good product to help keep the glove box tidy
it seems a bit too narrow though
it wont hold standard envelopesfirst of all these are well made and mostly well designed with places for pens and mesh panels so you can see where the insurance card and registration are located
my only problem is that theyre designed to hold a lot more than i intend to keep in them so the velcro hooks on the strap dont match the loop material on the case unless you keep the case very loose
if the hook half ran further down the strap it could be closed more securelynevertheless i may order more for familyi use this in my car on the passenger side visor but i had to put it on the top of the visor so that i have to flip the visor down to access the cds
i did this because when i put it on the bottomso i didnt have to flip the visor downthe cds would come shooting out of the sleeves of the cd case
not the cds inside it is a double cd visor holder but the ones on the outside were shooting out of the case at me whenever i made a turn
i guess the cd slots are too roomy or maybe it is the fabric or something
once i put it on the top of the visor the flying cds stopped
it gets the job donedoesnt fit well on my visor and the straps seem to get stretched out enough to make it fall down regularlyit was nothing special but was just as advertised
id spend a little more next time and get a better onethe cover is rather bulky for visor mounting
i found it annoying being so low below the visor
it is a good case that use for storing the cd in the side door pocket nowthe velcro design on this cd visor is pretty hard to use and i would not recommend opening it while driving
it completely obstructs the road view and is pretty dangerous
however even with all these complaints it does hold cds and fits around  cdsi have been following olympuss cameras since the d and d came out and had been waiting for them to release one with a certain feature set
i wanted  megapixels usb and a reasonable price
the d has that and unlike its predecessor the d it is pretty compact and runs on only two aa batteries not finally receiving my tax refund i decided to break down and buy a digital camera
there were really three contenders in my mind  the fuji finepix z the olympus d and the canon digital ixus   a friend of mine highly recommended the canon model but its list price was money which was out of my price range also nobody had it in stock
so for me it came down to the fuji and the olympus
i ended up going with the olympus because a local electronics retailer had it for moneythe camera itself is pretty simple to use
it has four quality settings x sq x sq x low hq and x high shq
while some olympus models ive used previously allow saving as a tiff with the d all of the pictures are saved to the camera as jpegs
this is a shame because it means you are stuck with the cameras jpeg quality level
if they had allowed you to save as tiff you could easily set your own jpeg compression level in photoshopthat is part of the problem i have with this camera and part of the reason i only gave it  stars
the picture quality is not that great
the camera seems to have an extremely difficult time focusing in lowlight situations even when the flash is used and the pictures come out very blurry
i played around with some of the settings but i cant seem to fix this
and even in bright sunlight i find images taken with the camera not to be very sharp at all
also some colors seem to bleed i took a picture of some flowers in direct sunlight and the picture came out as some pink and red blobs losing all the detail of the flower
i tried adjusting the white balance but it didnt seem to helpthe camera does take some nice pictures too however
pictures of people come out very nice and since i mostly take pictures of people at family gatherings etc and not scenery its an ok camera for my needsthe usb connection is extremely handy and in my opinion the best way to access a digital cameras files
my girlfriends brother has a smartmedia floppy adapter and that is extremely slow
with the d i simply plugged the usb into my computer and my pc running windows  recognized the camera as another hard drive
i then simply copied the files over
the camera comes with some software for editing pictures and stuff but i havent bothered to install it
i dont believe that windows  will allow you to simply plug in the camera and have it recognized as another hard drive you probably have to install extra driversbattery life is ok i have rechargable nimh aas so its not something i worry about too much
the fact that it only takes  instead of  effectively doubles battery life over most cameras in my mind at leastthe included  mb smart media card can hold  pictures at sq  at sq my preferred size  at hq and  at shqall in all its a decent camera for the price but dont expect perfectionaccording to our sales man this camera was rated by consumer reports as the number  camera under   two weeks after purchasing it i failed to see why
the limited  megapixels do make a difference especially when printing regardless of sizefeatures i liked nightime flash was wonderful
looked like photos were taken during the day
very lightweight although almost seemed flimsy
superior lens quality
picture size even high quality photos were not huge in bytes on the computerfeatures i did not like cannot view photos or even last photo taken without shutting camera
prolonged time from taking of one photo to next i am talking  seconds
a lot when you see a photo you like
often closed the front panel when grabbing camera from someone to take a photo in turn shutting it off
red eye feature everyone always blinked after itin the end i exchanged it for the d which was much worse stay away
and finally got the sony cybershotsthe olympus d is a very reliable if you want to snap a picture of the family
i have been using this camera for about two years and it has just been awesome even though it lacks a few things which i will get into in just a bit
i mainly photograph dirtbikers bmx and race trucks
this little camera does the trick in capturing fast moving objects
also it does very well with not getting messed up with all the dirt and dust in the air when photographing motorsports  i have never had a problem with this at all
it has very decent resolution as well but definitely not enough if youre past the novice stage of photography
i am very pleased with this camera considering it is an older model but there were a few downsides to this camera which has caused me to seek a newer model
the most annoying problem that i have every time that i use this camera is that the battery compartment on the bottom of the camera is one of those sliding latches
it always slides out causing all four batteries to spill onto the floor
so you have to be really careful when taking pictures to stay away from the battery compartment
also the batteries dont last very long especially if you use the lcd and review your pictures often
a brand new set of batteries lasted me about an hour to maybe an hour and a half or so with the camera on the whole time snapping about    pictures
another issue is when zooming in the quality of the picture becomes very degraded  spotty and blurry
and sometimes the flash is too strong when indoors it makes for too much contrast and loss of color in pictures
and when using no flash or the night time flash it comes out too dark or sometimes blurry  if your hand shakes or moves
so this is why i say that this camera is awesome if you just take general pictures but not if you are pursuing high quality shotsi really wanted to like the new zaurus
when i finally got it from amazon i must say that i was trully dissapointed
my wife has the hp jornada  and i have a palm m so ill compare the the sharp to bothpros hidden keyboard mostly nice software with a lot of applications builtincons screen   it is very unevenly lit actually has a bad dark spot in the upper right corner
mine also has a dead pixel
the screen isnt very bright and definitely lacks contrast
the palm is darker but has better contrast
i can use both the hp  and m at work without the backlight under the office lights
the sharp becomes very dark
i basically have to run it at  backlight all the time whereas the hp is on at 
also the sharp screen seems a bit muddy battery power or lack of it
the hp lasts over twice as long on one charge with using  backlight
the sharp seems to be actually worse than the old ipaqs it is pretty heavy and feels a bit odd in a hand
like a small brick
the hp has a much nicer feel the casing has a cheap finish to it the software is still not very polished with many very small buttons that are hard to hit and cluttered
on a scale of    as far as interfaces go the sharp is a  hp is a  and palm is a   it would be wonderfull if you could  combine all into oneall in all a nice first try but im shipping mine backi was a sharp wizard user so i was excited when they came out with a more sophisticated pda
i was swayed by the price and the pull out keyboard unit
since i purchased it in november  i have not been able to sync anything but the address book and calendar
this is a waste to me
after several emails and phone calls to sharp i am considering chalking this up to a bad experience and jumping out of the sharp bandwagon and purchasing a palm or ipaq
i am truly disappointed with this product and pray that you do not make the same mistakei own a z and i think sharp has done a good jobthe kernel is quite stable just as one would expect from a linux systemonce you can get the vnc service to runwhich is very easy you can do everything on the unit thru the pc
the two expansion slot is good and comes handy if you want to access the files on sd while your cf network card is plugged ineverything is cool except that there are issues with wifi support with some wireless cards
the support people are quite clueless and the only support they offer is send in the unit and well look at it which kindda stinksthe news groups are filled with peoples concern on this matter and there seems to be no resolution from sharpbut again if you are not looking to use a wire less nw card i think you could go for it
there is plenty of stuff you can download and insall from various siteshandango zauruszone etci loved everything about this mouse from the time i opened the box except for the fact that the buttons are rather stiff and my clicks often didnt register
im returning it regretfully because i like the fact that the two extra buttons can be programmed and the general size and shape is goodid recommend it for people with medium to large hands though
its just a bit big for someone with small hands
its definitely not for people who have arthritis or other problems with stiff buttons
most people would get used to them after a while i thinki prefer kensington products for my macs but this mouse causes me some pauseit works well but not as slick as all my many other kensington products
the softwareseems to be the biggest issue so far
its old software that comes with this mousego to the kensington downloads to get the updated software then the mouse is finethis mouse works better than the standard mouse that comes with a macwill i buy kensington again
sure i will
their service and warranty make all thedifference to mei got this mouse for an imac core  duo because reading all the information and reviews told me this is the mouse for me
however this mouse is not what i was expecting
so allow me to comment on any ides you might get from other reviews and the software descriptioni thought it would be quiet
the main mouse buttons and scroll button are mediummediumquiet which isnt very bad but i wanted quiet
but the side option buttions are loudi thought it would be pretty comfortable for my mediumsmall hands
it isnt bad but it is kind of tall at the center the hump is in the middle and a little widethe software was no good
it installed fine on my mac os x  but it wouldnt open the preferences it installed in the system preferences
it said i needed to update the software which was especially funny since midinstall it asked me if i wanted to download and install a newer version which turned out to download  and i did
i had to go to their website and download  which worked
however i did not like the configuration of the buttons and there was no option to make the side buttons do exposeacute
it also put an ugly icon of a mouse inside a gear at the top of the menubar next to the time which let you know if the singledirection scroll wheel was set to go updown or rightleft
guess what
clicking the scroll wheel changes this back and forth which means no more opening and closing tabs in my web browser with that button
i decided to uninstall the software and now it acts more like a regular mighty mouse excluding the sideways scrollinga minor or not so minor
thing is that the mouse cord has lead and it says wash hands after handling
wash my hands every time i touch the mouse wire
why dont they just use regular rubber or somethinganother minor thing scrolling the middle wheel a little so it doesnt actually scroll a notch makes a sound like the wheel is loosefinally the optical sensor which gives the mouse its location doesnt work on all surfaces it should
i work on a white table that has a kind of matte reflection and for some reason i cannot find the mouse doesnt work properly over the part of the table i usually use i have to use a mouse pad
a funny thing is that a logitech mouse i have which doesnt work on a raw wood desk in the same way this one doesnt work on my white table does work on the white table and this kensington mouse does work on the wood table
the apple might mouse works on both surfaces
so in summary it is a decent mouse but it has many areas that need improvement in order for me to consider it a mouse i would recommend or buy againupdate after less than two years the cord on this mouse has become unreliable
at certain angles the connection breaks and i have to jiggle it around before the mouse resumes working
im stuck back with the bluetooth apple might mouse
my new rating would be two stars for a twoyear lifespanupdate the scroll wheel finally gave out and became a loose mess
i couldnt scroll worth a darn
i tried fixxing it by bending the scroll wheel reader in towards the scroll wheel axle but that didnt do a darn thing
it gave me a little bit of solid scrolling for a little while but it went right back to its old problembut thats just me
others might have a different experience than me and kensington might have fixed it by now the mouse color scheme looks different than the one i have but its the same one
i eventually got a logitech mx  lots betterold review i got this as a replacement for my kensington mouseinabox optical pro which started having problems with the buttons not responding
also the kmiabop had inaccurate tracking
it moved pixel by pixel horizontally but moved by every two pixels vertically
not good if youre a graphic artistthe good thing about this optical elite which apparently is a redesign of the kmiabop is that it fixes all those problems of the kmiabop yet it adds one problem which isnt really a problem if you can put up with it
the scroll wheel is clicky when you scroll it from different possitions
what i mean is behind every normal bump of the revolving scroll wheel is a noticable sharp loose click
like the scroll wheel is loose or something and its not set in its axle right
i recommend it if this isnt a problem on other optical elites
this is definitely designed a lot better than the kmiabop
it has a neat light up scroll wheel area
it lights up a nice piercing blue though my light is a little off center
looks cool at night
also the light doesnt turn on and off everytime you move the thing
the buttons are located nice and high too
i used to accidently press the side buttons when i picked up the kmiabop
and the faux rubber grip is nice too it doesnt really feel like rubber when you rub your fingernail over the grip
it also has a better nametoo small for canon g or canon s or s
nice bag but too small in the since it is not deep enoughi had to return the bag because i had the worst time opening it
otherwise its nice looking and seems practical inside
why ruin it with that awful closureit doesnt say so in the item description but even if your laptop accepts pc ram this module will not work with processors slower than ghz
you have to get their pc ram if you have such a processor
be sure to check  to make sure this module will work
i learned the hard waynice design and layout but its too big for the pda user
youre better off with a steel business card holder or plastic pelican cases that are water tight and shock resistant alas they dont have those nice cubby holesi bought this antenna for the bedroom because of its db power more than anything else
i already had a philipsmagnavox antenna for the living room which i believe is less powerful but it actually performs less well than the philipsthe switch on back is unlabeled
i dont understand why someone would make a switch with no label
i know its on when the power light is on but there are  on modes cable and air
the way it seems to work is the middle is on air
if its off that means signals can pass through according to the manual
you can move practically every part of the antenna around but i have to do it far too much for my tastethis price is the same as what i pad at target
its ok but i bet a cheaper one would perform as welli had another rca with no powered amplification and that one was as good as this one
i was hoping that the amplifier would give better quality and might receive more channels but no
so this one as good as any other cheaper rca model atleast my antb and not worth extra priceinexpensive indoor antenna that works ok overall
surprisingly hooked it up to an hdtv randomly and am able to get about  crystal clear channels  in hd  in digital
sure beats paying over month for hdtv cable if you dont watch much tv
hd reception will depend on location building set up etc
of coursei got this back in  and its still working for me but im currently looking for a better alternative of ota digital tv
the unit is still holding up and still works
this unit requires to be plugged into work even in the bypass option but works okay it just requires a lot of patience and tinkering to get the max channels
with the amplifier on and the manual tinkering with the amplifier it takes quite a bit of time to get the max out of this little guythe rabbit ears have gotten a little lose from the constant repositioning but thats just normal wearandtear
the coaxial cable is short it requires and extension femalefemale adapter and some wall fittings for the coaxial extensionsthis product is very sensitive to nearby electronic devices and movementpositioning of any sort
the power cable is also very short so make sure you have an extension cord or a nearby outletim able to get the following channels  of  channels according to anntennaweborg    weak signal     ws     ws  when i bought my new flat screen tvvcrdvd combo i thought i would upgrade my antenna as well
i have to admit that i now receive two more channels and some of the others come in clearer now
the only thing i dont like is that every single time you go to a particular channel you have to fool with this antenna to get a clear picture
my old antenna once you set it for a particular channel that channel always came in clear and maybe the others a little shadowy but it was always great for that channel
this one is not that wayif you set it say for cbs to come in clear and you surf the other channels during a commercial break when you come back to cbs you have to twittle with the antenna again to get it to come in clear even though you never touched it when surfing through the other channels
the non powered rabbit ears with the halo works just as wellthe positive is that amazons price was a lot less expensive than the competitionswell my first basslink lasted  years
so why did i get another
simple its such a simple installation and provides just the right amount of performance in my truck and extended cab with the unit under the seat
ill like get the original fixed and keep it as spare since these units are not noted for their reliabilitygiven the above if you want good sound and easy install and are limited on space this is a good unit not great reliability but goodit produces a large amount of bass which for some is a great thing
however for me i wasnt looking for a big bassy sound
i want to just round out the sound with some extra bass
this thing gets real boomy and kinda bellows
i have this thing turned way down so it doesnt over power the music
if you want a lot of bass then this is for you
however if you are a musician like myself and just want a well balanced full sound from top to bottom this system might be a bit too much
cant beat it for the price thoughaccording to all reviews my wife shouldnt of bought this although it was a great gesture
not enough bang for the buck i am also a victim of the dreaded dead after warranty problemwhile the basslink was working it was perfect
it filled out the lows in the music on my car stereo with rich clean bass
i couldnt have been happier
but about  year into ownership the basslink would start randomly cutting out for seconds at a time then would come back on and work normally for weeks before repeating
the problem then increased in frequency until it finally cut out for good right after the warranty period expired
the power light still comes on and the wiring is still securely connected but no sound
i looked around and it seems like im not the only one
check out all the negative reviews on the crutchfield site
the positive reviews are probably from people who have had it in their car for a month or two and are dazzled by its performance as i wasi loved the way this thing sounded when it was working
it was amazing that such good clear bass could come from such a small package
its a real shame that they keep having these problems  id buy another one if it werent for this but at the current price its just too much to be considered disposable after a year or twofor the great sound it produced while it was working i give it  stars
for its reliability i subtract two leaving  stars overalli got this for  and thats why i dont regret buying it
too be honest i still dont know much about how to use it partly because im too lazy to tinker with something that to me should just be a glorified walkman but partly because the stupid thing came with basically no manualaside from that i use this thing  days a week at the gym and in the car with a tape deck adapter and i cant complain
occasionally it locks up on me when i load a new playlist or something so i have to pull the batteries or hit the reset button need a paperclip for that
apparently you can only have  playlists and mine seem to change at random sometimes appending each other and sometimes overwriting  but i am lazy when it comes to this thing i admit thatthe interface software works fine with wink and is about as dummyproof as possible although i must complain that the nomad doesnt recognize a lot of my music probably due to missing tags so it files the songs under unknown
my filenames are very hierarchical and descriptive i dont care about tags but i cant get this behavior to changethis is a good generalpurpose tripod for sony handicams
the remote control handle is a musthave feature for decent videos
with practice slow zooms are possiblemy biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head
it can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkinesshowever the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price make this a good buyits a clever design but i wouldnt put it in my pocket
i have a pocket monopod that also works as a steadicam
its called a readysteady and it really does fit in your pocketthis is just another way for sony to make another  on the purchase of their video camera
imagine my surprise finding out that i had to purchase a separate cable in order to create dvds from my dv camera
as far as the cable itself goes it is fine
but it sure would give sony more favorable talk on my part if they just included the cable when i buy the camerai did extensive research on this model the whole zr series and i must say a lot of things are positive for this little camera
 light weight  small  bright outdoor pictures  priceand some negative points raised by many so far which of course i have not been able to test as i have not bought this item is the motor noise being recorded and the night shots being grainyi will not discuss anything about it as they have been beaten to death by nowwhat i want to talk about is the smaller ccd resolution on the zr series camcordersas we know the us spec zr series have the k pixels out of which only k pixels are used for video effective pixels
we need about k effective pixels to get a  line video resolution on the tv
most of us know that the vhs format video tapes allow upto lines of horizontal resolution
the svhs tapes allow upto  lines and the digital video format goes to  lines really crisp and sharp pictures on the tvvisual mediaso now with mere k effective pixels of video resolution being recorded on the zr the best lines of resolution would be around  now not everything is bad
if you intend to transfer your videos into vhs tapes for storage and future viewing you will not have any complaints as vhs tapes store at  lines of resolution
but someone like me who wants to store the video digitally by burning them into dvds or storing them in dv tapes i would like to get the best resolution that i can rightin simple words i want  lines of resolution for my video full stop
even though zr is a dv camera its resolution is very poor for real digital quality videoby the way the resolution has got everything to do with what we call sharp crisp and colorful pictures
it is the same difference you see between the movies played from the vhs tape and movies played from the dvdoh by the way if your tv doesnt have a  line horizontal resolution capability you are not getting the moneys worth by renting dvds
the tv i bought about  yrs ago a proscan  inch has  lines of horizontal resolution
so i can assume most tvs in our houses have capable enough tvs
going slightly off topic do you know why the picture quality of hdtvs are so sharp
bcoz their resolutions are almost double than the  lines i am talking aboutthis light works just fine i guess but not the greatest ive ever owned
i broke rather easily when the camera was dropped so thats why it only gets  starsi own a canon x is binocular which i love
my wife wanted a lighter binocular so i ordered the x is
i am dissappointed in the image stabilization in the x
i get a more stable image in the x despite the greater magnification
the x stabilization leaves a noticable shake in the image and for about the first second of activation the image drifts slowly as the system warms up
i tried replacing the battery and even returned the first set but the second binocs have the same behavior
if i had never seen the larger binoculars i would probably be satisfied barely with the x but after experiencing the immediate response and rocksteady image of the x the x stabilization was a definite let down
otherwise the optics are greati recently bought two new pairs of binoculars from amazon   pentax papilio  x  and  canon  x  is
i have a separate review on the papilio which i rate at  stars
i give a few comparisons in this review on the canon because both units share a common limitation that requires design workarounds
pentax got it right canon didnt
note that the papilio has no image stabilization and is relatively inexpensive first the good news about the canon
the image stabilizer works great
i have a tremor which makes it difficult for me to use binoculars at x and up
one push of the on button and the image locks in place
there is no noticeable delay for initial lockin and no noticeable delay when changing view
thats what you get for the extra  over the papilio
image stabilizer performance is solidas other reviewers have noted two negs for the image stabilizer
 it uses a cr  lithium battery instead of more common and lower cost aa batteries which are used in the more expensive canon is models
 the onoff button is momentary on
press and hold down to operate the image stabilizer
i bought these for a concert
holding it down with a single finger for more than  min gets tiring
i needed to lock one finger on top of another for extended viewing gets annoying in the course of an hour
a bit tricky getting the fingers positioned right to hold the button down while focussing
a full onoff switch would be great for extended viewing
on the plus side the button is slightly recessed
it wont accidently turn on if you lay the unit down on a table with the button on the bottomin all other respects optically and mechanically the papilio is superiori
opticalthe pentax has good optical quality edgetoedge
flat field no noticeable vignetting or color fringes
edges of lenses smoothly ground
internal surfaces of lens barrel properly dulled no stray reflectionsthe canon is disappointing
flat field no noticeable color fringes but noticeable vignetting around the edges of the field
the internal surfaces of the lens barrel are shiny
stray reflections are noticeable mainly when viewing against the sky
edges of lenses have minute chips mainly noticeable when viewing against the sky
in optics in this price range i would the expect the edges of the lenses to be smoothly ground and blackened and internal surfaces of the lens barrel to be properly dulledii
mechanicala  shapepentax has a comfortable ergonomic shape
rubber coating gives the right amount of grip no goopy or tacky feel like some other rubber coatings
canon is poorly shaped and uncomfortable to hold
hard plastic body and smooth surface leads to a slippery grip when held with sweaty hands
b interpupillary adjustmentin most binocular designs there are separate right and left barrels joined together with a center hinge like a door hinge
each barrel houses an objective lens and an eyepiece
interpupillary adjustment distance between left and right eyes is performed by flexing the two barrels about the center hingein both the pentax and the canon the objective lenses are held in a fixed housing to accommodate their special features close focus for the pentax and image stabilization for the canon
consequently there is no center hinge
the eyepieces pivot about the fixed housing
you need to pivot both eyepieces in unison
in the pentax the eyepieces are ergonomically shaped and the pivots are smooth with just the right amount of friction to hold the final position
in contrast the eyepieces in the canon are awkwardly shaped and the pivots are stiff you need to wrestle them into position
c focusboth units have a center focus
the focus knob on the pentax turns much smoother than the one on the canon
d eyecupsthe pentax has helically mounted eyecups
you adjust the height by twisting them
there are click stops three positions
the canon has the elcheapo rolluprolldown rubber eyecups
e lens coversneither the pentax nor the canon have covers for the objective lenses
the pentax has a two eyepiece covers held together by a plastic strap
there is a plastic loop so you can tie them to the neckstrap
the canon has individual eyepiece covers no loops easy to lose
you need to unroll the eyecups to put on the eyepiece covers
so if you normally wear glasses and use the eyecups in the rolled down position you need to unroll them to put on the eyepiece coverssummary  canon has a great image stabilizer
to maintain a low price point they compromised on the optical and mechanical design
the pentax however shows that given the limitation of a fixed objective lens housing proper optical and mechanical design is feasible at a low price point
if  canon could combine the pentax design with its image stabilizer at a price point of   they would have a  hitnote that the touted list price of  is well above that listed on the canon website just under of the four hand held receivers ive used the sportrak map was the first one that i used extensively and i was very pleased with it for over a year until it quit working for no apparent reason
i sent an email message to magellan support explaining the problem and received a reply saying that it sounds like youll need to send in the unit for repair
no address or instructions were given as to where or how i was to send it
i sent two additional email messages requesting further instructions but i never received a reply
i then phoned support twice and was put on hold for such a long time that i gave up
other than an inelegantly designed external cable connector and terrible customer support the sportrak map would have been a very good receiver for the price
oh except that it failed to function after about a yeari love the ergonomic keyboards have been using them for years
but this replacement for my older one forced me to rebuild the old keyboard
this is smaller kyes closer together and out of the box keys stuck a bit
i cleaned that up with a pocket knife plastic scrapings but still its difficult to jump from board to board like i do and always have to adjust to different sizes
i suspect the smaller board makes more money for microsoft but its not making more for me 
i make a living using my keyboard
im taking much better care of my older boards nowmy wife really loves this keyboard and didnt have any problem adjusting to it
however i have used a normal keyboard all my life including every day at work and i found this keyboard really frustrating and could never really get used to iti too find microsofts rearrangment of the insdel set of keys as well as the arrow keys unfathomable
hmm maybe the geniuses at sony designed this one
  in any case this is a comfortable keyboard and affordable and i would continue using mine despite the stupid key placements
the multimedia version if a little better at least with the inverted t keys
btw the pro version is discontinuedthe mouse is rather lousy and chews through batteries really fast
the mouse is so bad i ended up buying a different wireless pointing devicethis is a great keyboard but has one major flaw
the letterssymbols on the keys wear off quickly
it is available in unfashionable white too and the white keys do not have this problem
it does take a while to get used to a natural keyboard but once you do it is so much better than the usual stuff
one downside is it will make it difficult for you to use a standard keyboard when you are away from your own computeri had a belkin wave keyboard before this microsoft elite one so perhaps this wouldnt have been a problem if i didnt know that a better alternative exists
the microsoft natural keyboard elite is easy to type on  the keys feel light and you dont need to use too much pressure
the main problem i have and something i wish i realized before i purchased the keyboard is the placement of the  number key
on the belkin wave keyboard the  is placed so that you can reach it with your right hand just as you would on a standard keyboard
on the microsoft elite keyboard the  is placed on the lefthand side
it basically means that i have to reprogram my typing so that i go for the  with my left hand even though ive been typing a  for the majority of my life with the right hand
every time i try to type a  on the microsoft keyboard i grumble inside because i always try with the index finger of the right hand first
if i had known about this key placement issue before buying the keyboard i wouldnt have bought this modeli keep buying this keyboard as its so comfortable and easy to typebut the cheap ink they use on the keys slowly erodes awaythis is the third keyboard like this i have purchase and they all loose ink on the commonly used keys of e d and ci even see gouges from my finger nails in the e key
must be soft plastic they usegreat for typing but you had better be good at touch typing because after a year of moderate use you will have no labels on common keysthe microsoft natural line of keyboards are the best keyboards on the market in my opinionthat said there are a couple things about this keyboard that for me take it from a star rating to a starthe wristrest is plastic and short
the plastic part is more offensive than the short length in this case
it feels awful and cheap but its not a deal breakerthe arrowdirectional keys are not in the standard position or like they are on other microsoft natural keyboards which is odd
this is done to make it a diminished footprint i think
in any case i dont like itthe key mapping is somewhat different from other microsoft natural keyboards but it isnt a big deali dig the designaesthetic of the black model a lot in how it looks on my black glass deski use this as my backup keyboard and as a keyboard for a second machine
for normal every day use as a primary keyboard i use and recommend themicrosoft natural ergonomic keyboard if there are typos in this message it is ecause some of the keys on this very keyoard are dead now
however i have been used to using a natural keyboard gee the b and the x are back and this one aleit dead again wired is the only game in town
others are either ugly or not curved enoughyet after only two years of regular use it stops working properly
if there is another option to my liking id definitely try others firstafter the numerous positive reviews on both  and various camera sites i went ahead and picked up a s
ive managed to get some good pictures with it but it definitely is not a good camera for someone looking for a point and shoot device
careful composing of each shot is required as is tinkering with the various settings and modesfor example on my first outing i took it to a large aquarium in chattanooga
when i returned i realized that only  out of the  shots i took was excellent  other ones were pretty decent and the rest were garbage
not great for a supposedly point and shoot cameraon my second trip i spent about an hour with the manual learning the intricacies of auto focus lock flash lock various metering modes and other features
if i spent a minute or so on each shot carefully determining the best mode for the situation my results were much better   out of  shots were excellentif you want a camera for a vacation where you want to snap something neat that you see as you pass by say out of a gondola while on a train etc  id say forget about the powershot s
if you are looking for a camera to produce excellent setup shots this may be the one youre looking forpros great picture quality and color  if youre willing tocompose the shot extensively rugged finelooking stainless steel comes with a liion battery pack  charger  good battery life menus are easy to navigate throughcons photos that are point and shoot are likely to come out blurry or improperly exposed to the point of unusability camera does not take compact flash type ii cards  only type i no uncompressed file mode  if you do any cropping  editing on your picture expect it to get worse each time you resave it focusing is very picky in lowlight situations price is pretty high for a  megapixel camera lower resolution modes are practically useless only the best resolution setting gives quality picturesi purchased this without researching to thoroughly
seems moot to review a product thats been discontinued but here goes
works almost too well
picks up my tiny terriers wrestling outside door
also note requires  c batteries
who uses c batteries nowadays
and one volt batterythough it does have plug for convertor not included
if you install good batteries it will cost more for the batteries than the unit
 dollars for me to get it power
in fairness you get what you pay forive had two of these for over four years and they work well for where ive placed them
they are rather cheaply made
the battery contacts broke when removing a volt battery
im not sure how well it works in weather because while mine are outside and i live in a very humid area they are kept out of the rain
the only reason im considering getting another brand is simply to have a different chime to hear so i can differentiate which motion detector is tripped
when the batteries get low the unit will chime repeatedly until they are changed out
the loudest setting is really loud loud enough to be heard outside when people approach a porch or are near a window so that could be a deterrent itself
i have yet to notice anyone noticing the sensor where i have it mounted it would be easy for someone to remove it
unlike the picture my sensor has the driveway patrol name printed on iti bought this item twicethe first time fall now that was a great item
i used it as a cat doorbell
it worked great starsunfortunately i never protected the sensor from the elementsso two years later it finally dies
the sensor would beepchime all day for no reasonno problem
i will buy it again and be for carefulthe second unit was identical to the st but the packaging was updatedinstead of coming in a box it came in that hardtoopenhardplastic crap we all hateit also had a label on it as seen on tvperformance crapit would do the randomconstant chiming slash beepingvery annoying
i threw it out in  days starno longer recommendedi have had  of these units for years and both work ok i use them to monitor for people at the side door of my law office
having had  of them for years i offer these tips
first the outside motion sensor takes a  volt battery and you should use only lithium batteries in the outside unit as lithium batteries are not as temperature sensitive as regular batteries which perform poorly when cold
lithium batteries are more expensive up front but they last  to  times or more longer than a regular battery
with the inside receiver unit you can use whatever battery type you prefer or an acdc adapter
the inside unit needs  c size batteries
second some reviewers have complained that the unit goes off for no reason
we found that flying insects were setting off the unit by flying near it
my solution has been to spray flying insect killer around the unit every  weeks or so in the summer
that works for us
others might want to adjust or reduce the sensitivity of the motion detector by placing black electrical or other suitable tape over the sensor window
but rest assured that if an insect flies into or on the sensor it will set it off
that is probably true for any motion detector no matter what the price
to be sure there are better quality units on the market but not at this price
once we switched to a lithium  volt battery in the sensor unit and wiped out our flying insect problem about a year ago the units have worked perfectlythe motion sensor works like a charm but it needs to have some sort of dial for adjustable range and sensitivity
it could also use a silent mode where the receivers lights flash with no alarm sound for when im working right next to it and can see the yard through the windowthis product works fine and it does what it is suppose to do but i would have liked to have had the ability to set the sensitivity on it because of it being to sensitive
the alarm would go off all the time for no apparent reason or because of the wind blowing something in front of it
i would end up having a lot of false alarms and so i stopped using ityeah the product is fine until i told my neighbor to buy one also
i didnt realize the driveway patrol had only one frequency
so every time my neighbor sensor is trip my reciever would go on too wahhhhhh
if your buying this item dont tell your neighborprice isnt baddidnt like the color because i use this at nightand the white color sticks out like a sore thumbi ended up putting black tape allover it for concealmentworks most of the time but fast moving vehicles will sometimesget by it without triggering the alarmunit worked well for a month then receiver died
even with external power supply i still cant get the receiver to workive had some things go missing form my car port so i bought this to try and catch the guys
setup was easy
but it seems it can be defeated by walking fast by it
if i walk slow enough it will sound the alarm
if i walk my normal pace it misses me every time
i would think a thief would be scuttling in the carport pretty fast to avoid being seen by a neighbor
so i dont think it will work for my proposes
maybe a car is big enough that it wont have any trouble
i gave it  stars the receiver should come with an ac adapter since it has the spot for one
try and find a  volt adapter with a barrel plug on it big enough
im stuck paying  for c cell batteries when they run downbought it on amazon
the pick up pattern of the outside sensor is weird
it misses the mail carrier on our mail box next to the front door but triggers on someone walking by on the sidewalk
also triggers on nobody at all a squirrel maybe
i tried pointing it down but does not help
my wife leaves it turned off so it does us no good
the design and feel looks real good
maybe if you can orient it exactly right or put white electrical tape over the lens to limit the sensitivity it could work but i have not been happy with it so farim not sure if its just overly sensitive or it just likes going off at random sometimes
i first set it up on the side of the house facing across the driveway
but every time our neighbor walked to his car it went off even  feet away through thick cedar bushes
so i moved it onto a tree facing the house at a  degree angle
everything seemed to set it off
so then i put it against the house further up the driveway where it couldnt pick up the neighbor
it seems to work good for awhile then for no particular reason it will start going off at am one or two times
its too high off the ground to pick up small animals in testing it there it only goes off for people or vehicles
very annoying we end up shutting it offit works well but its a little to sensitive everytime a truck goes past my house it constantly goes off the instructions say put tape along the side of it if that occured but it still didnt do any goodworked fine for about  months than just stopped working was using it so i would know when my mom was trying to get up so i could help heri bought this thing besides all the negative feedback
for  its much less than the  driveway alarms
the volume is a non issue  if its too loud put a piece of tape on it
the false alarms can be  eliminated and fix the real issuemoisture
put the sensor in a  cedar bird house  this keeps it from getting wet and keeps false alarms low
and it hides it from people that would take and disable it
small animals and windy days can increase the false alarms
okay for  plus  for the bird house from lowes and  cents in tape make a great buy
the range is not ft more like ft and only one doorive tried every position possible to make this thing work
if the wind blows the sensor picks up the limbs blowing on our neighbors yard and it sets the beeper off
ive changed positions from the front of the garage to the side of the house
my objective was to be forewarned when someone pulled in our drive
ive finally found just the right spot but not every time when there is movement does it work
you can walk right in front of it and it wont set off the beeper
be alerted that this beeper unit can also be plugged into the wallhowever that is not supplied and you have to purchase the ac adapter
its all plastic and you dont have a fortune in the thing so its not going to respond like an more expensive unitits good but not great for my usage
i own a bakery and wanted something to beep in the kitchen when a customer walks in
the beep is so annoyingly loud that it mobilizes everyone
i would like a way to shorten or lower itthe batteries died after  monthsbut then again its triggereing much more often than if it were used for a drivewaythe sensor is very goodno false alarms or peoples shadows triggering iti ordered  of the driveway patrol sensor receiver kits
 on  and  on   i liked the first one so i ordered a second one
i especially liked how loud the audio alarm was on them
in july the audio alarm stopped working on both of them
i have tried replacing all the batteries and putting the units next to each other and i can not get the audio to work on either onethe leds in both work fine it just the audio that does not workif i find a way to get the audio to work i will update my review
if the audio was still working i would give the units  starsthis monitor is really loud which makes you want to leave it off rather than monitor your yard
it works great other than the low setting is loud enough to wake the deadthe units worked initially well
yet within a period less than one month the receiver lost its voice
it seems that the alarm speaker was defective
i hope i can get a replacementit does sense approaching people and vehicles and animals most of the time but you must have the alarm very near to hear itcheapest you can get
takes c batteries weird at this point
extremely bulky for the small circuits inside
i cut mine up and rewired it but works good
for less than  it was worth iti like it but it is a little erratic
doesnt always go off
i have walked in front of it a bunch of times in a row to test it and sometimes it will not sense me and other times it will even though i pass by it exactly the same way each time
id say for the price it is a good purchase but dont leave a basket of expensive jewellery sitting out thinking this will prevent a robberywhistler is a respected vendor in the radar detector market
this is a model that won a few awards when it was first introduced in  the low price is because it is being closed out although you can still find it available online in the  dollar rangei dont think you can find a better detector for under  dollars so unless you are willing to spend  or more this is a good entrylevel model with the following features a digital compass highvisibility text loud audio alerts highway and dual city modes quiet and autoquiet modes all bandtm protection including vg which will conceal your detector from police battery saver that automatically shuts off your detector if you forgetbe aware that this model does not detect or offer protection against the most up to date pop technology but if you want it be prepared to spend  times moreso i have had this device for over six months now and its a great toy no questions
often used as a wma player with a sandisk sd card though i havent downloaded any games onto it yet will i ever
 and pockettv is nice to watch trailers oni havent had a pda before
nor do i use m outlook
so most of the synchronization is useless for me
its good to keep tasks and take notes including some data on pocket excelbut the battery life is bad and i have had repeated crashes and data loss lost some notes i took down at a conference  ugh
have had to load pockettv couple timesbut my biggest gripe is the sd card
i couldnt get the activesync to work properly and now it seems to run if i take the sandisk sd card out
why on earth would sandisk and toshiba make their sd cards incompatible with each other
can you imagine if a liteon or yamaha cdrw refused to work with a maxell or imation cdrrwi wonder if toshiba fixed this problem with their later devices
i just called techsupport and the guy very nicely said i had run out my day sw support and the sd card and activesync duh
came under sw
i am not paying  for the call
anyway it seems to work now so  atleast toshibas techsupport people are polite and nice even if toshiba doesnt offer much of it timewise
and their website seems to be bad as well oh wellmaybe i should have stuck with the cheaper palms but toys for boys and all that yknow avantgo is nice but then most of the stuff i could do on a cheaper palm
dont know about wma though  but now i have a separate mpcd player
convergence is still far awayas a pda the toshiba e is the best ive seen yet
however it like all pdas based on microsofts windows ce falls short on networkingive been hoping that microsoft and its partners would get networking right some day
the toshiba e looked like it might be the answer
with its builtin wifi wireless network adapter it appeared that the e at least would provide useful local area network connectivity
however like most wifi devices the es range is too short and the battery drain is too highoh well how about wide area networking with a wireless modem
i was able to find one wireless modem that would plug into the es compact flash slot
this modem its name escapes me adds  inches to the es almost  inches and costs an arm and two legs in monthly fees
with the modem in place the e takes on the form factor of a clamshell handheld windows ce pc
forget that
im trying to replace a blackberry wireless email deviceim now looking at handsprings treo   its got everything that the blackberry delivers including size plus its a wireless phone has a color screen and supports web browsing
wireless networking is part of your phone service and the cost for wireless phone and networking from sprint is about the same as im now paying for separate wireless phone and blackberry wireless emailfor the record im an it consultant and author specializing in electronic communications
the latest edition of my book mastering microsoft exchange  server sybex is available from amazoncomit is a good pda but for shure it is not the best onethe cons is the battery life is not the best one and if you dont charge it frecuently you can lose all your data it had happen to my just twice in the  moth that i had own it it is big you can not upgrade it to windows mobile  it has the worst soundpro the usbvga expansion pack is great the wifi integratedalso i lost the stylus pen so i bouth from toshiba the pack of  stylus pen for my soprise they where belkin pens in a toshiba case
and they are really bad because they scratch the screeni use screen protector and i have to change it every  weeks becouse the replacement stylus pen scrach itactivesynch seems faster on toshiba than another machinepocketstreets map program is  times slower on toshiba
turns out its because the toshiba is extremely slow at reading the cf card
i found out by copying the map from the cf card to the internal flash ramadobe pdf viewer is a bit slower on the toshiba
again likely because of poor cf card read speedi am noticing that the toshibas stylus seems to lose alignment after a while not sure whyi dont like the ejection button for the toshibas cf card
the only way to push it back in is with the pentoshiba does not have a photoresistor so doesnt know how to adjust screen brightness dynamically
you never know how much you miss a feature until its gonelack of backup battery on toshiba is not goodwireless works fine but i hear that the battery life is about  hour with wireless onthe graphics is reportedly faster with atis imageon chip  but no way to tell so fardefault mediaplayer does not play mps
have to install version  from the cd
then reboot they dont tell you about the reboot partno scientific calculator on the toshibaspeaker on toshiba is poorso far it seems the main reason for getting the toshiba is that it has built in wifi which frees up the cf slot and provides an additional securedigital slot for memoryfirst the pros of this productyou will not find as many features packed in any other pda today on the market
the fact that it has both type of memory slots the builtin wifi and the removable battery  yet  the thinness as the compaq would make this unit the best unit on the market
howeverthe cons battery life is extremely short
 hour if you are using the wifi   hours at the most for everything else the display really sucks especially when you compare it to the casio e
forget about using it in the sunlight too many lockups
 to  times a day i have to reset
toshiba is well aware of this problem
no service pack available today and no date for the release the buttons are too easy to touch and turn on the unit by you just blowing on it  so you take out your unit  and the battery is dead the record button is in the wrong place
it is easily turned on every time you take out the unit from the sleeve usb problems with synchingoverall  this is a beta unit with way too many problemsmy recommendation is to wait till toshiba has posted the service pack  then reevaluate
i personally am not happy with itthis thing was great when it was working
played all sort of formats for its day and was relatively compact
then after a year or so the damn thing started acting up with freezing and skipping and eventually it gave out
there are plenty of hacks for it but with prices so low for a new dvd player its not even worth your time to play with it
i didnt try to repair it instead it was replaced by a philips dvd player which could play divx mpg tooi misinterpreted the features for this unit
the specs for the ad said that it would only play pal dvds coded region   when i read the specs for the ad i read quotregion freequot to mean all regions
in other simpler words
i bought this unit to play dvds sent me by my german relatives and discovered that the unit did not do so
i have no idea where pal dvds with no region come from but it isnt germanyif you need to play dvds from europe this is not the unit to do it
im returning mine and having one imported from germanyit does however play ntsc dvds and all the other stuff specified at aol quite wellgood luckpeteri gave this  stars at first
it worked great and had a wonderful picture  at a great pricenow that we have had it a year it recognizes less than half the disks we give it otherwise showing the quotno discquot error
now that its below  it might be worth it if you think of it as a rentali got this player in nov  mostly to test and play vcd and svcds
i was pleasantly surprise that it was nicely build and easy to use
it played svcds mp jpegs 
 dvds but wheni tried to play a vcd no disc
after some research on the internet i found out that apex has dropped vcd as a supported format due to licensing issues
the only chance to get an apex vcd capable player is to get an quotold stockquot versionso i had to return it
what is apex thinkingid buy  if it did vcds but now i went and bought a phillipsht vertical dvd at target which does it all
for  times the price for what it does do  stars for dropping vcd supporta nobuy and knock it down a few starsas expected it works finewhat is unusual is that it always triggers a warning that it could be run at a higher speedleads me to believe its actually wired as a usb  device not a usb i would recommend that if you are considering this product you spend the extra  and get powered linksys usb port hub asin bzpi insteadwhat does not appear on amazons description but appears on the back of the packaging is a warning from linksys that this product may not work with usb devices that draw power through the connection unless you buy an optional ac adapter addon you see the usb socket provides both connectivity to other devices and a low current power supply to those devices that need it  like for example a mouse or a keyboardif you are attaching only devices that also plug into the wall  such as a printer or scanner  this may be a great cheap solution for you
but if you need to be able to add on other devices without worrying about whether they can draw power through this unpowered hub youd better step up and buy a powered hubi hope this helps you avoid the mistake i madei bought this hub because of the linksys name and didnt need a power input
agree it is kind of chunky looks pregnant enough to give birth to a usb cable jack
please note that if you need usb  this hub is not compatible
when i plugged in my fujitsu scanner i kept getting alerts saying i wasnt getting optimal speed tofrom the scanner so i just plugged in my mouse and keyboard into the linksys and plugged the fujitsu into a usb port on the pc and all was finetiny inexpensive basic usb hub
check however to make sure all your usb peripherals draw very little power otherwise you will need to buy the separate power supply as welli bought  of these bad boys but i had to return one
the one i returned had a big dent on the top of the case maybe i get the dickensons one see their review
i thought i could live with the dent but about  days later i no longer got video signals no matter what i did  neither switching discs and cables pressing the ip button nor swearing at it helped any bitthe nd one is still working fine knock on wood   days and counting and plays everything i throw at it
i would have given this player a full  stars based on value and supported formatsfeatures but my experience with the first kinda spoiled it for mea couple of side notes if youre using component video cables go to setup and change your video setting if the video has a redpink tint to it the burnt plastic smell and the buzzing from the disc tray is unfortunately a normal thingthe panasonic rql is inexpensive and compact and has a generous array of special features
these features include a handy odometer that provides a number that tracks the length of the tape as you record or play
another useful feature is a red colored light display that indicates the battery level
other features are a pausing button a button that activates voice activated recording a button that slows down recordingplayback and a switch that increases recording sensitivity
of course you will find the usual essential buttons record play fast forward fast reversethe quality of the recording is muddy and lacking in treble quality
however this can be remedied by pushing the button that increases the sensitivity of recording
this button has a marked effect on increasing the treble to a desired level
in fact i used epoxy cement to cause permanent activation of this button
since i wanted to make certain that the voice activating recording switch was left off and the slow recording button was also left off i used epoxy cement to permanently keep these buttons in the desired position
i wanted to avoid accidental activation of either of these buttons with the consequent ruining of my recordings
a problem with this panasonic recorder is that it causes crackling sounds to occur in the background of all of your recordings
if you really do not want crackling sounds on all your recordings you should seriously seek a digital voice recorder
it is possible that my particular panasonic recorder was a dud  or lemon   and is not representative of other new panosonic recorders
at any rate this recorder is superior to the sony vor clear voice tcmdv cassette recorder
this sony recorder is equal in size to the panasonic machine
however the sony recorder causes a horrible highpitched whining sound to occur throughout the entire recording
this highpitched whining sound found on the sony machine has been noted by other reviewers on the amazon sitetherefore i would recommend the panasonic recorder but only if the highsensitivity button is kept in the onposition for example with epoxy glue
if you fail to activate this button the recording will be muddy and lacking in treble qualitiesthe sound quality of the cassette recorders from both sony and panasonic might be useful for selfteaching where you need to learn things for your daytime job
but these particular recorders are terrible for recording things of a personal nature eg kids birthday parties or nature sounds
i would suggest instead buying the olympus ds digital recorderonce you use the olympus digital recorder you will never want to use a portable cassette recorder for recording
on the other hand if you need to do some listening perhaps of a recording relating to your daytime job or to some project of a technical nature a conventional cassette recorder is much more handy and has better sound quality because it has an actual builtin loudspeaker than the olympus ds digital recorder
also it is selfevident that the simple pushbutton control mechanism of the cassette recorder is much easier to use for example when driving or when using in limited light as in an airplane than the controls on any digital recorderi purchased this as an addition to my existing dvd player to play svcds i made from home videos
i picked this one because it was fairly cheap and some reviews said it would play svcds
the one i got didnt play them at all
it turns out that to play svcds in this machine you have to burn them with a special hack to make the machine think they are vcd lower quality
what a hassle
the medium rating is only because it didnt do svcds specifically
as a dvd player it worked fine and was good for the moneyi wish i could give this monitor a good review
however after  defective ones in a row i simply cannot recommend itmy first monitor kept losing the picture
after  or so minutes the screen would go blank
i would have to power the monitor down and back up to get the picture back
i thought this might be a fluke but this kept happening after  to  minutes
i plugged my old monitor back in to make sure it wasnt my video card  it worked perfectly
another hookup to the lcd and the picture went out again
the cables were secure
i took it backmy second monitor unfortunately had quite a few stuckon pixels
a stuckon pixel is where a pixel is always on while viewing the screen even when the video source does not have instruction to be on
for example a completely black screen had different pixels or dots that were always lit
it was like viewing the night sky with blue and green stars no red onesfor what i could see with the monitor itself the picture was very crisp and bright
it is much brighter than my  samsung v that i currently own on another pc
i tried several resolutions and only the native x had clear text
x and x both had blurry text
some dvd tests i ran on it were quite good and the response time was good enough to keep up
the monitor is very lightweight and takes up very little space
i honestly wish i could have received one without problemsi may still consider this monitor after getting over the bad quality of the first two
i would give quality  star and performance when working  stars averaging a star rating from me
i would highly recommend buying it from somewhere that had a good return and exchange policy
some etailers out there do not think dead or stuckon pixels are a problem until they run up beyond  or even  at one place
one bright stuckon pixel in the center  of the screen is unacceptable to me
the picture was excellent and this would be a good buy except for the defects so buy at your own riskwell after being a hardcore zenith fan for many many years i decided to go with this machine when my old zenith vcr ate a tape after  years and a few quirky ejectionsthis one seemed like a good choice the few problems i did have were caused by those annoying people putting thier grubby dirty fingers on the dvds at blockbuster that messed up the player reading them
after a quick rub on the dvd it worked finethe remote is a bit small for peopel with big fingers but not impossible to usemy biggest qualm with it
the buttons on the front are very hard to read and see which button you are pushing
this is due to the reflective backing the buttons are set through
if you have this unit set low and in a dark spot you can pretty much forget seeing what you are pushing best choice is to the use the remotei cant testify to the programing of this unit since ive trying to figure out how to get the best picture throgh a cable box comming from a new hdtv and all the other boxes and cables i havent had time to bother trying to record somethingif i had the chance to buy it again
i think i would pass and go for something a progressive scan capability
i would consider a zenith in that yes but this no
especially since i saw how going from the rca connection to the svideo improved the quality
maybe using the component output would kick it up to change my mind maybe notthe first one i received from amazon was defective
the clock would not increment thus i could not set the timer to record programs
after returning the first one and receiving a replacement it works flawlessly
the dvd picture quality is great and the quality of vcr recordings in ep mode is fine
only annoying part about the vcr playback is that the first  seconds are always a bit fuzzy along the bottom of the screen
the autotracking feature has always cleared it up thoughthese headphones sound very nice but they squeeze my head so tight they are almost immediately uncomfortable when i am wearing my glasses
they squeeze the arms of my glasses between my ears and my head and are very uncomfortable within minutes
i have to wear them only partially over my ears to avoid that problem and then the noise isolation is poor
they are reasonably comfortable when im wearing my contactsalso based on the thickness of the padding it looks as though they would have great sound isolation
however i was surprised at how much of the audio from the headphones is audible to others around me
i on the other hand dont have much trouble drowning out outside noise when wearing the headphonesjust got these and dont really care for them
they sound ok and i guess you get what you pay for
they sound a little boxy and heavy on the low end to me
certainly usable thoughnot a bad soundbased on the previous reviews i bought these and am pretty happy with them
i would warn anyone however that while they certainly reduce some ambient noise you would want to remove them to converse they are not in the class of noise cancelling
this became apparent on the plane where it was impossible to hear the full dynamic range of a classical symphony soft passages are lost over the roar of the jet engines
the headphone help but this is a real limitation
otherwise sound quality and comfort are decent and for the price youd have a hard time finding betterthis headset is really good except two things it does not cover you ear properly very discomforting if you use for long hours and secondly there is no volume control
these two features i believe are fundamental of a headset and should be taken care of even before i start talking about sound quality which is very good
please do not compare this product to sony or bose
bose and sony are much better but the price is also six times this oneover all i would suggest you not to buy this item
try philip or sony under i bought these headphones for my brother and after trying them out i went ahead and forced the headphones to cause less pressure on my head because they are very tight
i dont consider my head to be big and my brothers definitely isnt yet both he and i have experienced discomfort from these headphonesthat said they have better sound than more expensive headphones that i have even its bigger brother from sennheiser
stronger base yet clear treble these headphones sound great
just dont expect comfort and you wont be disappointedi didnt have extremely high expectations for these headphones
basically i wanted something to use at work for long periods of time
my current ones are old sonys and need some resoldering so i figured id pick up two pairs of these  the price is righti have an average sized head and these things squeeze my head very tightly
in addition the ear pads are too small to go around your ear so your ear lobe and the top of your ear are get sandwiched between the headphones and your melon
definitely not for use for long periods of time  fine for the first  minutes kind of still uncomfortabletried these out at fye
theyre comfortable and have clear sound but lack bass
not the best for rap dubstep etcim not as satisfied as a lot of the other reviewers are with the sound quality of these headphones
yes theyre extremely comfortable and soft and i appreciate the included inch adapter but theres tighter bass and brighter midrange coming through my little pair of skull candy for the same price
i also had to increase the volume about  to get the same loudnesswell its all in the tittle
i thought they sounded great but only lasted a year or soyou cant ask for much more these days
get use to this s because we are american and we dont vote with our dollar we vote with a fake ballotyou get what you pay for
i usually take good care of my electronic equipmentwith that being said i fear these headphones are not durable enough to withstand prolonged use
they sound nice and my ipod powers them enough for a pleasent sound
however they do smash your head and push on your ears
good enough for these sound great and block out quite a bit of external noise but they are quite uncomfortable for long periods of time
they make my ears sore
they need larger cups in my opinion and more space between the pad and the speaker so that my ears dont touch the insides
cups dont completely fit around the whold ear so my ears get sore a while from being squishedfor the price these phones are ok but let me tell you if you think theyre gonna be accurate at reproducing sound youll be disappointed
they are exceptionally bass heavy and that bass is muddy as can be
highs are rolled off and mids are lost in the sonic distortion caused by the overwhelming bass frequenciesi havent tried other phones in this price range these came with another product i bought but i wouldnt buy them if i needed to
id look elsewheregreat brand great price but headphones did not last thy broke after  months
i would buy again but no theseeverything youve probably heard about sennheiser sound quality is very much present in these hds which reproduces music faithfully in high quality and with a boatload of bass
i imagine this is about as good as it gets for headphones that retail for under  and i can say with absolute certainty that these sound a lot cleaner and more satisfying than the equivalent sonyunfortunately the oppressive tightness of the headband ruins it for me  these squeeze my head to the point that i end up thinking about the discomfort as much as the music
dealbreaker
a shame since this model seems so ergonomically sound otherwise with quality padding for the ears and under the headband and a superlong meter cordexcellent quality of sound but non comfortable for big headsi like to use headphones for travelcommute on lite rail or fly
these sound excellent usual senn quality but the pads are just a little too thin to lift the innards of the cup off the ear and the innards are hardso after  minutes ears are saying please reposition these headphones
after an hour hard to tolerate for any more until after a rest
the sound is robust i just wish the overtheear padding was tooi didnt realize when buying these headphones why they were billed as ideal for dj use im not a dj
the reason is that they have the worlds longest cableabout  feet i think
i ended up gathering up the excess cable and putting a rubber band around itvery clumsy
also bad the  cables from the headphones going down to the y get all tangled up no matter what i do
i get so frustrated with these headphones that i deliberately treat them rough hoping theyll break and ill have an excuse for getting a better pairtheir performance with music is fine no complaintsi got these for my friend last christmas and they served him very well for a while
he found them comfortable and the sound quality to be very good
i tried them briefly and felt the same way
but less than a year later they died on him
cant easily recommend these unreliable headphones
if you want to take the gamble they look and sound great for the price but they just might give out on you
this year i got him a pair of koss headphones to replace them because of their lifetime warranty
and no i have no idea if my friend called customer servicewell i just got these headphones
first test was with camels a nod and a wink
wow
they sound excellent rich tight bass not muddy or boomy smooth highs never shrill or distorted
crystal clear vocals
really exceptional sound for  and had i paid more i would still be happy regarding sonic quality
now the down side
i have a very small head and these still fit so snug that it hurts my ears
i cant imagine anyone with a medium to large head being able to wear them
unless my ears are just out of wack somehow
if the comfort level increases for meill come back and add a star
if they fit you well please dont crucify me this is just my own experiencei got these a couple years ago based on the very positive user reviews
i think i had come from a similar set of koss phones that i really liked but had become obsoletethe sound and build quality of these phones are great for the price
the sound cannot be called first rate but it is pretty full with good bass
the mids and highs are not balanced quite to my taste but again at this price you cant complain too muchmy only serious complaint is that after wearing these for about a half hour my ears get sore and i have to take them off
im not sure exactly what the problem is  it could be the size of the ear pads combined with a pretty tight fit or it could very well just be that my ears are an odd size
in any case it has become something of a deal breaker for long periods of listeningi dont want to dissuade anyone in light of all the glowing reviews here but i thought i should throw my two cents in
everyones ears are different
if you can find a seller with a good return policy you could give them a try and then return them if they dont fit righti have owned two of this headphones
the st one which was also purchased from amazon lost sound in one ear after using for two years or so without any noticeable sign of faultiness except no sound and i ordered another one from amazon because i liked this headphone for its sound quality and comfort
after  months the nd broke again much faster than the st one this time the line wears off and was broken at the connection to the earpiece
i think i am not going to order one more of this kind any moreits pretty decent for the price
the sound quality is great but to be honest im not an audiophile
i was mainly looking for a really comfortable headphone so i could keep it for a long time while at workunfortunately this didnt turn out to be the set
i can only keep these phones on for maybe half an hour then it starts bothering mei bought these for  my kid and they didnt last very longthey are cheaply made and not worth the moneyi dont have any complaints about the sound they sound good
only problem is that they become uncomfortable to wear after about a half hour
the ear cups are too small and the fit is tight so your ears start hurting as they are being mashed against your head
ive got a pretty average head and ears so unless you have little ears or not using these for more than min at a time id go for another pairthese were wonderful until one side stopped working
i tore it apart and resoldered the wires it worked well for a while but now acting up
my little brother now uses them and deals with it
i wish mine wouldnt have broke
ive contemplated getting anotherthe sennheiser hd  headphones are decent headphones
the sound is very good but not quite as good as the bose over the ear headphones
comfort is the main problem with these cans
again i found the bose to be more comfortable than the sennheiser
but for the price you cant beat it
if you have the money go bosei tested in immediately after its arrival played eagles hotel california the bass is of bad quality laud and boomy
this is not a high fidelity headphone as some reviewer claimed but is what you should expect for 
i guess it would be a nice set of headphone for childreni had these for about a year and i cant really comment on how great the sound is since i just use them
the right side just stopped working so i might get another pair of headphones soonthese earphones sound great but are so bulky that i never use them
based the product photo i knew when i ordered them that they would be bulky but i expected to be okay with that
i wanted to use these with my ipods for exercisewalking
the cord is very long and you can roll it up on the attached spindle but then you have the spindle to deal with
great sound quality and very comfortable but annoying to use compared to my bose earbuds
these would be perfect for someone who listens to an ipod while seated or for your kids to use in your car
they would be perfect if they were wirelessif you have a bigger head than average i suggest looking for a different set of headphones
i loved these for about  minutes and then started to get a headache do to the pressure on either side of my head
the sound is great thoughnot a bad set of cans for the price
dont expect miracles
fairly comfortable
would have liked a better cord wrapfirst the good these headphones sound wonderful
ive used them to watch tv and play games on the computer
sound quality is excellent no complaints
the chord is also pretty long around eight feet id guesslong enough to get from my tv to my bed
the overall construction is very high quality and they should last for a very long time
sennheiser is a great company and the quality of these headphones is excellentnow the bad like some others have mentioned they arent the most comfortable headphones after an extended period of time
here is why the headphones are big enough to cover your earsbut they are not deep at all
what happens is the hard inside of the headphone not the cushy padding surrounding it ends up pressing on your ears
this is fine at firstbut after about an hour it really starts to hurti can think of two situations that might make this better
if you have very small ears they might fit inside and not hit the hard inside
if you have very large ears the cushy padding might rest on your ears instead of around themkeeping the hard inside away from your ears
id consider my ears of normal size and my above ideas are probably wishful thinkingthe only solution ive found is to wear a beanie during use
this provides a nice padding between my ear and the hard inside
luckily its cold right now but during the summer this doesnt help much
 again they sound great but be wary of the comforti had higher expectations on these ones
not very good at noise cancelling does not have that intense bass i was looking fori guess they are good for what i payed i should have gotten the skullcandy with bass thingyprosgood cable lengthfor the price you pay you get veiled highs and mids with muddy lows
articulation is poor and the soundstage is narrow
overall id spend money on ear buds before these
passif you want a great value look at the jvc harx
very nice for the moneysounds great for the cost and at least appears to be durable
but despite being of average size in this department the earcups are too small
cant be worn for any period of time
also could use some kind of cordmanagement system cord is too long for use with shirtpocket mp playerthe ear pieces are very tight for me space wise
my ears are not abnormal in size but i have to put them over my ears carefully so that they wont hurt after awhile having some portions pinched by the ear pieces
they clamp pretty tight also
all else are greatsounds great but little uncomfortable to use little tight on earsthough my face is elliptical not to say for broadfacesyou can feel the ear getting lightly heated after half an hourive owned my hd s for about  months now and have logged about  hours of listening time
theyve broken in a bit and are slightly more bassheavy than they were initially
regardless id rate sound quality as about average
these are better than most sony et al
brands you can find at target for around the same price point
however there are a few much better options for slightly more
i had a set of grado srs that blew these things out of the water and were only marginally more expense
the hd s have a muddiness to the sound and lack clarity in vocals and guitar so they arent really ideal for rock music
rap sounds okay and the low end response is good
keep in mind these are closed ear headphones which can either be a good or bad thing
for one they isolate the sound a bit so if you use these in noisy environments theyll make your listening experience a bit more pleasant
on the other hand they make my and presumably others head feel warm after  minutes of listening
i would not want to wear these in a hot room in the summertimein terms of build quality they are very sturdy
ive run over the very long cord many times with my desk chair without any issue
i also toss the set around quite a bit and havent noticed any damage
the grados on the other hand would have probably exploded if exposed to the same abusei loved these sennheiser headphones
they were comfortable
the sound quality was great
the noise canceling during flight was excellent
unfortunately the left ear stopped working today after  months of moderate use
the only thing i didnt like was the cord
i ordered another set because i love the sound quality
i have my fingers crossedthese headphones perform wonderfully especially considering their low price
i have listened to rock pop country and classical music and these phones have sounded great in all genres
however after extended wear they began to cause me outer ear pain where my ear touched the interior part of the headphone
i have since switched my primary headphones to the sennheiser pxi bought both and did my own listening testsony mdrxd mdrxdthe sound is rich and immersive
mp files sound really good
it hides the mp artifacts for low quality files
voices sound very perfect and deep with great range
the letter s and the letter f are wet it does not sound like a whistle
i can listen to youtube videos
which are low quality
and still feel like they are high quality
basically the sony makes low quality files sound high quality and rich and very very rich which is amazing
it has a bigger more comfortable cup
the only drawback is that it doesnt block outside noise
overall the sony is more comfortable and i can wear it for longer periods and the loudness of the volume is very moderate and comfortable
for example
i could put the volume really high and still be able to listen to it without feeling annoyedsennheiser hd  hdthe sound is more live and near
not as immersive
you can clearly hear mp artifacts
in fact even high quality mp files sound pitched with squeekiness
voices sound too squeeky clear
the letter s and the letter f are heard in a high end pitch
like the letter s is more squeeky and not wet
it sounds like someone is blowing a whistle into your year which i dont like
the only benefit the hd  has is that it is a closed cup so outside noise is muffled out
it has a smaller cup compared to the sony
the sennheiser at loud volumes sounds annoyingi also got j earbuds and koss clipon sports earpads which i both didnt like
the sony mdrxd is better but they are both good for the price
i would use the sennheiser outside and the sony at indoorsfor less than  and with so many positive reviews i decided to pick these up to use while working at homemy initial impression was that these sounded great
i was hearing parts of songs id never noticed before
bass was good and every songmovie sounded fantastichowever after about  minutes of use my ears started to hurt
i have a pretty averaged sized head and averaged sized ears but these headphones really made my ears sore
my girlfriend found the same to be true as well although it took her longer to feel an discomfort
so i gave these a three whats the point of great sound if i cant stand to have these on my head
somewhat subjective i know but just something to keep in mindproshigh quality soundsturdy constructionlong chordconsgets uncomfortable wearing them for a long time
i have small ears and head
i tend to used them for long gaming sessionsbass is subparnot very portable due to lack of folding featuresso i was very happy with my purchase initially
for the money you cant beat the sound quality and comfort
so why only  stars
after regular use at the office  hours a day  days a week after approx  months of ownership i noticed the left ear started to cut in and out at random
i realized i could shake or maneuver the cord and the sound would come in clear without going outsadly as i write this the left ear cup has completely gone out and wont play anymore
i assume the wiring came looseso now im forced to toss theseive gone ahead and purchased my first pair of noise cancellation headphones the audio technica ancs
heres to hoping the build of those last longer than the  month lifespan of thesemany people give these headphones pretty good reviews which is why i bought them five months ago
initially i liked them
with time and use the luster has worn off
i continue to regard them as a fairly good value for the money but they are in no way good or excellent headphones
after three months i bought a pair of hds to replace them on my sound system
i continued to use them on my imac but am now planning to replace them altogether with hds on that systemat best these headphones are suitable only for occasional use as lightweight phones on a mobile device like an ipod
over the past five months i have come to these conclusions about the s comfort
while the s are more comfortable for me than ear buds for instance they cannot approach the comfort of a welldesigned set of phones like the s
the ear cushions are not as snug and seem illfitting and somewhat harder than i would like
the headband requires constant adjusting and the action is poor
extended use of the phones is not very comfortable
construction
these are flimsy plastic headphones
over time i have found that they tend to pull apart rather easily so i am constantly trying to piece them back together
simple things like the cord routing are poori am constantly stepping on the cord and snagging it
sound field
the s have a somewhat constrained sound field compared to the s which are much more expansive
response
although the frequency response looks good on paper in practice the sound from these phones is just not as rich with either the resonance or harmonics of better headphones
downmixing
for headphone use my receiver downmixes eight channels into two
this comes through as distorted sound on the s
the s in contrast have no difficulty with downmixingi was very pleased with the sound quality that these cheap cans were able to reproduce but unfortunately the headband is so tight on my head i have a large head that i will have to send them back
seriously they hurt after just a few minutes and they press directly on my ears
perhaps if they were circumaural ie
around the ears i might be able to tolerate it but the pads press directly on the ears and it hurts as well as warms up my ears
taking them backpros the sound quality is pretty good but nothing that will blow you away
but do give it some time to break in
im glad that the cord is very long mfeet so that i can watch movie from my big screen desktop hd monitor while lying on my bed
many of the headphones out there have short cablescons unfortunately the headphone is too uncomfortable to wear for longer duration ive an average ear size i guess
the ear cups put force on my ears and i have to constantly readjust it when i wear for more than mins
the cups could have been a little more spacious and cushioned for more comfort
on the flip side this looks compact compared to some other top headphones out thereother thoughts i tried very low frequency sound test high bass and the headphone started crackling
crackling stayed for some time even for general audio but sound became normal after a whilethese headphones should meet your expectations for sound quality from a  pair of headphones  i am surprised senheiser put their name on them because they are neither remarkable or an especially great valuehigh and mid range seem a bit flat but the bass is solidi returned these because they are simply too tight for my head
if your hat size is  or larger you may want to try something else
they were painful to wear after just  minutesthere are numerous reviews of the sound which is fine for phones in this price range
i wanted to comment on the comfort
i have a large head
i wear a   hat
these phones are not adjustable in any way  just a single piece of plastic although it is well padded
the problem is the pressure on the ears and the lack of padding on the earpieces
the padding is too squishy quite simply
do not buy these if you are a cabbage head like mei ignored tales of caution regarding this because of the remarks id heard regarding the sound on these cans and they are pretty good
i didnt spend time measuring how warm it is or anything because i found these incredible uncomfortable
the phones them selves can with not much effort be popped off of the main headband which itself is very tight on the headthey do have great sound from what i gathered in my months having them but these headphones feel cheaply made and aesthetically are not too pleasing
youre not going to want to wear these in publicim sure there are audiophiles who will love the hd headphones but these are not for me
the bass is overwhelming and tends to wash out the treble and midrange
i tried comparing this set to my year old sony mdrvs and the sennheisers were no match in terms of balance smoothness and comfortfor pros i have to admit the noise reduction capabilites are terrific
i cant hear anything from outside even with the sound turned fairly low
the cord length is generous and using this to watch movies never sounded better
supposedly you can remove the cups and the cords but that was never an area of my concernfor cons i have several considerable complaints
one these headphones are just not comfortable for me
the closed cup design is a tight squeeze on my ears and i cant listen to anything for more than an hour before i start feeling burdened by the pressure
the bass often overexaggerated on classicalpop and downright deafening on electronictrance starts to give me a headache before im done with one cd
the worst thing is how most music in my collection is not properly balanced
i have to do major tweaking with an equalizer before i can get vocals to comfortable levels
again midrange and treble suffered a tremendous distortion at the expense of booming lowsgranted this set was really an experiment for me this is the first time ive tried sennheiser and a closed cup design
unfortunately i cant say these headphones won me over in either category
im returning these to amazon and going back to looking for another sony to replace an already proven winneri have been very pleased with the sound quality of the hdpro headphones
the bass is as good as everyone says and the rest is quite clear sharp and balanced especially in this price range
the headset is comfortable to wear and i experienced minimal discomfort after  or more hours of usehowever after three years in my studio the foam around the ear cups and the foam pad that contacts the top of the head has decomposed
it has all melted and turned sticky and it comes off and sticks to skin hair glass wood metal etc
it is difficult to clean off
these headphones ended up costing me about year to use
i was hoping to get more use from them
i rate them stars for sound quality but only stars for quality of materialsvaluei was going to buy a  bose overtheear headset that can be tested at target and bestbuy but i decided to buy this one for about 
a little disappointed since the sound quality did not match the bose but in hindsight i should not have expected a  headset to sound as good as a  headset
the bass of the hd is outstanding but the highs and mid level sounded closer to my white intheear earphones that came with my ipod
the earphones are comfortable and i do enjoy the deep bass but overall i cant rave about it
for a  earphone i got my moneys worth
comparing it to my  sony earphone it does sound better because of the deep bass
my final recommendation is to audition the  bose earphone at target or bestbuy and decide if you can afford the extra 
now that i heard both i really wished i got the bosebought and returned because my husband didnt like it as much
not that its not a great product he just wasnt feeling it as well as he wanted to for recording says it was too bulky
but other than that it wasnt bad
but returning it was a breeze with no problemspositives  good clarity amble depth rugged designnegatives  still cant be compared to bose bass could have been more
very heavy and grip is uncomfortablethe hd headphones by sennheiser were the first pair of headphones i ever purchased that were considered good
after putting them on and trying them out on a few of my favorite sources computer games home stereo etc i was pretty impressed
sennheiser clearly knows how to make a good pair of phones that sound goodas is obvious from the pictures these are closed headphones designed to surround your ears block out ambient noise and allow you to really listen to the musicnot just hear it
i was most impressed by the highs and mids but found the phones lacking somewhat in bassthe lightweight plastic construction raises some questions
it seems as though sennheiser decided to make a lightweight pair of headphones for home use
however i found the construction quality lacking and eventually the headphones broke from normal wear and tear
also the phones started to only reproduce sound in one ear regardless of the source
i did not investigate further but i suspect the cord may have been shotall in all these are decent headphones for home use but i would not recommend them for music on the go
their questionable durability mine lasted less than two years leads me to believe that you should keep these at home in a safe place
if you do so you should be able to enjoy some decent soundthese are my first sennheiser headphones
i purchased them based upon the glowing reviews for their sound
i just also bought a pair of sony  headphones at about the same price range
the sonys blow these out of the water
the s have deeper bass better imaging extended treble and are more sensitive
they also seem to mate better with my yamaha receiver for impedance purposesthe sennheiser hds will give you better sound than less expensive headphones but both the sony  and vdj models are overall better in sound sensitivity power handling and distortioni bought these after reading a review of best headphones under 
they are ok but nothing special
bass is strong but not tight mids and highs could be better
in that rough price range ive since bought two headphones that are way better bose ae tight strong bass balanced by great soundstage mids and highs and grado sri which have unparalleled mids highs and an airy spacious soundstage and tight precise but less pronounced bass
the bose are sealed aroundtheear phones and the grados are openback
you would do well to consider the bose and grados superior sound at a reasonable pricei have had these for about  years now
the do sound fantastic
i will comment on items others have statedvery tight on small heads making uncomfortable after  mins or sotight fit is great for best sound  but also causes ears to get hotas a monitor headphone you dont get exaggerated bassi keep mine stored stretched over the top of a speaker in an attempt to stretch them out to lessen the fit pressure
amazingly they never fatiguedstretched and never cracked or brokewear them on a jet plane and you can barely hear the enginesin the end i rarely wear them due to discomforti needed closedear headphones for noise isolation working in a lab and also good sound
these model has both
the ambient noise was reduced significantly equipment noise people talking
the sound was very good noticeably better than my cheaper hd
other nice things are a coiled cord decent materials and designhowever these headphones are very uncomfortable because of the pressure on the head
plus i wear glasses so be aware that this may be a factor
i tried them in different positions for a couple of hours then finally gave up with a huge headache
will be returning unfortunatelyim a singer and guitar player and use these for feedback during recording sessions  very high quality sound at a very good priceafter about a month im still quite happy with the bang per buck factor these are professional quality at a reasonable price
my only complaint is the cord  they have a coiled cord like a heavy version of the old telephone cords and its only about  feet long unstretched which means you are very quickly to the point where you are tugging against the coils with the left earpiece where the cord connects
i wish they just had a simple long straight cord insteadthe headphones have nice audio quality are comfortable to wear but the isolation from room noise is only soso it seems that comfort and noise suppression are mutually exclusive
i do like the heavy single cord
but at  these headphones are not a great valuethese sound amazing but look kinda goofy when on your head
the cord is also super thick and super long coiled bungie style best sound quality ive ever personally heard from headphones but are really designed for sound board ppl or studio use
not every day walking to class type like i was hoping and looking fori am a headphones fan
i like to try as many as possible to find the perfect set
i believe i found the best overall with the brand ultrasone
however seeing how many positive reviews this set has i decided to give it a try and decide if my impressions for the ultrasone headphones were justifiedi kept the headphone for one week and made sure to give it as much as a burnin as i could by letting it play every night with a selection of various musical styles
i ended up with about  hours of burn inmy final ratings for these headphonespros very good sound overall nice buildcons bulkyi decided to return these headphones at the end
sennheise makes very good headphones but i find myself more satisfied for the range of price with the ultrasone hfg which are cheaper and deliver as good or even better sound and are x more confortablethe width between my wears is not more than average
but if you wear these for more than about an hour say playing a video game so that your spouse doesnt get upset with all of the booms and crashes your ears will ache
the sound is very good but you just cant wear them that longnot bad in price rangetook some getting use to because im accustomed to a brighter more detailed sound
but the warmth and creaminess makes for a pleasant listening experience
older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out
not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount
good upgrade for those coming out of cheap headsetsthis headphone has very good audio quality but after  minutes it is very uncomfortable to wear
i am starting to have headaches on the side of my head above the ears after that timei have had it for the past  months and now i dread wearing it
i am  with average sized head
try this before you get this
it does not stretch with timegreat sound but i didnt realize these grip the head so tightly when i ordered them online
or maybe i just have a big skulli bought a set after reading an audiophiles anecdotal review
however it became  apparent they are a couple of notches down on smooth frequency in the midrange and tapered down graphically off in the high frequencies
after reading headrooms empirical graphs  i discovered this was indeed the case 
most people buy headphones based on their bass response 
these have a smooth but slightly exaggerated bass
a real and exceptional deal is still the old sony mdr v or  based on real empirical evidence they are noticeably better and have reputation for endurance which trumps everything in a closed phone
they are slightly cheaper also
the  sennheiser hd are noticeably better too and have that wonderful spacious sound of open earphonesits a very nice headphone nice sound but i found it very heavy after using for about an hour of so i used to get head ache so stopped using it but i will still recommend it for its good quality and also for a short time usewell for closed headphones built for a really high noise attenuation these are fairly good
they obviously have next to no soundstage at all not much room inside there at all and the bass is terrible though
theres a modification known as the bluetak mod wherein you line the inside with bluetak putty which helps a good bit by absorbing some of the vibrations and reducing distortion
ive also taken it a bit further and even tried to add capacitors to each to act as a firstorder highpass filter reducing the bass a little bit
still the mids are very badly recessed and the highs are less than ideal all the same
it probably needs a second order filter at least
heavily equalization is necessary but i personally hate equalization it never sounds quite right plus you have to enabledisable it or even change it around every time you change headphonesspeakersetc which is really troublesome when you use the same player with multiple deviceslocations
still youre not going to find much better in closed headphones that are truly closed
most that do sound a lot better  for example the denon ahd or even the low end ahd  are semiopen designs with very little actual attenuation and a lot of sound leakage which is part of why they sound so much better whereas these have almost no sound leakage at all and attenuate outside noise by a lot
at this pricerange i seriously doubt you can find any that can match its attenuation that doesnt sound a lot worsegood sound but way to heavy
i cant handle the weight so i returned the headphones and got a pair of boseedit the guy at rat sound discovered many of the hds problems are caused by the flimsy cheap driver housing that vibrates and resonates except when something solid is placed against the housing
this headphones driver housing needs a redesign with either higher density or thicker plastic or with even better magnesium alloy
the driver in it is capable of good performanceoriginal reviewi compared them today back to back
ive heard the sony many times in the past even owned them for a brief time
senn had deeper bass but a dip in the upper bass and a touch wooly in one or two midrange spots
sony while it didnt go as deep lacked any significant dips or wooly aspects from the upper bass to the low treble
the sony was still potentially a touch too bright and when the material allowed that brightness to shine though those highs could get hard especially on dynamicallycompressed i dont mean mps recordings maybe even harsh
in the past i found them a lot more harsh but maybe my hearing isnt what it used to be
the senns treble though not quite as bright or at all hard was still a touch bright over neutral and could be a tiny tizzy or fizzy or something
not hard not harsh but lacking precision
neither headphones had amazing extension up top or sparkle but they were both about average in that respect
neither had fantastic microdynamics throughout and both headphones tended to flesh out different frequency regions of lowlevel detail more than the other
sony still seemed a little glassy in the midband but its flatness there more than made up for it
the senns had nice microdynamics in the lows but its upper bass suckout prevented it from fully exploiting that lack of distortion
this also contributed to a lack of apparent tightness
sony has the upper bass and while youd expect that taught quality to shine completely through its inferior microdynamics down there prevented it from fully exploiting it
still that sony upper and mid bass had fair separation when there were obvious layers and didnt blur them into mud even given this characteristic or its lack of the lowest octaves
the senn was a touch more open and spread out in imaging but lost some of the immediacy and engaging quality the sony grabs you with
i found neither great or fully flat  extended and both had their strengths and weaknesses
with the appropriate material or sources to match its strengths the sony was the easy winner but you had to be aware of its quirks and limitations
the senn was more tolerant of material  sources but never soars as high metaphorically speaking
the sony might range from a  to  in sonics while the senn hovers more safely in the  range if that makes sense
it did go very low was more forgiving of high frequencies and isolated better
the sony wins on durability though as there is a body of complaints on hinge or headband breaks with the senna little after the  year warranty went out my headphone started to develop small cracks near the head pad
i wish they addressed this flaw in the material of choice
plastic does not flex as good as metal
its too bad theres no competition in this price range
wouldnt mind paying extra for a metal support on the collapsible headsetbought the exact same model that i loved so much my old hds circa  were taped up and falling apart
then i hardly used these after buying the replacements because the new version of this model was so inferior
the sound is still good but the comfort level was greatly reduced
the previous version of hds had really soft earfoams and were enormously comfortable over hours of use
these feel tight and constricting
i dont know what they did but i would have paid more to keep the prior quality
im guessing the new material was a cost issue
ps
i still use these because the sound is goodi have big head
those are too tight
bass is not impressivei have to agree with many of the reviewers who have given these earphones low marks for comfort  the sound is great but it just doesnt make up for the fact that the ear pads are very hard and they really arent large enough to cover the ear
very uncomfortable to use for more than about  minutes or so
i am very disappointed especially after reading the many good reviews
these people must have really small really hard headslike many of the other reviewers i found the sound quality produced by these headphones to be top notch
if i were judging on that alone for the price these headphones would get  stars
i use them for gaming listening to music and watching movies occasionally
the bass is deep detailed and rich
the highs are well acentuated and not too sharp
and the mids are not muddled
they also seal out sound very well even at a moderate volume level its hard to hear my wife talking to me  feet awayhowever i find that the biggest deficiency is the comfort
the plastic body of the headphone is not adjustable widthwise and the tension they provide is just too much to bear for long term use especially since i wear glasses
bear in mind i dont think that i have a particularly big head   lbs but the tension is just way too high compared to previous models ive ownedmy only other complaint is that the wires go to each ear piece instead of having one wire and running it through the headband to the other ear pieceso in summary highly recommendedif you have a small head i bought these headphones on the basis of the great reviews and the price remanufactured at lt  us
after three days of burning in i turned the headphones on
hey where is the fullness
the sound was detailed but thin clear but lacking in soundstage also although i heard the vocals clearly there was a minute disruption in vocal continuity
the sound was also too slow
ok my basis are the grados sr which are bias towards fast exciting sound but are not the most open soundstage themselves
still i even found most of the music fatiguing  i wanted to say come onplease
pretty please make my music play
in any regards i turned on some classical and the music was tranquil nonfatiguing gentle detailed and very nice
i guess these are classical headphones
i was hoping for morei wanted to buy a good headphone for my iriver slimx  before buying sennheiser hd i read lot of reviews and finally decided to get this one because it seemed to have what i wanted great sound comfort wearing light weight and long cord
when it arrived i was surprised to see that it came in such an enexpensive plastic package compared to the price i paid and the quality seal was off the place where it should be
but i was still excited to try it on
the first impression i got is it was big and felt very tight on my head
then i was somewhat disappointed about the sound it delivers
it is not as good as i expected
it does deliver clearer layers of sound from different instruments but not that great
i tried lot of regular cds and mp
the conclusion the earbuds that came with my iriver slimx is not that bad at all in spite of lot of people saying soanother big problem i got is it is really tight
my head feels pressed and very uncomfortable
so after just two days with sennheiser hd im returning it
the  return shipping fee is the price i paid to try this product
i will look for something less expensive but more comfortablei dont quite like the cheesy look of the headphone silver color like a toy
but i have to agree i do like the sound of it
the highs are crisp the mids are warm i dont care too much about the bass
this headphone is good for classic and vocals but apparently not for trench and heavy metals
the sound is open and tansparent and relatively smoothbecause i have a massive head this headphone hurts my ears like hell
it is too tight for me
pulling both side down to the end helps a little but it is still somewhat uncomfortable for me
so be aware if you have a big head like i do think before you make the purchasei dont like the allplastic feel of the headphone and i think i already saw small cracks on the inner side of both part left and right of the bands when i received this from amazon its like this already
i dont know how long this one is going to last but i am afraid it might not be very longusually i place comfortablity after sound
but not this time
i do like the sound coming out of this headphone
but it is just too tight for me and i am not fond of the build quality of the headphone
i do like the build quality of all the other sennheisers i own thoughlet me start off by saying that this in general is a very good minidisc player
with that aside i would like to say that everything else is far from being simple to use
when you get ready to use this product youll notice that you will need to use their software in order to transfer the mps to your md playerit begins
the installation of openmg is one of the longest i have every seen
took me at least  mins to get it fully installed
now there are two separate programs openmg and simple burneropenmg is the program that is used to transfer the mps over to the md player
simple burner mearly rips and transfers the newly made mps to you md playersounds good right
wrongopenmg leaves traces of the song on your hd so basically its filling your hd up with duplicates of your song but in their format atrac
then they put a restriction on it which only allows  transfers of one song called checking out and after that you will have to delete the song by using this software called checking in in order to be allowed more transferssimple burner only allows you to rip the songs to lp or lp basically compresses it to fit more songs but there is no option to rip it in stereo i need this in order for it to work on my old md player which does not support lpthere are ways around it though you can download realone player gold and then add a device section to download a patch for net md support
it then becomes basically openmg but without leaving any copies in ya hd
it is easy to manage songs on your minidisc as wellwith that being said yes this player is the best for its price but be ready to be disappointed by its software that is used to transfer your songsa major shortcoming of this offering is that you cannot convert your existing mds into mp files
i wrongly assumed that since you could place mps onto mds that you could perform the reverse operation but you cannottherefore my existing mds cannot be converted to mps which is exceedingly frustratingif anyone knows of an offering where this is possible would you post it herei have about  minidiscs and while it lasted it was great but because of its condition it did not last very long and its now worthlessit never recorded very well i wish they were made more rugged but they are very fragilei only received the player but none of the accessories thank god i still had some from a previous model i had bought new when they first came outhopefully when i can afford it i can find a more rugged model that will do all thats expected of it
like i said though it was great till its demiseonly giving  stars because it  was suposed to have  sets of gold coaxual cables but only had one in packageother than that is is good and fast shippinggood for outdoor that is why i had to have another one to replace the retired from abuse its predecessor
it has a very simple nobrainer operation
good solid water splash protected housing
backlit but not bright to disclose you in a dark display
unfortunately support completely dropped by garmin no software for other than  bit windows pc having serial port and you will have to hunt the mapsource maps for it
you cannot connect it to usb
the only solution would be to keep an instance of windows  bit as a virtual appliance just  to  continue using this device
this pocket navigator will not replace a good gps enabled tablet with satellite imaging thermal doppler and topo overlays but it is sealed has a descent xaa battery cycle and i see the best use it for situations where there is no room for more toys where frs radio communication is required in a spotty cellphone grid  and environment would simply kill your tablet or cell
best for something like moving across country terrain or bushwhacking through a swamp
the radio part is good enough frs repeatergmrs but unfortunately garmins ptt or vox headset or laryngophone either not available or very poor qualitykinda flimsy but works well with a very small camera and attachment light mic etcwith respect to the positive aspects the main one is that the bracket has two hot shoes at its end at such an angle that it can comfortably hold two items particularly a light and external mic
also it is quite adjustable in terms of distance it can be set from angle and angle
the product is also well built
it is made of plastic but very durable and hard plastic so it is very difficult to break
despite all these attributes why does it only deserve  stars instead of  or 
primarily because the tripod mounting stud is too small
it barely fits due to its diminutive size into the tripod socket
due to its small size if you had it in the socket for a prolonged period of time and it was holding any item of more than the smallest of weights it would probably damage the tripod socket
this is particularly the case if your cameras socket was plastic as opposed to metal
how much would it have cost sima to have used a slightly larger stud
another penny or two
what a shame to degrade such a product for thatbut one thing i never see mentioned is that the display is extremely hard to see especially at night
the backlight even with battery at full power stinks
i am replacing my batteries weekly to maintain a backlight that is half way reasonable because i watch television primarily at nighti actually have a flashlight on my coffee table so i can see the displayother than this i agree with the other reviews
but if you cant see it how good is itthis is not easy to program but when i did get it programed it worked ok on most devices except those that use a single button for on and off and then it hung up a couple times and would do nothing until i removed the batteries for a few seconds and then reinstalled
returned for refund but would have gotten a replacement except for the one button on and off problem
when i would set one button macro to turn everything off my samsung dvd would turn on when it was off as it was one of the devices that use the same button on its remote to turn on and off
the learn feature worked great
i did talk to the tech line a couple time for set up information and they very helpful and knowledgeable about their remotei found the quality of the picture and sound to be very high and the combination of features first rate
however given the choice again i would not purchase this combination model
in two years i have had to have the set serviced twice because the dvd player suddenly went dead and my usage of dvds is less than once a monthmouse is ok but retractable mechanism broke after  monthsnoting that this is a low end headset the unit performs its function well
sound volume controls are sufficently well placed for good control and an ample lenght of cord for any setup
sound quality is rated very good
the headset adjustment could be a little easier to set but overall a good buy for the noviceworked as advertised
i havent used it much we just dont need this item any more so i gave it awayi wish i could give this player a great rating but in fact i have very little i can go on for the rating except that mine was defective straight out of the package
thus i cant go on about sound quality or other features
it felt sturdy
the controls seemed easy to operate
it just didnt play
the cd would cycle but that was the extent of its performance
i had no trouble getting through to sony on the phone always a plusand after a brief discussion they agreed that it was a malfunctioning unit
i have several sony items and this is the first time ive gotten a lemon
based on prior experience i wont hesitate to buy sony again but this time i am going to select a different walkman cd player the next quotgradequot upthe cable does what it claims it provides a  long link from the celestron nexstar hand controller to the rs port of your computer
that few if any laptops or desktops have an rs port doesnt seem to matter to celestron
you will need a serial port to usb adapter meaning more expense and complication
if you want a lot of expense celestron will be happy to sell you one
i gotthis oneanother comment
five feet is quite short for use in the field
some usb adapters add length but you may also want to budget for another extension cablefinally i control my mount with a linux powered netbook running debian linux and the program cartes du ciel
in addition i installed the package indibin
the usb device that pops up on the computer is usually devttyusb
you will need to ensure your user is in the dialout group
even then you may run into trouble writing to the usb device
the simplest workaround is to make devttyusb universally writable by issuing the following command as root or by prefacing the following command with sudochmod  devttyusbi honestly only purchased this for my guide scope i needed a diagonal to attach my auto guider to
i would not recommend this for visual use or imagingthere isnt really anything wrong with it but for visual use save your money and buy a better diagonali got this to use with a astronomy technology mm aperture  refractor for terrestrial viewing
the first i sent back as the hole for the tightening screw was too big so it could not be secured in place on my scope
the replacement is fine
there are better optics out there but this item is fine for the pricethis is a great adaptor however it is not in my opinion a complete adaptor
i purchased this thinking that i could use it with my nikon dslr camera and realized after an hour of setting up my telescope and getting it zeroed in this does not attach to the camera and you need an additional adaptor that fits into this one for your camera ring
these are specific to your camera so i understand that you cant sell a universal kit but it would have been nice to know that up frontdo not expect too much out of the product
the adapter works however its kind of flimsy
for the price however i kind complaint too muchworks fine for what it is proposed to do
however i wish it had a x lens to focus onto
not sure if it was me or the lack of lens but only way i could avoid see the guts of my telescope was to use a barlowi guess the designer of this product wanted for some reason to allow eyepieces to be used inside it
or perhaps a barlow lens
but the result is an adapter that is longer than it needs to be and that moves the camera about an inch farther than necessary from the image plane of the telescopes primary optic
this makes the adapter unusable with most newtonian reflectors built for visual use because the filmsensor plane of the camera cant be brought close enough to the objective to bring an image into focus
even on a refractor of catadioptric telescope the length of the adapter needlessly increases torque around the point where the focusing tube enters the focuser
im not sure whether amazon carries any but there are lowprofile adapters that minimize this effect and are better for astrophotographyi thought that this will work perfectly on leica confocal microscope but diameter was a millimeter more than expected
didnt return for the shipping cost and time i didnt have to spend for itonce you realize that you have to put a lens inside this before you attach it to your camera it works great
if you didnt realize that or didnt realize that there should be directions included gee theres a concept than you would think this is a horrible investment
now that i figured out i needed to put a lens in there before attaching it to my camera im very happythis part goes in your telescope in place of your eyepiece
it attaches to the tring purchased separately so you can fit your camera on to your telescope to begin taking pictures of the night sky
i found this piece good but its very short i wish it had further adjustment other than just what the telescope provides in order to really get your images at the correct focal point
i had difficulty getting the moon in focus using this with the celestron tring for my nikon d mounted on a celestron powerseeker eq
other than that its a good starting point for beginning with astrophotographyim able to use a sony nex vg with this adapter
ive done lots of playing with it and used it with takumar smc lenses
you will get nice photos and if your camera has hdmi out then you can monitor everything on a big screen
comes in handy when i have family over since everyone wants a turn at the telescopepros solid construction screwed right onto my tring with no difficultycons didnt work with my celestron starseeker  reflector telescope
the focal point of the camera and the focal point of the scope were nowhere near eachotherbottom linecelestron makes a different model model   that includes a x barlow lens that will allow the camera to focus on the image the telescope is seeing
 stars mainly because they should have either included that in the box or removed the universal monikerthis is overall just fairit took  days to deliver from east coast to phx az it should take no more than  days to deliverpart itself is not so ruggedbuilt even flimsy a little with thin aluminum that holds camera andor eyepiece if small enough to fit inthis part should cost no more than  its not even real complex or even precision parton this part celestron was not so impressiveim hesitant to recommend this to othersthese pads mostly reduce vibration by increasing the surface area of the tripod feet
they have some sort of dampening material sandwiched between the top and bottom of the pads
it feels overly hard to the touch but is probably correctly damped when loaded and the pads seem very expensive for what you get
i would suggest you try making your own first unless you are happy to pay for this productthese are very nice quality pads for dampening the vibration under your tripod
they also have the benefit of providing soft cushions with nice grip if you store your scope indoors on hardwood floors etc
the only problem i have with them is that  is a lot for a round chunk of plastici bought these for astro photography
i havent seen a huge difference but it helps calm down the vibration after being focused or touchedthese pads are used to help stabilize your telescope tripod mount one pad goes under each tripod leg you wont see much improvement with these when using high power eyepieces and though they do seem to help a bit when using a higher power eyepiece mm or better just touching the scope will cause it to shake
these do help if you are using a camera to take pictures or video of what you are viewingthey really dont help that much unless you have a pretty heavy telescope
most of the giggling i had was where my ota attached to the mount i didnt know this until i purchased these because they did nothing for the problem
i reinforced the inside of the ota and no more giggles with or without the suppression padsbefore you buy take a good hard look elsewhere and save the moneypurchased these to try and help dampen down the shakes when touching the focuser of my telescope
they help a little but not what i was hoping for
ultimately i am just going to need a sturdier tripod
very expensive for what they arethis controlled my older tv and vcr but would not work my newer toshiba dvd writer drw
i tried all the codes they suggested then scanned thru all the codes a couple times before giving up
otherwise i like the feel and operation of the uniti never wind up with a complete recording of my input thus i bought a digital recorder which at this moment i cannot find
i liked this in the early beginnings but operating it in the night time is very difficult because the action keys are not clearly visiblei teach a counseling skills course at a local community college and needed this for the students to turn in an audio recording of an interview
not all students are into the digital realities of today so this analog tape recorder did the tricki gave it three stars cause it only runs on batteries  theres no where to plug in an ac adaptor my preferenceif ya gotta go tape this unit is alrightas a warning when used with a standard outlet wall box this surge protector will block both outlets in all scenariosthere is a sticker on this thing that says not for use with aquariums or other waterrelated products
what the heck does that mean
i bought this to use on a modern washing machine  the kind loaded with electronics and a motherboard
is a washing machine a waterrelated product
how about a coffee maker
if it gets damaged are they going to say the guarantee is invalid because of those weasel wordsmy first complaint about this is probably a single case situation
no ac adaptor that i buy works
i called customer service and they told me theyld send me one for free
they were very friendly and helpfull about ittrouble is i never got it
i use rechargable batteries now insteadmy second complaint is the navigation
unless you have a playlist set up you may want to navigate a lot and its not easy
once you do scroll through the list of whats usually  songs when you find the one you want often it takes  seconds to load the song
this doesnt happen if it just plays through themonly if you navigate to them
it appears to be trying to determine how that particular song is coded mp mp bitrate etc but i dont know why it takes so long unless its prebuffering the entire songhowever the abilty to play cds and cdrs with over  songs on one disc is so useful
no memory sticks  just record all your cds onto a few cds and take those with you wherever you go
it never skips has decent battery useage and a very simple and useful onwire remote control so you can keep the player out of harms waythe sony remote controller is suitable for techno geeks only but not for your wife or not for someone who has already been intimidated by simpler remote control units
i bought this to give my wife one key configuration of her home av systems but it cant do it
the failure is due less to limitations in the sony remote as to the stupidity of the av components themselves notably the television
while the rmav is well engineered it suffers from  flaws that should be considered prior to purchase for less ambitious use
none of these would fail it
the units flaws start with its bulk
it is not intended for one handed use
the next  flaws are interrelated
the display is virtually impossible to read under all normal lighting conditions unless normal for you means shining a spotlight onto it
you must turn on the backlight
the second readability flaw results from the back reflections from the smooth faceplate
this is annoying whether trying to read the display with or without the backlight on
sony would be well advised to change this to a diffusing faceplate or to add an antireflective coating to the existing faceplate
possibly you could add your own diffuser
i havent tried this so dont know what degree of improvement would occurthe unit fails with us due to the way certain function codes such as onoff for most av devices and video mode for the tv set toggle rather than having specific infrared codes to activate them
thus when finger fumbling friends or your wife button push this or other controllers or the buttons on one or more of the av components and get your components into altered states no single macro on this remote can reset your entire av equipment back to baseline
this is not sonys fault because even the smartest most programmable controller cant make up for the inherent stupidity of the equipment its trying to control
the end result though is that i own an intelligent universal remote and still have to live with individually assuring that the onoff and video mode states of the equipment are correct
this means that for my wife instead of having to deal with  separate controllers that she doesnt understand she has to deal with a single controller that she has to switch into  different control modes that she doesnt understandpitythis is a nicely packaged unit which is relatively easy to program
unlike some remotes it is shaped so that you can rest it on your leg while sitting and it will stay due to the shape of the bottom of the device
it also can be placed on a flat surface and has just enough tilt so it can be read easily
the only issue is that i found the display a little dificult to read due to the limited contrast
i found i had to use the backlight even in the daytime but it still wasnt that legiblethis is a universal control by sony
theoretically once programmed you can put away the sea of remotes you have and do it all with this onethe goodhas learning remote function when the preset numbers dont work for your componenthas physical buttons for channel updown volume updown and menu navigation  and they can be reprogrammedlooks professionalused ones are cheap and sony has a downloadable manual onlinethe badthe manual is poorly written and badly organized  it is a bad learning curve to set the remote functionsthe learning function can be idiosyncratic requiring you to dim the room lights and try many times for some functionsthe default lcd contrast comes barely readable and even when optimized is unreadable without the backlightthe characters are pretty small on the lcd button areasneither my sony bluray dvd nor my fairly old sony av unit worked with any of the factory codesthe really bad  if you wait too long to change the batteries you may lose all the programmingone more recommendation  if your significant other is as nontechnical as mine buy a very simple big buttom tv remote control for them to use
it will save both of you a lot of frustrationthe sound quality from the mdrg is excellent with crystal clear output at the highest volume and minimal distortion
these headphones were obviously designed with portable cd players in mind
while the sound quality is nice the design is to say the least unique
rather than forcing the user to ruin their carefully sculpted hair style by putting headphones over it these phones go behind the neck saving face and hairthe design does present a few problems though
the first is the lack of size adjustment
luckily my head is neither too big or too small but it can definitely be a problem to people with smaller or larger heads
sounds silly i know but being too tight or too big can seriously cause discomfort
my friend bought these headphones and had the problem with her ears getting sore because she couldnt adjust the earpieces
one warning to all though prolonged use does cause irritation on the tops of the ears
also to people with glasses you might want to reconsider buying these particular headphones because the phones themselves take over the whole ear preventing you from properly putting on your glassesthe other drawback in the design is the bleedthrough more so on these than other openear design headphones
be careful of the volume if travelling on a bus or a plane because the people sitting around you will definitely hear what you are listening tobut all that said i am happy with these headphones though i see the drawbacks for many people and experienced a few of them myself
for the price these are a great deal
for sound quality these have it where it counts for design its depends on the personsound was good but too hot on the ears for exercising in the gym
i switched to the in ear headphonesmy mp jukebox came with a similar behindtheneck style headphones that i really liked so i thought id try these sony ones
i cant say enough for the sound qualityfor a relatively cheap set of headphones its really excellent
however the headphones were really uncomfortable for me
they were quite tight but more of a problem was how sore my ears got wearing them
this may be because i wear glasses or maybe due to my smallerthannormal ears im not sure
i just havent had trouble with other similar headphones before
i even tried removing the extra ear grips these have nice for if you are doing something really active
that did help some but i still couldnt stand to wear them
id recommend them for the sound quality though just be aware of possible problems with comfortthese fit snugly and are reasonably comfortable for extended periods but the earpieces get sweaty and cumbersome during long workouts
i was reasonably impressed with the bass compared to the other  or  ontheear headphones in this price range ive tried
these are my backup pair when i cant find other headphones
for times when i dont need sports headphones ill probably use buds
for sports the ones where the little speaker fits sideways into the ear seem to work better for mesave your money this really did nothing for neither my internet nor tv quality or speedi should have returned it but kept hoping it was something i was doing wrong then a comcast supervisor came to my home and told me i shouldnt use itthe real problem is comcast generally and the quality of their signal which cant be improved uponi bought this to boost my cable siginal which i was splitting between my tv dvr and computer
the improvement wasnt as noticible as i had expected
it does provide a boost for my rabbit ears
i had been using an old radio shack amplifier that i purchased about  years ago
i dont think it was much of an improvement over my old uniti bought this amp to raise the signal for my home because i have a marginal signal
i have diagnostic menus in my cable boxes and dvr so it is easy to check the results
with no amp the signal to noise ratio was db and said fair agc fair with the motorola amp the signal to noise raised to db fair and agc fair
this amp did not help at all
my symptoms were pixilationfreezing and video burping
resold this amp to someone elsei have since bought this amp from amazon pct port bidirectional cable tv hdtv amplifier signal booster with passive return path and it is greatthis is my review of the amp mentioned abovethis drop amp puts the motorola drop amp to shame
it is sooooo much better and less expensivei would recommend this to all who need a drop amp
since i have a metering page on a menu inside my motorola cable and dvr boxes it was easy for me to tell the results
before any amp it was sn dbfair and agc fair
with this amp it now reads sn  db good and agc goodpct port bidirectional cable tv hdtv amplifier signal booster with passive return paththis amp has cleaned up all my pixilation and audio dropouts on my cable boxes and my dvr as welli have comcast cable as my providerthis amp is light years ahead of the motorola amp for the price and features you need to buy this one insteadthis signal booster worked well when i first got it and my cable company had both analog and digital signals
when the cable company changed the signal to digital it no longer worked as well and i had to replace iti wanted to get a better signal out of my tv cable so i bought this amplifier
i did not get the result i wanted
so i bought another one from radio shack same gain and connected two of them in series
there is a small change but still grainy picturesarrived on time
did not use
returned to seller since i subsequently purchased the same booster with  output portsthe motorola signal booster is very easy to install once you get the right configuration see below
its very well made with high quality components at least those that you can see
the problem with this type of device is that its difficult to evaluate its performance
i installed it on a tv connected to a digital cable service comcast downstream from a signal splitter
the picture was digitizing on some channels making it unpleasant to watch just on those channels
the motorola seems to have helped the situation but i still get some pixelation only less often
its my opinion that the signal booster has helped but i cant tell to what degreealso do not install this device inline before a router
i did this first because i wanted to boost my internet performance as well as the tv
it overwhelmed the router causing it to stop working
i was able to straighten it out after talking with support at comcast the modem manufacturer and the router manufacturer but it took a while
i would have preferred to have skipped this whole episode and would have if the instructions had simply told me not to install it in that configurationin general motorola manufactures good products
i accept that this signal booster is doing what its supposed to do
its just hard to tell if it is or notthis amplifier has enhanced the signal quality of my television but the tv still blinks off sometimes
the antennae has a fairly short cable so i thought i wouldnt not continue to have reception issues after this purchase
too badmy radio shack signal booster worked fine at nearly half the cost
it has two outputs and a dial to control the amount of boost
save some doughi have always preferred headband style radios over armband radios while running so i am in a constant search for the right one
too often sony and others develop their headband radios which are fairly obviously targeted to joggers exercisers and other active people but then forget about that target in final production
ive used previous models of headband radios that provide superior comfort and stability on the head
early on the problem was that they would rust out from the salt in my perspiration
newer models have solved that problem but created another
the quotstreet stylequot behind the head technique of wearing this unit has a lot of promise
but it can be very uncomfortable to all but the smallest heads
they should really fit these to a regular sized western male instead of to a tiny thai women
that said it does have a stable and quiet fit even after several miles
but it will hurt your ears a bitas to reception and sound
wellive seen it better in other units
i wont say it is poor
but it could be better
and i know this because i could compare it to another sony model the analog tuning twin of this one
the mega bass isnt as mega and the fm capture is weaker
the weather and tv bands are neat but not very practical
and i have some concerns about the funky sliding battery cover
it works but i just dont trust it
one plus is that the ear units attach to the loop internally
my last pair had a metal set screw that rusted and broke
all in all i give it  stars average and i will keep it until i find a better one
a redesigned and lighter version of the flawed srfhm would be the trick
get it together sonyi gave this s to my mom for mothers day
after a few weeks the very fine speaker wire that runs inside of the headband somehow became unsecured and exposed
it was then accidentally pulled as my mother removed it one day and the fine wire tore rendering the unit unplayableit has been almost impossible contacting sony for repair
when i finally reached them the repair costs for this small repair were unwarranted and i ended up purchasing a new unit at a discount outlet
sony is engineering is good but their service is terrible
this is not a good prospect for a consumer in the long runi would say the cons are it does start hurting where it goes around your ear
luckily the ear tips of mine broke off which makes it a little more comfortable
fm reception is fair
could be better
it does need an antenna for better fm reception
it can do without the tv channels
weather channel is okay to have
oh but your ears get sore maybe if you wear them enough times your ears get numb to themi purchased this to replace my old sports walkman when i forgot to take it with me on a month long overseas trip
i loved my old one dont have a model number its about  years old
the reception was great i could change stations by feel and it took whatever abuse i gave it which typically included dropping it on the pavement at least once a weeki have to say im a bit disappointed with the srfmv
when shopping i immediately noticed all the changes and assumed they would all be for the better but not sopros  its lightweight and the shape fits nicely on my arm
running with it strapped to my arm doesnt bug me the way i thought it might and its a nice change from the radio pulling on my shorts
there is the option to strap it onto your shorts but since it seems ok on my arm i havent tried it yet
the reception equals the reception on my old one and ive never had any complaints
the headphones are lightweight and theyve shortened the cord which keeps the excess from flopping around but limits what you can do with it
ive only dropped this one a couple times and it hasnt suffered but the battery compartment does pop opencons  it brags of  presets but you cant really do it by feel since they are numbered and not just an updown button
when im running im not particular as long as its music and not talking
scanning up and down worked pretty well for me
grabbing my left arm with my right hand and looking slightly down to see what im doing while running is a bit awkward
dont know if it would be better hooked on my shorts or not
the buttons are not recessed so if you bump anything you get instant station change or even worse just a tap up or down on the station you are on
you can use the quotholdquot feature to avoid this but then you have to take it off hold if you want to change stations
i should probably purchase different headphones but im trying to avoid spending the money
the headphones are ok not great not terrible
the short cord was annoying this morning when i hooked the radio to my camelbak for a bike ride and it kept pulling the phones back because it wasnt long enough to drape over the backpack and up into my helmet
the worst feature is the volume control
for active sports an updown button would work best
surprisingly they stuck with the dial method
and the placement couldnt be worse
everytime i grab this thing i inadvertently hit that volume dial
i cannot count the number of times i have almost come out of my skin when i either turn it on and its been turned up too loud or when i change the station and accidentally grab the volume dial
a word of advice  dont ever turn this thing on with the headphones on your head it could damage your hearingits nice that this radio has amfmtvwb not that i can use anything but fm right now living in the outback
perhaps i will appreciate the  presets more when i get back to the states
but for me since i use this radio exclusively for running and cycling simpler would be better
a sports walkman designed for a blind person would be perfect for me as i dont want to look at it when im using it
if youre looking for a portable radio with lots of features you might like this
if youre looking for something simple to use that will provide distraction from your own heavy breathing when exercising think before buying this onefor a product designed for sports minded people this radio doesnt seem to be designed sturdy enough to take that kind of usage
its lightweight which in theory makes it easy to take along wherever you go
and to this it runs on twoaaa batteries so were not bogged down by the weight of the traditional aa batteries
that in itself is a drawback
the battery life just doesnt cut it
if you used this as an everyday item you would certainly change batteries far more too often than you would like
the battery life is also based on what youre listening to
am stations use less juice than fm or tvalthough the digital tuning and the option of assignging your favorite stations is nice the drawback is that you have a certain timeframe between changing batteries otherwise everything is wiped from memory meaning you also have to reset the clock tooi also find the reception is best either outdoors the whole purpose of a sports radio or places where there isnt any electronic equipment
the radio is really suspectible to interference from all sorts of devices
otherwise youll hear a lot of static and disrupted soundsthe tv tuner is also a good addition but not very handy if you live in areas where reception is poor or even still live in one of those places where all the major stations are carried on the uhf bandwith
im also one of those types that have always found having weather channels on the radio a rather pointless addition
for me it never gets used  i always get my weather from the local news station
for others who really must know the weather wherever they go itll probably be an assetlastly the headphones does its job but ive found with the thin wires its always getting tangled or im accidentally flinging the headphones off while moving aroundlatest firmware  doesnt reliably pass dhcp to the wired network
linux wont work at all windows barely works
the unit i bought has very weak reception compared to a friends so it is going back
appears to be same hardware internally as similar device from dlinki used this for a couple of years and it worked flawlessly
initially i did not use wep
i caught someone on my network so i enabled wep security
now the bridge no longer connected
so i tried to run the setup again and reconfigure
i was never able to connect ever  again
not sure what the reset button does but did not seem to make a differenceive owned a lot of linksys products
the main thing ive noticed since they were bought by cisco  most of the products do not last more that  to  months before they start failing
ive been through  routers and  modems in less than  years  all on an apc ups yes it works for xbox live the primary reason i purchased it
however as my friends and i found out this weekend system link does not work through the wet or at least not the games we tried  ghost recon and halo
this has been verified by several websites around the internetim disappointed
it works great for live so ill keep it if i cant convince linksys to give me a refund but not being able to play system link when my buddy comes over is a bummerthis box is almost a bridge  but not quite
in particular it ends up putting its own ethernet address on packets which is ok for basic ip use but if for example youre using this to extend a network and have a dhcp server on the basestation side of the net if that dhcp server is iscbased it will send responses that dont get correctly forwarded
on the other hand if youre just forwarding a link and have a nat or other local dhcp server on the wetside network itll work finethis device is great in concept and this particular model was an excellent choice a couple of years ago
the concept is still great but there are better choices out there than this one
the main problem is that the technology is out of date
being purely b this still runs at mbs best case and maybe half that speed in actual use
there are other a and g options that are several times as fastother specific issues i had with this model and the reasons i say its quirky area it couldnt connect to my access point unless the access point broadcast its ssid
if both devices have the same ssid this shouldnt be necessary and is less secureb if you want to use a channel other than  you need to change it from infrastructure to adhoc mode change the channel and then change it back to infrastructure morec it couldnt connect to my access point if the access point was in mixed bg mode
i had to switch the access point to b onlyif i were to buy another wireless bridge id get one thats g compatiblethe sangean  performs very wella quality instrument
comes with ac converterear buds a roll up antenna and a very nice soft casea lot of radio for the moneyi have not listened to radio for a long time and am dismayed a the qualitylots of talk and trash musici guess that is the way things are goingany wayi am glad i bought that radiohi folks its vince the radioman 
i have a large collection of radios and i love to do compares and share my thoughts
the ats  and   if youve seen my reviews are great buys and probably sangeans best radios
the  is a very good buy for someone who want single side band and cant spend a large amount of money the  is the least expensive radio out there with side band and fine tuning kh increments
the overall construction and quality of the build is ok at best and the radio is a little top heavy and bulky 
the tuner sensativity is far better than the grundig yb on am and fm but on sw the  is about equal on its best day
the step down to  kh tuning is inconvenient where you need to push in the tuning dial to go to the fine tuning mode
the dynamic range and selectivity is good but the ats  blows this radio away same price  but the  has no ssb
the new eton e   probably the best of the new eton line for the money also blows it away but no ssb
so  if you want ssb and a fairly decent radio for a low price this is a no brainer
if you want a midsized and priced radio for amsw and fm get the eton e  or the sony sw or the sangean ats ive owned this radio since may and feel ive used it sufficiently long enough to merit a valid opinion
my first radio was a transistor unit back in the early s and ive owned or used countless portable units since
my first reaction upon using this radio was to send it back
then after reflecting on the abundance of stellar ratings i thought maybe i was missing something and needed to give it a fair shake
so i didnt seek an rma but i also didnt feel like the hassle
that said now having exercised a sufficient amount of cognitive dissonance i also dont feel bad about having kept it
but one thing drives me crazy reception while walking
i live in a major population area adjacent to countless powerful radio stations
so signal is not an issue
when trying to walk one must constantly adjust the ear bud wire which doubles as the antenna
even presumably stronger stations seem to require antenna adjustment
if youre stationary you can adjust the antenna and listen without any problems via the units speaker or ear buds
i also dont see its ability to pull in distant signals particularly impressive
otherwise sound quality is excellent and the radio is solidly built
it uses two aaa batteries and is easy on power consumption
i see it as a perfect radio for use while working in a shop or to use in the event of power outage
for walking i now use my mp player
otherwise i still think its ok nothing more nothing lessi was intrigued by the reviews of the previous version of the sangean pocket radio fmam dtv wthe now obsolete tv band and the need to have a portable radio perform as well as a car radioi walk in an area  miles from my stations of interest and have had lots of reception issues with previous portable mp devices with radio receivers lots of fading and directional issues etc
the current model is a dt wo tv band and is the one pictured and still titled as the dtv on the amazon sitethis unit although nicely designed is much larger than the sansa player i was previously using
in fact the  aaa batteries alone are larger than my previous player
unfortunately it doesnt perform better in any way and i think most portable digital receivers in mp players will perform as well if not better for lots less costfor those needing am capability the dt is even more disappointing
the units am  fm receiving capabilities are no where close to pervious sangean table or shower radios i have used and dont come close to tivoli or the much reviewed gerca superadio
i think this model has been value engineered out of its outstanding statusive had it for  months now
my biggest complaint lousy reception for all but a few stations which are very strong
it has no built in antenna
wow
they saved a tenth of a cent of aluminum
a great saving for them with the tradeoff being a radio that cant receive stationsinstead it requires use of a pair of headphones or a little plug in wire that you can lose in about five minutes to act as an antenna
stations that my car or home stereo can pick up with ease are filled with static drift in and out or have bleed thru from other stations which are not that close on the dial
even at the gym where the tvs are broadcasting on their own little fm station from a handful of feet away and the radio is stationary on the treadmill the station can be filled with static and drift in and out
without headphones or the losable wire theres nothing but staticno battery meter either so it just dies very suddenly
with a pair of nimh batteries i get maybe  hours which is okay but nothing greatbutton controls are a little confusing not well labeled and clunky wading through all the station presets in a serial mannercant see myself buying another one of these when this one bites the dustafter using the sangean dt for a couple years while working it finally gave up after i dropped it into a mud puddle i purchased this radio as it is small enough to fit into a jeans back pocket has a digital tuner has a button lock switch and i didnt need the weather band function of the dtin general i like the radio but i was disappointed that it doesnt have a clock display when it is turned off the dt has this feature
in addition setting the station memory is a little cumbersome and the button lock switch is in an unusual place on the radiooverall decent sound from the speaker i mostly tune to am talksports radio stations and i like the size
a decent radio for how im using it but i may go back to the dti dont have a radio in my truck so i bought this to have something to listen to while driving but it seems to have alot of static noise on every channelmy first vcr worked great and when i needed to replace my second vcr i assumed i was doing a good thing by buying an identical rca
boy was i wrong
the second vcr refused to play any tapes recorded on other vcrs
other vcrs cant play anything recorded on it
incredibly irritating because the whole point of two vcrs was so that my daughter could watch recorded shows in the other roomfootnote  the one that i thought was good just ate a brand new tape and refuses to turn on
its going into the garbage with the other onedid a lot of research with consumer reports on vcrs as were in the market for a second one
they dont rate any of them quotexcellentquot and only a few get quotvery goodquot  i think this reflects the industrys investment in these machines  just arent putting the quality into them any more
that being said this machine works okay for my purposes
so far no troubles only  months old its fairly easy to use and i do like the quotcommercial advancequot and index features
also its fairly compacti bought this unit for two reasons  to play mps and view dvds
it seems to handle dvds fine but the mp features are a mere afterthought
it will not shuffle play mps which means you either start with track  and play the whole disc through  tracks or you have to tediously program the tracks you want
what was sony thinking
so i replaced it with a samsung dvds which better suits my needsas a personal gps and especially at walking or sailing speeds the gps v is fine
the display is ok for casual use and the unit is able to hold the maps for more land or water than you can sail or ride over in a day
if you arent in a hurry or especially demanding then you should be delighted with this unit
i have it as my primary gps and it isnt sufficiently problematic that i intend to replace it ill soldier on and hope for some software updates for nowfor use in cars and for more demanding users there are some significant drawbacksduring configuration it takes around an hour to load a full set of maps kbps is not sufficient for loading mb of data in reasonable time
this discourages modifying the map set which reduces usability if you live round a big citythe processor performance is borderline
for normal use the low power consumption of a relatively slow processor allows good battery life
for car use the power consumption is not an issue but the time taken to redraw the screen which can be many seconds becomes extremely significant
the menus are slow it can take a couple of seconds to go between two entries in a list and im not even using waas
routing also takes some time mostly this isnt too important because once you are on a route it shouldnt recalculate oftenthere are some bugs which may have been fixed recently
when i upgraded the firmware the unit started dropping out during route calculation
i wrote to garmin about this but got absolutely no response
thats a mark down for customer support toothe address entry is cumbersome
in addition if you dont cancel any other route that was in operation the unit will interrupt and discard your tedious entry if it completes the calculation
if it doesnt then it will start on the new routedirections can be slow to paint the wrong directions are sometimes shown until the unit catches up and swaps over to the correct picture
if one turn follows another fairly rapidly it may not tell you about the second turn until after the turn has passed this is associated with the slow repaintwhen routing information is shown the native menus of the interrupted screen are not available so if you have a sequence of directions to follow and wish to do something else the unit keeps interrupting and refusing your menu selections there are no menu entries in the routing screenperhaps i should have bought a more expensive model but what could i get that is reasonably portablefinally some of the routes would best be described as entertaining or on a less charitable day indirect
for example when the route from via del oro via bernal road to us  is being followed in san jose ca the directions will sometimes tell you to cross bernal road ignoring the left turn and then to take three right turns
on other occasions it will indicate the left turn
routing seems dependant on precise locationfinally customer support at garmin did not respond
id be happy to help them make this a better product but theyd need to be interestedlast time i checked there were no further software updates so it looks like garmin arent interested in their legacy customers
that means my next gps will have to be from someone elsei found another routing amusement
returning from the far north of california i didnt include the marin county maps but i had included sacramento because i had intended to return on i
when i got well down us a mountain range and probably  miles off i i was getting crazy arrival times
eventually i found that at ukiah it wanted me to turn east and cross to i because i didnt have the detailed map for the next hundred miles of us to richmond where the bay area maps resumed
it should not favor the downloaded maps to this extenton the bright side this and my old gps iii continue to function almost as advertised
years of faithful if slightly eccentric servicei now have a tomtom navigator  and their bluetooth gps receiver and iguidance  for europe
the newer software and receiver puts this old machine in a better light than you might think
true the sirf iii receiver is significantly better than this old garmin
it may be old and slow and hard to use compared to the newer machines but it does have an almost clairvoyant ability to correctly estimate trip times
if you are looking for an instrument that can record tracks and will show you a lot of current data course eta time to destination altitude track bearing to destination time to next waypoint distance to next waypoint altitude speed time of day date trip distance trip time  then this will be a lot more use to you than the late  tomtom and iguidance software
but for them my pda has the high detail maps for the entire us canada and uk and it took less time to install than it takes to copy half the bay area to this unitif im heading for the woods or the water this is still the best gps for mei realize theres a learning curve involved but here are a few thoughts on the garmin v my first gpsso far its a good compass and speedometer but it thought i was on a parallel road to the freeway for a halfhour during my test trip this morning
maybe the accuracy level can be set somehow but between the six manuals that come with the system havent stumbled upon this item yetthe  street maps i downloaded from the cd disappeared when i changed batteries
warning
make sure your unit runs out of juice while youre in your car while running and the unit still plugged into the lighter
this is the only way to avoid redownloading mapsit takes forever to punch in lettersnumbers under quotfindquot you cant delete elevation numbers no delete buttonthe backlight goes off but hopefully stays on when darkim sure a lot of my complaint is due to my own impatience but this attribute is what gets me lost in the first place
gps should be designed for stressed people with a short attention spani enjoyed their sound while they lasted but a weird thing happened to them the rubber coating on the cord the part between the two earbuds that goes behind your neck started splitting into ribbons and breaking off
its not like i was abusing it i dont understand what happened to it
since then ive been using a sennheiser cxb which has been greathave to give it three stars because i honestly cant say how it is
i purchased a nikon s camera and below the item the battery was included in the customers who bought this item also bought since my camera was the s i assumed it was the right battery because it said it worked in a nikon  nope
too big and the contacts are wrong
i gave three stars only because ive had nikon products before and they were always goodlasted me  weeks
used at the gym  times a week
the sounds great super light weight and easy to carry in a pocket when folded
however the wires to each ear are very very thin and fragile
to be called sports headphones one would think they were more durable
left earphone lost sound and i threw them outthe sony headphones arent anything spectacular theyre just alright
i notice some crackling when i hook them up to any device but theyre sturdy and compact
i just put them in my purse and gothese headphones fit well and are much better than the ear bud styles
those never stay in place
i also like how they collapse and are therefore much more portable to take the gymthe downside i have experienced is these phones have lasted me about  days and then stop workingi use them almost daily on the treadmill and can feel the sweat building up
it appears that the sweat eventually shorts out the earphonesi do like these headphones for overall performance and cost
i keep several on hand knowing they wont last very long
my issue is they unexpectedly stop working usually in the middle of my workout and must finish my workout on the treadmill in silencei will try the behind the head version as wellafter breaking my fourth headphone after  weeks i can no longer recommend these headphonesi would recommend the sony mdr g s sports headphone without the folding option
the folding joints break too easilyif you do order them you should order multiple copies as you will need them
or be very careful each time you fold and unfold themthat said these are great sports headphones
they are great for high sweat activites like running and allow enough ambient noise in to hear approaching hazards behind and around you
these headphones are far superior to the earbud types out there for athletic activityi liked these for the most part but the plastic is cheap and they broke pretty quick because of that
the sound still works but the headphones had to be taped back together
good for cheap headphones but lacking true quality craftsmanshipi use it when i am jogging and it does not fall off and also sounds greatthe main issue is the plastic folding mechanism
i can already see the strain on the plastic joints when i fold and unfold
i have already stopped folding it to prevent breakage stars
could have made better joints or used metal encased in plastic body for rigidityas a portable music user since the mid s i have gone through many many sony headphones over the years
from using outrageously priced tiny cassette walkmans to minidisc to mp players
in the old days it was no problem to chuck the headphones that came with the players and buy a quality replacement pair for around twenty dollars
not so now
these headphones are ok for casual everyday use i use mine for walkinghiking so i cant comment on exercisesweat endurance
i dont find them near as fragile as a lot of users are making them out to be but i also dont expose them to any rough handling
the plastic is not as durable as the old sonys were but is fine if you do no major folding or extreme flexing of the headbandsound quality is just ok with  kbps mp files on my sandisk m   players not much high end detail or solid bass but you can do a lot worse for a lot more money
headphones are comfortable enough and really stay in placeall in all a good buy for the ten bucks you pay
buy two with one for a spare and i think you will be happy with thempros love the folding ability good enough sound sweat does not seem affect it
cheapcons short lifetime after heavy abuse even though they are advertised as exercise headphonesfinal verdict worth it if you dont mind buying new ones every once in a whilesummary i have bought these and worked out to them for years
the folding mechanism makes them be able to take more punishment while they are in my gym bag
but the amount of abuse from running on the treadmill will eventually wear out the connections to the speakers as invariably one of the speakers will start to cut out after heavy use
but they are so cheap i just keep buying new ones maybe  pairs over as many years
i have yet to find a really good pair that can take a beating sound good and stay on my head while running as well as these can
if you find one let me knowi was deployed to kuwaitiraq earlier this year and decided to pick one of these up in the states at my mobe station before flying out here im still here
i have a lot of mixed feelings with this product
i have also put this product through endless abuse and have a good idea of its downfallsthe two places i use this player is indoors in barracks but usually in a living tent
the other place is on missions i bring this in the hummer or whatever vehicle im in to listen to music on long drives since we dont normally get radios in the vehicles
on these trips the system has to put up with hot weather ranging from dry to very humid a lot of dust and sand sometimes in sandstorms exposure to sun and long operation sometimes over  hours in a daythe system has mostly held up
indoors the sound is pretty decent and has some good bass
my biggest complaint with the sound is lack of eq control
on trips with all the background noise and movement the esp holds up really well hardly ever skips turning off the bassboost clears up the sound at loud volumes and the jog stick works well
one problem that i have had in the past few months though is that it starts acting up sometimes and will skip on any cd
it doesnt always do this but there have been a few days where it just couldnt play a cd without severe skipping throughout each track
it seems to get worst on the final tracks
indoors it rarely does this
the headphone amp works great i can crank up the volume pretty high on some high power consumption headphones with no problem
the jog stick comes in handy at night or when im not lookingby far the biggest problem is reading mp files and cdrs
my unit has read certain mp discs ok but it has problems reading a lot of my mp discs
it also has problems with the slightest spec of dust
even with some brand new burnt cds it has problems
i have a philips exp mini cd mp player and it can read the same cds much better
if there are any scratches it can skip over them and will never skip since it reads the whole file at once rather than continuously spinning and reading like the sony does
if the sony gets caught on an mp file it emits a horrible hissing and scratching sound and often locks up or freezes on the file
it gets annoying
if this system could read files like my other mp player and hold up on other cdrs without skipping it would get  stars
i almost wish i bought the philips mp boombox instead
it doesnt look like it can handle as much abuse but i feel that their method of reading mps is far superiorthe units took a lot of beatings dirt water moisture and heat and it still works
if you are looking for a really tough cd boombox and dont care for mps so much then buy it
out here we have seen a lot of other boomboxes and mp boomboxes from companies like rca and cheap brands sold in the px that couldnt hold up in the conditions out here and quickly brokesome of them only wrote once
i normally buy memorex and they work well not sure what happened with this batchthese are good replacement speakers for gm truck
sound is good for the size i will buy again if neededwhile its true that someone sitting next to you on a plane would have difficulty seeing your screen its not hidden from people sitting behind you or people walking down the aisle etc
it simply obscures the vision for someone sitting alongside of you
if that persons seat is back and you are forward they will see a bit more than if they were directly parallel to you so that if they lean their seat back they will have line of sight from behind you
so for privacy i give it a the other issue is the ability to remove it once you place it on
there are two systems for attaching the screen to the laptop one is permanent with double sided tape and the other should allow you to attach and remove it via creating channels with plastic stick on tabs
the problem is that its really difficult to slide the screen in and out of the tabs without doing some damage to the screen or tabs
on my laptop the side tabs stay in place but the bottom tabs fall off so that the screen is usually on an anglei dont know that there are any filters out there that work better to protect your privacy this is a nice thick well made and durable screen
however there must be filters that attach with a better methodi bought another brand for new laptop and tried this on my wifes laptop
she didnt like it so now i have something to clutter my technology drawerthis protectorprivacy guard is as advertised
i was able to use my laptop on the airplane without having to look over my shoulder
it does fall out very easy
i would recommend cleaning your table screen prior to installing
use all of the plastic attachement pieces to secure yours
i have lost mine due to only using two and was always sliding back into placei got my item within a week even though it is mentioned it will take a while to deliver
item condition is also good but it is not m original product
it is not perfectly fit to my office laptop levevo t
i knew earlier but price was so cheap compare to all others
i bought it main duty of privacy filter is to hide screen from others who seats near to you that is working perfectly
my near mate always thinks what i am doing in my laptop because he cant see anything from that direction
i liked this item not loved it because original m privacy filter i saw it it is very cool and awesome compare to what this item is
anyways it worked for me i am now happily working in office without worry what others can see in my laptop screen lol
i enjoy it very susceptible to fingerprints
very reflective
very hard to keep in place
the stickies provided to hold it to the screen keep falling  and yes i did clean the area with a solvent before applying themthis product seems fine but it didnt fit any of my w screens
also though these work they considerably darken the screen which means youre using maximum screen brightness all the timei got a this item because my desk area at work is in front of others
additionally i often travel and have curious eyes
this however only worked when i had my screen brightness dimmed to the lowest
when it was slightly brightened the screen is still visible in all angle
yes in all angle
i understand if it would be blocked in a slightly less of a degree but not in this case
so it makes some work more difficult because the backlighting is set so dim to work
for those that usually set their screen brightness at a low level by default then this item will work like a charm
otherwise please be advised
after a while i got use to the dim settingas advertised the m notebook privacy filter does its job by masking what you are typing on the screen from other people
someone seated right next to you cannot tell what is being typed on the screenguaranteed
for people travelling on business with sensitive documentation this filter is a must
for masking personal letters or emails its a mustif you read other reviews from other websites stating it is possible for others to see the screen behind you its true
but itll take someone with super telescopic vision to be able to read the typing from that far away
if they are looking right over your shoulder then you should have the right to give ther person a dirty look and tell them to back off
this filters purpose is to mask unsuspecting eyes from spying from the side view in a crowded environment and that is what it does
its not  thoughfrom a sixty degree angle your screen will appear really dark but it is more than enough to mask what you are typingthis  filter fits perfectly into an ibm thinkpad x
it clamps right on it making it seem like a part of your notebook
theres no sticky adhesives necessary to keep it onso why am i giving it only three stars
well in my opinion there is absolutely no logical justification to make it so expensive
at most i could understand if they charged this product for something like  or so but asking for  retail is just plain ridiculous
even half that amount is too much
its simply a piece of plastic
i was lucky and got mine at an auction for  but it is too pricy for private use seriouslyi must say the product do what it is mean to dobut i have been using it for a week and i still dont get use to glare the screen madei have try using backwards whit the gold side looking inside the screeni still provide privacy but know with a dark glare instead of the golden onethe dark glare is less disturbing but still to glossy for mealso what i dont like is that the privacy filter works only to block people next to you and not above you or far next to youso i was very excited to receive my item in the mail paid a lot more than i normally would for a screen protector at  but loved the thought of having some privacy around the office especially when i have saved all year and actually spent some money on the laptop i have now
howeverwhen i received the case i and opened it and read the instructions it had clear plastic tabs they look like folded up tape that you stick on the side of the laptop and slide the privacy screen in and out of them
wish there had been a picture of these plastic tabs on their display pictures because i wouldnt have bought itand also to make it easier to pull in and out i guess there is a dip in the screen about half the size of a quarter so your screen is only  covered there is a small cemi circle of visibility also not on the display picture
maybe if my screen was a little shorter this wouldnt be a problem but my computer is a true  in needless to say this really cheapened the laptop and i wound up just giving the screen protector to my sister
note my laptop has a black frame maybe if yours was silver or even better white you wouldnt notice the tabs but on black it is really noticeableworks as advertised but dims the screen a good bit even looking straight on
i compensate by increasing the brightness on my screen but that kinda defeats the purpose of long battery life on transatlantic flights
i find myself removing it when im watching videos on a plane so that i can squeeze out more battery life on a dimmer screen then put it back on when im doing emails and workthe product easily slides in place with no stickiness on the screen and is just as easy to remove
the mounting kit holds the privacy screen in place on the sides and bottom letting gravity do the rest
i recommend using the alternate smaller mounts instead of the larger ones
the mounts dont necessarily cause a problem because they are clear but they do blur up a few pixels on the sides of the screen
the smaller mounts included are better for this reasonas for viewing angle a person sitting directly next to you on the plane will still be able to see some of your screen but its doubtful it would be easy for them to read something
they would have to actually be trying to look at your screen
if im in a window seat theres no way someone in the isle seat can see whats on my screen
people sitting two chairs away from me in a conference room said they see only a black screen
but someone right next to me might be able to see my screen clearly if they lean over my way
normally a laptop has about a  degree viewing angle
this product limits the view angle down substantially but you should still be cautious if people are deliberately trying to see your screen
anything more than  degrees off center and the screen turns nearly black
so the normal  degree screen of a laptop is reduced to about  at the most starsthe product does it job of privacy from the side
but the little adhesive comes out if you take off the filter too often
its somewhat of a privacy filter because someone behind you can see your screen
but man taking it off and putting it back on again is a real pain
especially when you have to clean the screen sometimes
i have a tablet pc interestingly it works even for tabletsi bought a privacy screen for my new work laptop a few months back
this is the second m filter that i have purchased the first didnt fit my new laptop
the screen works fairly well
depending on the angle someone is sitting and the amount of light in the room your screen may be visible to others
obviously if someone is sitting behind you or over your shoulder they can see your screeni know that there are other products out there that probably do a better job but my own personal experience is that the m product works well enough for my needs
it is rather expensive though
if this werent reimbursable i would likely not purchase onethe item is not for a  widescreen i have a dell  and it has a w screen but the item didnt fiton the plus side the point was to stop people next to me looking at my screen which is does wellwell for parts of the screen is coversalthough i just received this filter today and have used it very little i would rate this average
the film itself appears to be made well enough and it fits my screen quite well however it is the manner in which the filter is retained to the laptop screen that i do not care for
enclosed with the filter are  small selfadhesive plastic tabsstrips that are used to secure the filter to the pc
i wasnt too happy having to put stickers all over the screen frame on my laptop
despite having  of these stickers in place the filter sags significantly when you first open your pc lid if you put any of the stickers at the top to solve this problem you will have no way of removing the privacy filter
granted the sag goes away after the pc lid is all the way open but it just feels sloppy or cheap to methe privacy filter itself works great
it does affect the sharpness of the display but thats a small price to pay for privacy
my complaint is with the tabs that keep it attached to the screen
i wish they were different so taking the screen on and off as needed was easier
the tabs are really its only downfallworks but not as good as i had hoped because someone sitting in a seat net to me could still see a dim view of the pictures that i was looking at
might be best to help make it difficult for others to read text from the sidethe filter fits well to my hp p  inch screen
however it does not block the view efficiently if i put the filter on the screen unless moving the filter away from the screenwith a new laptop i needed a new privacy screen for my air travel and those nosey neighbors
i was surprised that this product only really darkens the side view not really making it unreadable
well maybe from way over on the side you cannot see the screen but someone sitting next to me can absolutely see the scree  just darker
not as impressed as i thought i would be and not as good as the last privacy screen i bought which was  years ago and dont recall the name brandi had a fellowees privacy filter on my old laptop but had to change to m when i bought the new  inch laptop the problem with the product is the way it is attached to the screen my laptop has a flat screen and this attaching the holding parts of the product to the screen proved to be a real mess
once i was able to hold it together on the screen the privacy filter works excellentlyupdateafter using this product for a week or two the plastic parts attached to the screen starting falling off and it is causing me a nightmare to keep using this product
if you have a flat lcd like those on the new hps then this product is going to be problematic for you other than if your screen has a frame then by all means go ahead and buy the producti like it because people on the bus do not pick on my stuff kind of annoying
but the way it holds on your screen is not the best and a little bit messy
some time it come off
but still like itsome antisnooping screens also prevent glare but not this one
in fact it has a highglare surface that makes it almost useless in many indoor environments where you cant adjust the lighting
the privacy feature works well but the glare makes the screen unusable in many environmentsi see now why the reviews are so torn this product can be good or bad completely depending on the type of laptop you have
i learned this after i bought two of these for my laptops and heres what i found  toshiba touch screen  laptop on a high resolution touch screen i would rate this a star
if you have one of these newer laptops thats touch screen windows  you need to avoid this privacy filter
after one day of use i removed it and never used it again
the touch screen functionalities fall away when you have this on and the high resolution just looks far too faded
also major air bubbles that i could not get out no matter what i did
that and the faded look make it impossible to look at the screen  too distracting  lenovo corporate laptop  perfect
on this laptop i deployed the glue method it stuck on first try no air bubble and no problems
i havent take it off since and its a perfect look and fitif you have a chance to go to a store to see it and talk to someone about it i would recommend that because your experience will truly be unique to your laptopits actually terrible when there is light or a reflection on the screen
in other situations it provides privacy quite well the gold coating seems to add a level of privacyits not a perfect fit but good enough for my usage
i find that its darker than i would like
i understand that its to prevent onlookers on the side to see your screen but its sometimes annoying when i have to squint so much
luckily i only use it on airplanes and public places reducing the possible near vision damage that it would causelove the filter great for using on my work laptop in open spaces
however the prices for these things are outrageous
i mean  for a thin piece of plastic and a few  plastic holdersso the filter gets  stars the price gets  starsi have been a long standing customer of m especially for adhesive products but let me tell you the mounting adhesives are worthless
i have a glossy smooth finish i mounted the privacy filter to and when closing the laptop the adhesive mounts would come unglued
granted i use the product on a laptop which may get a little warm and closing the lid probably loosened them but regular tape adhesive mentioned below works excellent
i got fed up with having to restick the mounts everytime and then try to slide the privacy screen under the mounts edges on both sides  simultaneously to secure it
this is when my big disappointment came
the privacy filter is apparently a stiff plastic with a second plastic coating makes sense except the seam split on the corner edge and peeled apart and now you can not legibly use the product one corner is cloudy nowi finally got angry and used regular clear tape to adhere the filter to the screen
it works a lot better
just wish i would have been smart about it before the engineering mistake cost me i anticipate this is a quality item cannot find it in retail stores  does anyone know if this requires that a person wear a belt or will it clip to a waistband like a cell phone holster does
do any slim camera cases have the spring clip attachment that i am looking for i dont wear beltsi use this little bag to carry my cell phone a couple batteries and memory card
it attaches to my clikelite backpack just fine
for the most part its a well made bag
however the velcro and snap arent very strong and will come loose and the bag will fall off
its happened to me twice in the last couple of months
fortunately i saw it fall off both times and luckily didnt lose it
this one is less than a year old so it really shouldnt have this problem alreadythis case is very well made and designed
however for the canon s is the fit is too tight
yes the eyepiece gets in the way from easily sliding in and once its in there is absolutely no room to spare
you need to use two hands to pry it back out
also if you have the strap attached to the camera too much effort is needed to shove everything into the bag
an alternative i found is the case logic tbc
it is a pretty compact camera bag with an outside pocket and  outside mesh pockets
sears carries this bag for  and is a much better alternative for the canon s is
i am rating the bag  stars because it is one of the better bags on the market but as rated in association with the canon s it only gets  starsthis is a nice bag for the canon s if you have no accessories attached to the camera
however if you have mounted the lahdc lensfilter adapter on your s or s then the camera will not fit in the bag
further there is no room in the bag to store the adapter separately
if you never use filters or accessory lenses then you will be happy with this bagi use it to hold  rechargeable aa batteries and it holds them just fine
i only gave it  stars due to two design flaws it holds the batteries loosely together and if you are in a hurry and dont zip it up completely the batteries will fly all over the place if youre not careful
also if you take out a top set of batteries the bottom set will likely come out of there pouch and will be loose in the bag if you jostle it around a lot
over all not a bad kit but if youre into using a lot of batteries then you might want to look into hard plastic carrierson each of the pockets there is some black webbing thats part of the plastic
what this does is almost completely block the memory card in the pocket
in other words you cant see which card is in the pocket
actually you sometimes cant even tell if theres something in the pocket if you glance quickly
and i need quick access sometimes not fishing into each pocket then looking at each card until i find the right one
yeah i know there are flaps that you can flip but those are kind of gimmicky and sometimes a pain to flip upalso the way this sas
device attaches to a tamrac strap leaves a lot to be desired
the hook on the tamrac straps are small and the loops on this wallet are huge
so it just flops around in the wind
well not the wind but you get the idea its a loose fit
its almost like the tamrac engineers think that photographers only stand straight up dont walk or climb and never set their bags downbattery storage does seem to work okay thougha sidenote there is a pocket the length of the wallet behind the right side
so you can put little things in here like maybe a cardreader
keep in mind it is deep and for little things like maybe a remote they are a bit harder to get outi definitely see some room for improvement on this device but unfortunately its not likely tamrac will make any changesan easy fix for the hiding cards i complained about would be just to change the background material to a different bright color
like yellowthe tamrac wallet works well and cleverly for what it was designed for  carrying extra batteries and memory cards and allowing the user to know which have been used  and that should be enough for most people
me i bought it to carry four compactflash memory cards in their cases and thats it
however i cant give it  stars if it doesnt suit my particular needsi like traveling with as little volume as possible and find that the wallet is too bulky to fit well in my camera bag alongside my olympus camera body lenses spare batteries and other photography odds and ends
getting a larger camera bag would defy the purpose of trimming volume and would make no sense since this wallet is the one item that always ends up getting shuffled around in it so i tried two very compact hakuba cases for two cf cards each which i acquired in adorama
these are working far better as they are small enough to fit anywhere in the camera bag and i can clip them to the camera strap or belt strapif you dont have a space issue this tamrac wallet should work well for you
if you do i suggest looking for other solutionsthis wallet does what i need hold memory cardsunfortunately the clip on the back which allows it to attach to a belt or sliplock loop as on lowepro bags is not super secure
the button snap comes apart easily and the velcro is not as strong as it should bethe pockets are different sizes and the smaller ones are a very tight fit for a compactflash card in its plastic casea few small changes to the design of this product would make it absolutely perfectchanging the compartments inside is more difficult than indicated and space is at a premiumive had my velocity  for about  months and while its still looks pristine ive gotten a fair amount of use from it
i disagree that its too small but then i have a canon xti which isnt the biggest dslr out there
that fits nicely in the center with the  zoom between a  and the mm
theres even room for a gallon ziplock bag and a microtripodpros decent amount of space good separators for the main compartment with velcro to customize to your needs protects your gear so long as your reasonably careful easy to get to and not bad for pulling out your cameraconsthe reason i recommend the x instead of this model is that the top flap on this opens towards you
the x opens away from you so the lid isnt in the way of getting in the main compartmentneck strap broke at seam about the forth time i used it
binoculars are ok  the price was low alsothere are a lot of nice things about this camera that are mentioned in the other reviews
i just want to alert you of some of the drawbacks that lead me to give it three stars
the autofocus is slow and there is significant delay from when you push the button to when the photo is taken
pictures of things in motion come out blurry
for example i took the camera to the park with my children and photos of them on the slide swing etc
all came out blurry
the battery dosent last very long if you use the lcd display and the flash
if you buy the camera you should get the extra battery
if you are using the flash it takes about  seconds for the flash to recharge between picturesthese might seem like small things but ive been using the camera to take pictures of my children and it seems like i miss the nice shots because the camera hasnt focused or im waiting for the flash to recharge or my kids look away between the time that i push the button and the picture is actually takenyou cant beat the price but if you are plugging your computer into your home theater sound system you will hear a noise that is a hum at a lower volume than what i found after buying a better cable that is sheilded for just a little more moneyprotechgroup professional grade  ft mm stereo male to rca male awg cable  gold plated connectorsdecided to replace y audio with hdmi cable so really cant rate this product
i am sure anything belkin would be a good choiceit was exactly what i needed and very sturdy
great for what i need and the best part is it workedi connected this cable between a mini hi fi  and a tv
i got some sound alright but there was a considerable  amount of humming which again is  ok at  lower volumes but  the humming gets amplified greatly when the volume gets  turned up to loud levels
this might  probably due to the cable not being shielded properly which in turn would  definetly result in a deterioration of the sound quality and furthermore  would  never reproduce sound accurately  if either end of the cable is connected to a device with amplificationdont buy it if you dont need touse a hdmi cable insteadits up to you but i made a mistake buying it i have no use for itit okay so far the purpose that i bought it for will not work the laptop seen to use the mm plug  pole thati have not really used it yet but tried it out and work ok just need it for extending my audio connectionworkeddoent sound too good thoughdont know whybut it doesnt what it supposed to doim not doing a cartwheel over itaw see my handset review
i have had similar cords in the past and remember my daughter cleaning shelves of nicknacks as he talked to her friends   cordless phones get away from that hazzard
lolextends across the kitchen about  ftbegins to get a little tight
isnt stretched out or anything yet as welli like the product but the pb issue or warning says higher than some standardi dont know why it would have lead on it
says in the wires
i didnt see no need for soldermany products should be rohs by now
lead freei dont even know why lead would need to be used on a phone cordkeep in mind that this is  feet long if you pull on the cord enough to stretch it out that far
but then the phone starts to come your waythe length is  feet
however i find the cord tangles and result  out of shape
other than that the cord works wellexactly as described on the ad
i bought this cable it with the att  phone that is very poor quality to say the least
but the cable seems to worki bought this for my office because my old cord kept tangling up on me
i also wanted a longer one
the length on this one is great but it tangles up just the same as the old one did
i wish i could find one that does not tangle
it is a paingreat splitter does the jobthis device does what it says it will do
i returned home to find it irreparably damaged but discovered it was my older brothers mistake
easily replaced for just a dollar or twonot a whole lot to say here
bought an electronics accessory it does its job
construction is solid sound quality is good
well doneupdate after only a few uses over the course of about a year the soldered connections are beginning to give out and sound quality can be pretty bad
you have to play the fidgeting with the wire game all the time which is really annoying
i usually like belkin for these type of things so maybe i just got a bad one
but be warythey sent the wrong size and it wont work with my ipad so no way to tell if works well or notthis is the best splitter ive used saying that i constantly have to keep the headphone jack just right in the inputs or the sound is offthe price should maybe be lower because the wires seem just average
some days i have to wiggle the jack for a second to get one side to work
but it is not that annoying and it might be the computer jacks fault in which case i would say  stars not  ild buy it again just cause i did not see a better made one in the short time i looked on amazonthis product works as advertized but the plug wont fit into my iphone with the case on
i had to trip some of the rubber around the plug so it would fit into my iphone and ipad with the cases on
also keep in mind that the iphone and ipad have  conductor jacks so they can use headphones wih the volume controls
this adapter works but you have to pull it out slightly to hear audio in both lr sides
i dont recommend this for apple productsarrived fast but one of the outputs doesnt work really well
you have to tinker with it until you hear somethingi gave this  stars but its kind of my fault
i have a pair of headphones that has a microphone and a speaker connector both male mm
i thought this would let me plug the mic into one female connector the speaker into the other and then connect them into my laptops single audio port
nope
this is chiefly an audio splitter
if you want to connect two pairs of headphones for some reason that doesnt make any sense this is your guyso far the splitter works but the connection to the radio is loose
if someone bumps into it it falls out
sometimes i tape it on
as far as the sound goes the music loses a little quality but for my purposes its good enough
two kids can listen to one radioonly purchased this item being the panasonic headset i ordered from amazon didnt show or i missed it that the headset came with a speaker and headphone splitter
now i have this one i will probably never use
hey you win some and you lose some my father always  told methese do work but are a bit thick so dont work well with my phone cases so i have to use a cord extension to make it work
it took a long time for this to send and did not get here in the eta window
all in all i will be using these but my advice is pick some up at walmart or a convenient marti was looking for an adapter that split the stereo signal into two separate monaural signals
ive since learned that the description for what i want usually refers to tip and ring outputs  those types of splitters are hard to findthe description led me to believe it was what i wanted but i should have read it more carefully
as a stereo splitter for attaching two headphones i suppose it would be finethe intended reason for the purchase did not work out however  was cheap enough that i didnt have to return and found uses for itneed to make sure you push both head phone jacks in hard
may need to turn and rotate jacks to get full volumei finally tried it when my cousin and i wanted to hear the game i was playing when everyone else were talking loud
although there were some loss audio in terms of volume but i think it can be tweaked to have both in its own individualized sound
also we used it on the computer and thats because i play my ps on an p hd monitor connected to my emachines computer
i bought an amazon basics hdmi to dvi cable to make it happen
anywho sound can be diverted in so many ways when its connected to a computer i didnt have time to figure out how to have us our own sound volume and preventing the loss in sound volume
all in all this is a great cheap device and if anyone is looking for a good headphone splitter you should get thisbought this before a couple transatlantic flights and was a little disappointed
the volume drop was very noticeable possibly heightened by a noisy airplane cabin and the connection had to be held in place for it to even work
rendered bose headphones into cheap ear budsthe sound in both headphones is ok  but i must turn the plug many times to adjust the volumesince the day one the product it is not working well
i need to keep on adjusting one connector to listen to the sound
i bought this especially to watch movies by me and my wife so that my son wont get disturbed when he is sleepingmy both of the headphones are from sony  apple and they work superb when iuse them independentlyoverall i could say i am not much satisfied with this producti bought this cable for a recent trip so my wife and i could both listen to movies through our headphones on our galaxy tab
we initially had some trouble getting the cable to work properly
at first my wife would hear music while i would hear the voices
after playing with the cable for a little bit it ended up working and we were really grateful that we bought itoverall simple and good but after a few hours of use the right channel of one of two connectors stopped workingmaybe i was just unlucky
otherwise its small flexible and practical
sound quality not affectedthe adapter works but not perfect
everything plugs in tight and there is a signal but the connection is not 
the main line works well but the splitter plugs for the headphones have a crappy connection
once plugged in the headphone plugs would have to be rotated within the connector to achieve a good sound signal
otherwise the sound is not clear and somewhat tuned down
when you find the perfect position the signal is good
works and cheap but i expected betteri used in for a laptop watching a movie on a plane
would have been happier if the connection worked wellthe packaging does say belkin but sometimes i question these cheap products which are in many cases counterfeit fakesthere is not much to say about this except that it works okay
quality is not great
we get what we pay forgot this to allow  kids to use their headsets for mobile viewing of tablet
sometimes mommy needs quiet time so kids get ipad video time
previous hack of one ear bud per person was not working especially for stereo productions like movies
that hack also forced too much unappreciated physical togetherness
this splitter works greatthe connections arent the best  you have to jiggle them a bit sometimes to get the sound to come through on both channelswhat its advertised to do
i got these to hook up duel headsets to a ps and they work well for thisthis is a jack splitter works fine and though i do have a use for this thus the  stars this is not what i intended when i ordered itwhat i was looking for was a mm to rca stereo female cable which is what the picture details this is not one of those this is merely a jack splitter which in itself is fine however if your like me and arent overly experienced in tech terminologies you might look at the picture and purchase the wrong product like i did so be aware of what this isthe product is  stars however amazon gets  star for not showing the actual product and thus the  starsstrange sounds come from this thing no idea why that is
the cables seem to have no interference protection insidei used this to split the audio from my ipad so my wife and i could watch a movie on the plane
i needed to gently twirl the connectors until we both got sound
i barely got it to work
this is going into the trash and i am going to find something else for our next tripthis splitter works fine but be aware it wont fit if you ned a slim plug to fit in your iphone case or recessed jackthe product delivers the appropriate output from my hosting unit to my two separate speaker systems
however once the two output sources are both connected to this unit a buzzing sound from both speaker sets occurs
if just one of the speaker sets is attached to the splitter the buzzing goes awayas an amateur i cannot say whether this experience is to be expected from a splitter or not
all that i can say is that i did not expect a sideeffect of a splitter being that the two output sources would have a buzzing sound
i assumed that the sound quality would still be preserved
will be trying a different splitter httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdiesu to see if that corrects the problemand to be clear the unit does not split my audio into a rightleft like other commenter have suggested
my only complaint is the buzzing noisei purchased this to replace the much too short cord on the new telephone
it is purported to be  ft long only if two able bodied people can apply enough tension to stretch it to its full length
all other aspects are satisfactory
the price was low and shipping relatively fast for us snail maili read the reviews not a bad product but my choices were keep the   feet at initial stress foot panasonic original cord  feet  feetthis one starts to stress at  feet maybe and is pulling the phone around at  feeti gave it  stars since its probably my fault for not believing the reviewsthis cord works fine however the  feet advertisement is a bit misleading
maybe if you were able to uncurl the cord it would stretch to  feet
the curls reduce the length to maybe  feet
that isnt what i was looking for so id like to have seen a clearer description of the lengthi wish i had paid attention to the one review titled when  feet is more like  feet  that sums it up perfectly
it does not feel like  feet at all
or even half that length
the only way you could get  feet out of this is if you stretched it to the point where its completely straight and no longer curls
that said the sound quality is greati needed a new telephone handset cord and purchased this one based on some positive reviews
my previous cord was knotted and twisted and got to the point where i couldnt get it detangledwas hoping this cord might be different and not have the knotting and twisting problems most cords do
its definitely a well made cord but after a few weeks i found it slowly starting to knot and twistcomes with the territory i guess was just hoping to get lucky and find a cord that would hold up better than most
this is a decent cord but i will probably end up replacing it soonit was cheap and it worked and that is all i could ask
a little long for my use but thats okgreat but i ordered not long enough   my applicationrereordered  ft works well for mei would recommend these cat  wirethis adapter fit my game steering wheel controller and usb on my pc but windows xp did not recognize the controller which is the only reason i purchased this item
it may work with a different controller but my logitech wingman gamer steering wheel controller
maybe with an install disk it might workdidnt work for me but may work for others
did not successfully adapt the device as intended
fits the junk box of new and used useless electronic castoffs just fine howeverthe adapter does not jumper pin  to pin  to allow recognition on windows as a digital device
to do that remove the bottom of the sidewinder joystick
there will be screws under the pads on the bottom
pry pads off with a sharp knife
be carefulto remove the pc board to get to the wires remove the two small screws near the chip and a larger screw off to the opposite side
do not remove the  screws arranged in a square
that will have the joystick parts everywhereonce you can get to the cord wires use a soldering iron to melt the insulation off of the dark blue and purple wires above the connector
they are next to each other so solder the two together
then plug the joystick into the adapter and the usb into the pc
my xp recognized it theni like the length of this plug but when i move around a little bit i get a lot of static
i keep it plugged in to my work computer and i dont move much so for the most part it works fine
the cable seems to be of decent quality and it certainly is thick enough
overall i would recommend this extension for the price if you are not an audiophile and just want to add some length to your headphonesim going to admit up front that i probably abused this cable
i wrapped the female end around a bar on the treadmill to keep it in place
now ive got sketchy performance when listening through headphones  the left and right alternately cut out depending on how i bend the cable end
i now have to bend the cable end and i have to do it in just the right way or else i get just right left or nothingso be careful how you handle this cable
ive certainly learned my lesson for the next cablegot this cable today
the cable has no mention of belkin anywhere on it
in fact there is nothing written anywhere on it
works fine for now thoughproduct was delivered quickly and efficiently
it came in a plastic bag with a made in china label
has no discernible belkin label anywhere
it may well be a belkin product but there is nothing that would lead you to believe it really is there is no labeling on the cable there is no labeling on the package
the item does as it promises  provides you with a  cable that does work
usually there is some tellnot here
it is possible belkin sells bulk cables to other manufacturers it is possible this company may package cabling for belkin sale and this might be that cable i paid a bit more because i like knowing i am getting the product advertised but there isnt much to confirm that in this casemy drive has to have power to all pins
this one as you can see in the picture does not cover all the pins
it may work with an additional lead for the power input if you can find one that will fit in there
i did not try
plus side i called the seller and told them this i was told no problem they credited me for it
did not even have to returni would recommend this company hard to find one that backs up the orderi ordered an assortment of   and  foot cables to connect  gigabit switches and half dozen pcs and two servers
i had been using older cat e and felt it was time to refresh the cables
i have tested the cables using my applications and they are performing as well as the e cables were doing
the limit is in the applications not the cablesi did notice that i was cussing while disconnecting the older cables
you know the ones with the little nubbin that refuses to disconnect
i smiled as i connected the snagless cables
everything works as expected and i am a happy camper
i have ordered another  cables to round out my refreshprices are right
performance is greatoh and im cussing lessupdate   months lateri may have cussed less after threading these cables through my racks but  months later im ready to replace them
they dont snag but after  months that little nubbin doesnt release anymore on several of the cables
not all but enough so that id not use this manufacturer againi hate it if it didnt work
but it does work and was just the right length that i neededi got the  feet of cable  it came in a bag
it says cat and is  feet long and has the ctg snagless feature
however i thought these cables are made in the usa
the bag i have doesnt say cablestogo anywhere and it says made in china
this is a christmas gift  hope the thing works
go to ctgs website and they state all products made in the usaproscolorsnagless featurecatconsauthentici changed it out and got faster speeds on my network but its ok and i will keep it as a backuptoo lazy to go out and put one up
this served its purpose
the color help identify what connection its forthis is a review of the seller only not the product
that is some good stuffamazons quality has always been good and trusted
rd party sellers are a mix and most cant be trusted to get quality brand products
this time amazon let my down  of my cables were correctly branded
the third was not
it looks the same but is made from a cheaper manufacturer
all  were placed in the same order
the rd cable even has a different sku stickeri got a real cables to go product from amazon but the ends on this cable are loose so you may need to crimp it down the roadthe cable is good for short range network assembly
definitely better that a cat  or e
i used it between my modem and routerits a cable  it works
nicely molded connector and secure latch clip
well made and a good value
what else to sayit works on all of my machines except for the one running vista
i could not find any compatible drivers
other than that it works great on my xp machine
maybe i should stop using devices that require a com porti use this adapter to connect my laptop compaq presario with window xp with a garmin etrex vista gps
a small problem it only works with the mapsource software but not with microsoft streets  trips
microsoft streets  trips just wont find the gps with any communication protocol including nmea and rtcm
it is not a problem for me because i purchased the mapsource software
for poeple who wish to use microsofts map mostly for free mine come with my new pc you have to try with some other combinationthe first thing i had to do when i received this in the mail was measure the length of the cord due to my curious nature since all the other similar cables come in at only  ft the result was it measures somewhere around  ft but not even close to   ft as advertised
some might feel this is minor nitpicking but still i and a few others apparently after reading similar reviews dont appreciate being deceived
for my needs the cable itself worked fine though
i use it to charge and use my ps controller for my desktop pc where its hooked up behind the back of the tower
so for me the extra  inches wouldve been appreciated since i felt a  ft cord was too long stars off for the false advertisingi bought this cable to replace a misplaced garmin nuve  gps data cableas an aside my canon powershot s digital camera data cable works fine as a substitute cable for my garminthe cable under review is advertised to work with the canon s cameraand it does
however it will not work with the garmin gps as a data cable
go figure
it appears you can charge the garmin while plugged into a usb port with this cable but it will not connect to the computer for data transferquality of the cable is finemost people would not buy these cables for the reason i did i was trying to find a longer usb cable to use with my gps unit in the car and with my usb adaptors that i have for my power source
if you are trying to do something similar fyi this cable will work on your computer but my gps unit kept saying that usb connection found  but would not charge
i just used the old cable i am sure ill find a use for these at some pointi bought this for a digital frame to download images  then realized its the exact same cord my ps uses to recharge controllers  oh welli was a little disappointed i had a few cables with loose ends and a couple of cable ends that had a rusty look
not sure i will purchase these cables thru here againi needed this cable for my mio gps
i think mio should have included it as an accessory in the box but i guess they didnt feel it was necessary
so anyway i ordered two of these cables from the seller clearav
delivery was ok i received the cables a week after placing my order
but the cable is not ft long despite what it says on the package
the actual length is  inches
i dont know if youll get the same cables if you order from a different seller
nevertheless i used the cable to hook up my gps to my computer and it worked fine
my gps charged up nicely and transferred files with no problems
so i guess im ok with themes un buen producto aunque podria mejorar en la calidad de los materiales cumple con lo necesario de uso aunque con el tiempo el plastico junto a los conectores comienza a presentar desgastecheap cable but it works
not very durable
i used this for an outdoor installation and havent had any issues yet
if i were to do it again i would get something with a thicker shellpositives first  the cable was well packed and easy to pull from the box
sturdy cable for standard wiringnegatives  the plastic on the individual wires is rough and if you will be working with this all day youll find your fingertips raw
the individual wires are also very stiff and hard to manipulatewhat could it go wrong 
all i want is store cd and protect wont get scratch thats all i ask fornot very well built
the plastic is very flimsy but i guess ill live with it
ill look elsewhere for better productabout six of the cases were cracked when i opened up the package
not sure if this is an unfortuate shipping issue or if they were originally shipped that way
otherwise the rest of the cases were fine and for the price it was still worth itnot that they are any different than other slimline cases but these cases are cheaply made and fragile
they are effective in protecting disks against scratching and shortterm transportation needstwo of the cases arrived broken
the packaging air bags did not prevent the contents from rattling around and damaging several cases
the rest of the cases are fine
the quality is not the best but it dos the jobthe first set that arrived there were  of them broken set them back and got a replacementfor what i need these will work finethe little tabs on the hings  break off real easyfive of the  cases arrived broken
the packaging air bags did not prevent the contents from rattling around and damaging several cases
the remain cases are finethe verbatim dc storage cases are okay
they do not have the quality of the hp branded cases that i had before
on the plus slide they are in assorted colors the hp cases were black and cleari needed to backup my new computer and create some discs so i got these figuring that i could make copies of things i had put off doing
they are nice thin cases in a variety of colors
i am not pleased because they have no title  papersor whatever you call them to show what the disc has on it
obviously this isnt my strong point
it never occurred to me that they wouldnt but then i havent bought cases before because i always bought the cddvds in cases
live and learnthese cases are ok if theyre not broken during shipment
the manufacturer wraps the product in bubble wrap which doesnt protect the cases on either end of the package from being destroyed  in my case two deep
unfortunately amazons packaging doesnt take this into account
my shipment had  of the cases destroyed during shipment
ive never had this happen with the black cases which i also buythese are nice take up little room when you need to store a bunch of them but they do open easily dumping discs out in your bag briefcase etc also i have ordered literally hundreds of these and each time i recieve them no matter how well protected theyre are usually anywhere from three to seven broken ones in the bunch from the jostling around they take during shippingthey are cheaply made  often break just using them in a normal manner but what isnt these daysthey hold the cds  dvds  i guess thats what counts in the endi wish there was another manufacture making these but there does not seem to be manymost of the time i had very good luck with amazon but the last order of these cases there were too many broken cases
six of the first  were broke
i have not examined the other  cases
the discount on the amazon warehouse price is not that much less than the new cases
in the future i will buy only new boxes of dvd storage casesnice price for these
when i opened the box up i found that one of the cases was brokenit is kind of flimsy for the price is not a biggie but it does the job so i probably recommendthese are budget but good enough quality cases at a good price
pleased with this purchase
just what i neededim getting a bit of ghosting on text that makes it unpleasant to read
my eyesight is poor enough that if im sitting back from the screen and watching a movie in hd it doesnt seem too bad but im not happy with the ghostingin my past ive specified many cabling jobs and researched all of the ingredients required for a good jobyou can use the best cable switches etc
but if you have a crappy plug you have compromised the entire job
ive seen it and it makes no sense to skimp on any one part of a good cabling jobi always used amp part number its for a solid never use stranded copper cat and above cable and whether the job specified all  wires or not i always specified that all  wires be terminated tsb because thats what the plugs crimp strain relief was designed foralso dont just pick up your crimper and assume its ok test it
ive seen contractors use the same dye for years and the teeth wear down
they fail their cable test with a definite pattern across all closets and the last place they look is their crimp tools
ethernet is somewhat forgiving but always go for the best you can getuse a good crimp tool and dye designed for that crimp tool
i always specified amp because i wanted to be consistent across the plug crimp tool and dye
contractors used to crap their pants when they read in my rfps that i was specifying the crimp tools dyes and plugs and cable testing tools but you have to if you want the best consistent resultswhatever
do your homework find a good system and move on to the next level of cablingwas sent package repackaging from bulk maybe
the sticker on the bag said rohs compliantsilly because all thats in here is copper and plastic but theres nothing to indicate they are tripplite
made in china on the bag toothey do seem to be good quality and ive only terminated one cable and one crossover cable so far
theres just nothing to say these are tripplite and the generics are slightly cheaper
i got these for my job otherwise i wouldnt careused this for more hard drive power connections for my file server pretty simple and it worked for my applicationnothing to write home to mother about
it does the job its supposed to without the fanfare and high pricethe cable works fine but it is impossible to get the end out after it is stuck into a piece of equipment
i was certain i was going to break something the first time it was removednow i carefully hold and brace whatever the cable is stuck in like a router and have to jigger the cable head back and forth until it suddenly releases and pops out with a jerki would not buy this cable again
i just know i am going to break the router trying to get this cable out of itthese are quite flimsy
they do work for your cds or dvds but they do not close very well and have a cheap feel to them
i would recommend against these is you are getting into the case oftenconsidering that youre getting  plastic cases for about  this purchase is a real bargain
as far as i was able to tell none of the cases were cracked when they arrived due to ample air bubble cushioning in the outer shipping container
as an avid photographer who puts all his travelogues and other photos on dvds and cds i didnt want to spend an arm and a leg on protecting my entire collection present and future so these cases are just fine
theyre nothing fancy but quite adequate for their intended purposedoes what is supposed to do
at every connectdisconnect it feels like it is going to fall aparti tried it with a kvm in a unit that has only one ps port and a kvm that wants  it would recognize either the keyboard or the mouse never both
its probably the fault of the kvm but perhaps manufacturers shouldnt imply that these are foolproof
they arenti purchased two didnt work for either one  in box to be shipped back to amazon for a refund
too bad i wanted it to work look like ok qualitywas for my new mb with one combo ps port
one of the ports on the splitter works with either mouse or keyboard but not the other  couldnt get both keyboard and mouse working at the same time
had different keyboards and mice around my office but no combinations had worked including reversing the ports purple to green and green to purple
also few combinations locked my windows  computer  soft or a hard reset didnt work and couldnt get the computer running needed to unplug the power cord
back to usb for the mouse and ps for the keyboardthis solution did not work for me
i employ a kvm switch to switch back and forth between my two computers and ps connectors are required
my asus pzv le plus motherboard has a combo ps connector but when i connected the keyboard and mouse via this splitter they were not recognized
luckily this item was inexpensive so i shelved it
my solution was to install a syba sdpciups usb to dual ps adapter case mounted version and connect the two ps connectors from my kvm switch to it
it turned out to be a cleaner connection in the back of my midtower anywayit didnt protrude as far back and provided less clutternot a constant picture  looks like a breeze is running through my display depending on the hour
but the resolution is otherwise good
will be buying a shielded hd vga cable nexti ordered two of these startech feet coax high resolution vga monitor cables
i use them to connect my desktop pc to my lcd pcmonitor with the resolution set at  x  pixels
one works fine the other doesnt
with the bad one the graphics exhibit ghost images
when i connected this bad one to another monitor i got even worse result  the display was very dim and reddish
wriggling it didnt help
one or more pins were not making connections
the picture of the cable in this web page is inaccurate
it depicts connectors with only pins and pin  missing
the actual cable i received has all  pins including pin 
see my uploaded image
it is actually a good thing that this cable has all pins because some lcd and plasma tv monitors will not work without pin  see my comment below for further explanation
the cables look solidly constructed and the price is very reasonable
however due to one defective cable out of two in the same order i only recommend this vga cable to amazon shoppers with reservation
of course you can always return it within a month if it turns out to be defectivethis product works decent enough but i find it to be very bulky compared to other similar products i have usedworks fine for the computer monitor i have
nothing special about the chord and have not had any issues with it yetso far does what it is suppose to do
the quality does not seem to be excellent but as long as it worksi gought this cable to connect my computer to my tv
it is been working fine
i was expecting it to be black but it came out grey not a big deal but now stands out from the other cables that i have plugged into the tvthe image was misleading
i actually wanted black cords but instead they were white
not a big deal because they work properly and they were shipped to me on time but i think they should make the buyers aware that the picture is not exactthis cable works fine as long as you get it in just right
it seems a little loosehooking up my laptop to my hdtv with these vga cables there was a little bit of ghosting
it wasnt as bad as ive seen with other comparable cables but it wasnt the best either
considering the cost its about averagei have had to unscrew and screw this wire back in numerous times it keeps slipping out of position and effecting the soundpicture quality
its not that much of an inconvenience but the fact it wont just stay in place is a bit of a painthis cable is good made
have a very nice structure an lenght too
it came to my house on timethanksi have a lcd tv and a lcd pc monitor that i connect my laptop to on a regular basis
i needed a basic vga cable and this gets the job done
the cable is relatively thick but isnt an issue for mei ordered this cable in august
the seller did send it out relatively quickly however the us post office near washington dc had it in their facility for five days i know this because i tracked it being logged in at that facility every day
lousy usps service on thisin order to ensure correct color when connecting my pc to my  tv i must move the cable around a bit and somehow keep it in a certain position
it seems that the module that is located close to one end of the cable is affecting the signal
kind of a hassle but it does work and the video quality is ok
when i get the cable in just the right position
and yes the connections are tightwould i buy it again
yes because the length is good the cable is heavy and i can get it to work
for the price cant do betteri cant really rate this
i ordered it in error where as i should have ordered a vga to hdmid cable
although the delivery was greatproduct is what i expected
the software that came with it had to be upgraded from the website
i still have not gotten it to workjuly  do not purchase this item
it never worked
after more research found out it was a cheap chinese imitationunfortunately i could not use it
the hard drive went wrong
so i can not say much about
i did not had the opportunity to fully tested but good to have in a door in case the opportunity presents itself againcable converters
they do what they say they do
nothing more nothing less
i dont even use
they came with some thing elseitems are allot bigger then they appear making monitor adapting very hard
ended having to buy and extension cable to use thesethe concept is good but the execution is just a bit offthe plastic shield that cover the wires to the adapters move too much they go so far down that it gets to be problematic to fit the adapter onto the driveit may be a simple product but it could have been perfect with a slight redesignalthough the b end of the cable did not fit as snugly into my microphone as the original shorter cord that came with microphone does and this cable had a tendency to want to fall out upon initially plugging it in it still has good signal quality and did not result in any static or any noticeable unwanted background noise to occur
a little work on the b end of the cable with a pair of pliers to correct the shape of the plug and everything is just about as it should be so ill give the cable partial marksgood cord but doesnt fit in nicely with my epson printer in picture the color shown is black but they delivered me a white onei ordered two an one was bad
however at this price i guess thats to be expected
its still better than paying x as much at a brick and mortari use this tape with a dymo letra tag
the print looks good
i have not had any problems with ink smearing or anything
the label looks when it is cut from the label machine
although the paper backing is extremely hard to remove
the backing needs to be perforated or something to make it easier to apply a labelif you have a dymo letratag you pretty much have to buy their brand of tape
its a bit pricey per inch
for anything exposed to sunlight even indirect sunlight either the black will fade or the white will turn brown or both within  yearson the good side the sleeve material is sturdy
it is easy to slide the label into its pocket in the tab on top of the sleeve you dont need a black plastic insertion tool like you do with other brands
on the bad side the fit is just too snug
the cd or dvd will never fall out but it takes some force to get it in and out
the booklet doesnt fit flat unless you trim about an eighth of an inch off the right side of it
the pictures in the listing make it look like the cd fits loosely and the booklet fits fine not so
i have upload some photos that i took to show you that the fit is too snugi was happy that i received the order quickly
i didnt think to check the box right away
i was in the middle of finishing a batch of cds for a band that had recorded in my studio
when i opened the box to insert the cd booklets and cds i found that i had been shipped regular cd jewel cases and not the slimline cases that i had ordered
since i was on a time table and didnt have time to send them back and get the right jewel cases i had to make do
unfortunately that included extra work for myself since i now had to make tray cards for the jewel cases
my fault for not checking but how do you mistake the slim line cases for regular jewel cases in packing them for shipping
thats why im giving  starsthese are ok but very poorly made
the break just opening them
heaven help you if actually drop one then its toast
pay a little more and get some that are more durablesame quality as any other cd case
i needed these because when i buy blanks i get them by the spindlehave gone through  of the cases so far and found one to have a broken hinge
not a good percentage ratethis display isnt compatible with current powerbooks
an expensive adapter is requiredsame adapter is required for any industry standard dvi portthis would be a great product especially for the price but it does not offer keyboard based switching
most of these port switchers allow you to press some key combination like scrolllock twice to switch
but this one only works with the frontpanel buttons
this is very inconvienent and a deal killer for me
be forewarned
if you do not mind having to push a button on a box it is finethis kvm switch is very well built
i switch it between windows and linux machines without issuecaveat the unit only switches using the front panel buttons
it does not support a hotkey sequence
the manufacturers website incorrectly represents this
if this feature is significant to you like it was for us you need to purchase the ur and not the ur or urkit
very easytoconfuse part numbering doesnt improve my opinion of this manufactureranother item to keep in mind about this device whenever you switch pcs it emulates plugging and unplugging of your keyboard  mouse
doing this repeatedly can cause instability in some less mature usb stacks
the ur doesnt do this it emulates an idle mouse  keyboard for all the other pcsthis device is actually manufactured by a company called atenthe initial drivers did have many problems however i was finally able to get the product to work on windows xp
i down loaded the make floppy driver for xp from the manufactures website
next download the most recent windows  driver and try and install it yes you have to download two separate drivers
the windows  driver will prompt you for a file it can not locate point to your floppy drive location of xp driver and it will install the xp driver
if you check device manager you will first see a question mark prior to the install after the install windows recognizes the device without a problem
you can even go into advaced properties and then change the com port number to a lower number then  the default
it does seem strange that they dont have a simple fix for this but at least i found a work aroundiogear has always filled a market nitch of specialized computing products so ive come to not expect a lot of support but all the products generally work and are of good bulid quality they dont fall apartcheap and ok just a plastic case what can it go wrong 
it store cd and protect it without get scratchthese memorex cddvd sleeves work as expected to hold cddvd media but as others have noted the rubber band used to package the sleeves significantly wrinkled the clear plastic window that shows the image printed on the disc
ordinarily this would not be a problem for most uses but we professionally produce instructional and promotional videos that we bulk distribute in similar sleeves
unfortunately we ran out at the end of a production run so needed a few extra to finish the job so i ended up buying two packs of these locally and went through them to find fifty that were not too badly distorted to use for our customer the rest we will use for our own discs in our shopotherwise these are decent enough quality for daily usecfhso i have been buying these sleeves for a few years now
in the beginning they were great
the last couple of orders though and i tend to buy  boxes at a time the quality is not therewhat i mean here is that there is a little catch tab to hold the flap
not an overlay difficult thing to design in and make yet for the last few orders now the half inch or so of available tab catching range only catches maybe  of an inch of the flap meaning it doesnt hold it it pops out
such a simple thing that they just cant seem to get righti bought these cases and when i received them  of them were broken
i dont buy blank cases too often but i have bought delicate things before and this is the first and only item i have received from amazon that did
in all im not disappointed i looked at other reviews and a few of them said the same thing and i thought it wouldnt happen to me
as for the ease of opening i have not had that problem
they open easily and close securely for meabout  or so were broken towards the middle of the pack
annoying
but they do well in distributing product to clientsthese are ok slim jewel cases but they are pretty flimsy and not strong
i used them to distribute a number of promotional dvds and they were fine for that purpose
they are really not appropriate for any kind of permanent storagei seriously question if these are memorex jewel cases the jewel cases did not arrive in a memorex box as in the illustration
they had been bulkpacked in a plain cardboard box
the name memorex was nowhere to be found on the box and there was no indication that these jewel cases were memorex
i have a box of  memorex jewel cases i previously purchased at an office supply store and there are differences between these and the jewel cases that arrived in this order
also the product number on the cardboard box is not the same number as on the memorex box i bought at the storeother than that they seem to be about the same qualitya classic example of you get what you pay for
inexpensive but very breakable
i would not buy this brand again but at about  cents a piece i guess i should not have expected much quality or durabilitythe cases are fine but extremly fragile even if dropped on capet they breakso if you drop them on the floor or any hard surface forget it its gone
i estimate about  to   you may break
i dont see anything else better on the market so you just have to deal with it
oh i will buy this product againbought quantity  of these packs and out of each box there were three cracked cases
bad packagingspeaking of packaging both boxes came in a plain brown cardboard box looked nothing like the fancy photo shown with the product adthey are thin and maybe a bit flimsy but for the price they worked for meafter using these they are fine but i ordered the memorex jewel cases as pictured and that is not what i received
i received  cases in a brown box with no manufacturer
be wary of fantasybuywe bought two packs of these for our wedding
our favor was a mixed cd chosen by the wedding party
the price was goodthe packs arrived fine and there wasnt any damage per se that amazon would have been responsible for
it was just upon opening and using them that we found maybe  total over both packs that had cracks and breaks in the spin and cover hinge clearly from their initial packaging
that was okay but the bigger problem for me was that a lot of them had imperfections  streaks dots something or other in the plastic
nothing huge and nothing you would care about for your own use so if youre buying these for your own cds really theyll be fine
but for wedding favors they looked bad
another  or so over both packs were unusable in that regardyou get what you pay for and these were cheap usable and fine
just not your best option for presentationof the  jewel cases in the package  was crackbut still useable
but im sure that it will brakeafter a couple of times of open  closing of the casei just did not want to take the time to return thepackage so i just through it awaywell i was somewhat happy because it came well preserved no cracked jewels cases from other buyers
i was looking for clear all over and another brand but amazon did not have others instead this brand
i did see other sellers but i like to buy directly and sold by amazon in case theres a problemmy reason not giving it a  star is as followedi wanted cystal clear trays front and bottommore importantly these cases contain label warning saying contaims a chemical lead that can cause cancer according california state law
my concerns are due you wash your hands after handling the cases
if i was you yes these avoids paranoia when trying to have contact with food
i know we dont live in a perfect world
its impossible so i learn to live with it and get use to it
i supposefyi tried to use this product as a usb  port for a mac powerbook g running leopard 
the card worked fine for keyboards mice and ipod syncing but it did not work for iphone syncing
it would frequently cause kernel panics and require manual powercycling to reboot the maci tried a few different ways to get it to work including using the drivers builtin to leopard and then using the latest  drivers from the iogear website but ultimately was forced to give upnote that i also tried a belkin product and was similarly unsuccessfuli guess if you are going for an older camera to save money this isnt a bad choice but i would recommend looking at newer ones
like most electronic gadgets they get better every yearpros generally easy to use uses standard aa batteries no lens cap to lose software  easy web page publishing in professional versioncons a little too big to be pocketable there are comparable cameras with x and even x optical zoom no stabilization feature lacks shutterpriority aperaturepriority and manual modes difficult to impossible to get good pictures of indoor sporting events and other lowlight situations where the flash does no good or you cant use the flash actually this is probably true of many other consumerlevel cameras slow reaction time  push the button and it takes the picture about a second later or not at all if it thinks you need the flash menus arent explained very well in the manual software  version that comes with the camera is crippled but the professional version freezes occasionallydespite what somebody else said backing up files to a cd isnt that hard if you know what you are doing you just have to mount the cd so it looks like any other disk drive
i had no problems with thisanyway id say spend a little more money and get a panasonic with x zoom image stabilization and some of the other features mentioned above
you could also go for a camera with higher mp but id rather spend my money on features that will actually help me take better pictures not just bigger onesi shall say that overall this camera performs well
my main complaint is that the pictures taken in low light with or without flash tend to have excessive noises ie
tiny color dots all over
however under ample sunlight the problem does not seem to exist
also i noticed that the camera does not produce as sharp pictures as my brothers nikon digital does
it does not degrade to the extent of defectiveness but there certainly is more to be desiredthere is really not a whole lot of positive i can say about this thing
it works as it should the cord is long and the price is good
thats about all the good i can think of
it fulfills its life as a surge protector
however there is nothing great about this product
it is way too fat and the cord is too thick and unwieldy
not good qualities for a surge protector that is going to be out in the open
the plug is a standard plug not a flat one why do they still do that
combine that with a thick cord and it becomes very hard to have it be plugged into a tough to access outlet
also all but one of the outlets are right next to each other so do not think about using it for something that has big bulky plugswould i buy it again no
i would pay a tad bit more and get something that is much more usefulthe outlet is good quality but short
the cord is two foot
the outlet the cord  ftbelkin usually has a good product and this one is despite my  stars
my complaint is that with the size of electric plugs i can only get  of them on this plug surge protector
i mostly got it for the onoff switchafter reading other reviews i decided to purchase  of these
when they arrived  was defective  the ground light did not work and i had to return it
generally i do not think they are as well made as some other reviews state
a couple of the inputs feel like there is not a good contact when the plug is inserted
however i am replacing the defective one and keeping the other because i like the protection warranties and i hope once in place in my home they will do the jobthe surge protector is ok my complaint is that you have to be superman to plug your device into the outlet
i am a big guy but with this protector i feel like olive oylbefore you purchase this card sandisk mb sd for your toshiba pdas like i did you should visit pda discussion forums like brighthandcom
there had been many instances where data lost occured because of incompatibility between the specific card and toshiba pdas like my toshiba e
sandisk tech support basically throws their hands up and say  quotthey are not compatible with each otherquotif it works for you make sure you keep your data backed up in case something does happen
but backing up data is something you should do regularly anyway
good lucknot the amount of bytes i had in mind but it works and i have not had any problems with iti misread the listing
i was thinking it said it was a  gb card and i read more than once to be certain i was reading it right and still misread it
i was needing a bigger sd card than  mob so i cant really give a good reviewi like my camera its durable and functional
the gizmos are pretty much kept to a minimum
though sony has a patent on a nightvision mode that none of the canons have which is pretty cool if youve seen it first hand
and something that stinks with many canon products in my experience with scanners and camcorders drivers and whatnot always seem to be a royal painthe rca adaptor is ok but a little complicated to put together to use
i had expected to just plug the adaptor into the device and then into the outlet and it does not work that wayi bought these partly to inspire myself to vacuum more often thinking i could listen to podcasts while cancelling out the vacuum cleaner whine
unfortunately these headphones dont quite get there
the noisecancelling works well for lowtomedium volume electric motor noises computer refrigerator but not for a highdecibel machine like a vacuum cleaner
so i guess i live with the dust bunniesthese were bought for my dads computer
he has an intergrated sound card but the speakers sound greatthe only thing i did not like is that the subwoofer is very over powering and would sound awful from the other room
and the subwoofer does not have a way of adjusting the bass so it was stuck like thatthe only way i could componsate for this is using a program with ajustable baseafter that though they sound greatreceived the card promptlythe card would not work in either of my very old olympus  cameras
neither camera could format the card to olympus standards
my new computer however did format the card and i could transfer pictues to and from the card on the computer but still no luck in the camerasmy tech savvy friend could not get it to work either despite  hours of trying everything he could think of
no help on the net eitherlots of suggestions and programs to fix it but nothing workednear as we could tell  of the  mbs had some sort of program written to them as the computer showed  mb available
the computer ignored this but the cameras could not
even a low level format could not remove the data on the  mbmy guess is the card had been previously formatted for another brand of camera and we were unable to change that formatting to an olympus standardtwo other seemingly identical cards purchased some time ago had no problems
one of them was damaged and this was to be its replacementi bought  cards
one card works perfectly
the second card after uploading pictures to my mac when put back in the camera had to be reformattedso this review gives one card  stars and the nd card   hence the  star ratinginitially i bought these speakers because they looked really nice were made by sony and were cheap
i guess none of that made any sense when i initally used them for music
these speakers are just bad for music
however i got a job as a teacher a few years back and i used these speakers for audio books and they worked greati have owned thesesony srsa desktop personal speakers with way power supplyfor quite some time now
i use them with mysony icfswgr amfm shortwave world band receiver with single side band receptionand for listening to shortwave broadcasts and local am stations in conjunction with this particular radio they are good certainly much better than the sony radios mediocre internal speaker
for listening to fm music they are adequate no more there is no bass response whatsoever and trebles border on harshat their current price of  they appear to be priced fairly  but there is something to consider very carefully before purchasing them sonys ac adaptorsony acehg ac adaptoris currently being sold by one of amazons partners wall street photo also known as your highpriced outlet for 
who in their right mind would pay  to power a set of  speakersand to find a reasonably priced aftermarket adaptor is somewhat difficult as sony uses nonstandard plugs i believe however that you can find a suitable adaptor at radio shack at least you can try it out there to see if it works properly  and radio shacks price will almost certainly be better than that of wall street photo whose prices at least as they appear for several products here on amazon are nothing short of outrageous
in addition there is the cost of batteries
it is costly to run these speakers from standard alkaline batteries and the initial cost of good nimh batteries and a charger if you dont already have these items would have to be added to the cost of the speakersits a pity that they cannot be directly powered from a computer via its usb port but i suppose that that is a minor pointfor the purposes i personally use the speakers they are adequate
i would not recommend them for listening to music on cds mps etc but for voice they are finethough made in china they appear to be very wellconstructed like almost all sony productsjust keep in mind that though they cost only  thats not the true overall price
only you can determine whether the total cost for speakers as limited as these is worth it to you
at the time i purchased them it was worth it to me but if i knew then what i know now i think i would have gone with something elsethe cables are middle of the road and that really depends what you are using them for
i bought these to bridge units in my rack to the patch bay in my studioi utilize these tables as a patch cable for my podcasting equipment
they worked as intended and seem to be the best price i could  find at the timehacked off one end to solder on rca connector to convert from behringer balanced outputs to unbalanced inputs
this cable is moderate quality and might cause crosstalk between stereo channelshome studio connections are the place where hosa cables and adapters shine
period
ive never regretted buying hosa products and amazon prices have been great for these kind of items
the state tax thing may give me pause however
i live in one of those statesthis cable is good for close confined areas
easy to manage and secure
also a quick carrying cable for on the go connectionsthese rca cables are well made and dont seem cheap to me
however i do feel like they are very stiff and personally i like cables to have a more supple feel to themperform as advertised nothing more to say really
weird color the grey and orange but i like iti have been buying hosa for a long time and they were always pretty good cable for the money  i still feel the cable is good quality but also feel the newer cable could be slightly better in some respectsnote the image is slightly different then the one i got i think the pic is of the older cable as it is now thicker with a fatter less tapered strain relief i prefer the older more tapered type design see my pic
it looks neater and less clunky i hope they go back to the more tapered clean design but keep the thicker cable which is niceit seems that the new cable is thicker thats an improvement over the older cable of the same type i bought years ago and is nice an flexiblehowever where the new cable falls short is in the molding over the plugs its pretty poor in my opinion
in fact the cable i received has heavy mold marks and excess rubber on the plugs and the strain relief they really need to clean this problem up i consider it sloppy and unacceptable periodthis type of bad molding shouldnt pass qc in any way shape or form
my old hosa cables have great clean molding and no slop molding on any of the connectors i had to trim the excess with a razor bladei am very surprised others have not commented on this am i one of he few to get a sloppy molded plug setif qc was a lot tighter and molding was the hq they put out years ago i would give it  stars but till they fix the issue it will stay at  stars from mesome may say this has nothing to do with the sound or connection while this may be true in my eyes it shows a product that is not being kept at the same level of quality overall as it used to bei for one love a well made product with great fit and finish that is not what i received
time will tell if they hold up like the older cables didi mess with audio equipment a lot and i will say that sometimes the audio does cut out while using these cables but for the most part it does well
if the audio ever cuts out a simple fix would be to twist one of the inputshosa cables are pretty good as long as yuo dont get too rough with them 
they are not repairable
so once they short out they are done
for the price thry are not too badi ordered four of these cables and one was defective so im giving it three stars becuase i dont know if this is a comon problem with this productthese are working in my home studio right now
like most hosa products they work well and cost next to nothing
good no nonsense valuewas charged way too much for the item i love hosa cable but these companies jack up the price sell the items for  times what the price should bei use this for keyboards and short jumper runs on unbalanced systems
other than that they are durable with a cover that resists kinkingthe sound quality these give out is distance and not all the music
you would need to plug in hafe way for the sound to be correctedgood quality but it was the wrong cable i needed female to male ends on the audio plugsthis hosa cable is exactly what i needed to allow me to listen to my ipod touch through a medium quality av receiver and speakers
the sound quality does not appear to be nowhere near my other system consisting of a much higher quality av receiver and speakers
of course the reason is the difference in the components including the hosa cable
to make the comparison even more difficult the two surround sound systems are at different locations
so i cant make an ab comparison
i am satisfied with this purchase as it cost me  of the monster cable i use in the other system
i plan to install the hosa cable in my better setup to make a valid ab comparison and establish onceandforall whether money i spent on the expensive cable was worth it
so the  rating i gave above is subject to the qualifications described herethese are not top of the line nor are they junk mid grade and do what they are supposed toworks great and appears to be sturdy but the  end is very wide and wont fit into a few things
namely my iphonethis cable is just ok for the money the molded end is not sturdy at all and after a few days it began to buzz
i had to tape the cable backwards to keep it workingi bought this to play with recording the electric guitar fender stratocaster using the effects pedals in garageband
it works fine when plugged into the microphone input on the mac
there is no static or hum
this was just the cheapest cable i found for doing this
i didnt want to invest in an apogee though they look nice
im not a professional musician just like to hack at itits about what i was looking for
and it works for what i was needing it to do the jobs i hadas of recent this cable has been added to the cables to have on hand
typically the trs to trs would do the task
now this cable has been added as a cable to have in small confined areasin consumer audio almost everything has standardized on the mm plug headphones inputs and outputs
so when it needed at mm cable i made the mistake of assuming minijack mean the smaller of the two
the size of the connector was deep in the description and i missed it
its still a good cable which i will use in future projects
it just wished they would make the actual size clearer in the descriptionperhaps it is my mistake but this item is labeled as a minijack cable and says mm on the descriptionit just arrived and its just like any other mm cable the quality if good but it is not the right cable i desiredcable is wide and has good terminals but again not what i wantedcuts out sound be careful buying this cheap cable
i would not recommend this cable
you have to spend time twisting and bending the cable to get soundi have a little mixer and my only complaint about this wire is its two short
i cant do anything i use it only when i have my laptop next to itits a cable so nothing to get really excited over
it performs well
be warned that the  male end will not likely fit into a phone or tablet that has a bulky case on it as its kinda fat
thats the only downside thoughi have nothing to compare it to but it works great for my mixer
i wouldnt rave about this product or anything because it certainly isnt one in a millioni have these connected to alesis m  active monitors from my mac mini
i also own the same hosa cables with the rca jacksi did the following test
i hooked each up and noted the volume levels
the rca jacks won clearly  louder output at a lower volume levelat least with my speakerswas happy at first the cables are a little weak and flimsy after connected for a while one speaker quit working
the speaker works fine with hosa dual  ts to  mm cord
will probably return this item
have always been happy with hosa beforethe cables them selves feel nice
the  jack is good but the  side is kinda of funky
i need to twist them around in the jack to get a good signal
not sure if theres some weird coating on them or what
but once they are going they work goodthe packaging was nice
the cord is somewhat of good quality
the dual mono  jacks are very sturdy and well built but the  stereo connection isnt the best
i ordered  of these and with a little snag from an ipod when connected made the  tip disconnect from insidewhen i plugged this puppy in i immediately heard noise in the line
it leads me to believe that the quality of the connectors used is sub pari chose this rating because to no fault of my own it stopped working
i have it plugged in to my computer and mixer
i never touch the cables after installed or moved the mixer
yet some how the right channel stopped working
i plugged the right plug in to other jacks on my mixer even tried plugging the right plug in to the left of my mixer
found out it was the cablei had ordered  hosa xlr twin xlr with computer jackit fell off the order with no explinationit is bad buisness not to say by the way we do not have these items so they will not be sentthe cable causes crackles when being moved around
i shouldve expected this for something so cheap
it works though the picture doesnt lie
look closely at the plugs
this is a mono cable
not stereo
i needed a stereo audio cable
oopsi bought this as a back up plug
it works no real issues
wire is durable and the plug fits snugthese are fine but theyre a bit thin for my tastes and the female end has a habit of unscrewing
still the connection is usually very good with the ones that ive purchased
if youre going to use this like we do for inear monitoring when playing in bars etc i would opt to go with a thicker cable if i were doing it againi listened through my sennheiser hd pro headphones with and without the  hosa extension cable and could not notice any degradation of signal or difference in tone
so the cable is certainly satisfactory in that respect
at its amazon price i have to say that its reasonably priced as well
as for its quality of construction it appears comparable to inexpensive cables in general
ill also say that ive purchased other hosa products and have been satisfied with them
i dont know how well it would stand up to abuse but the answer to any question along that line is simple dont abuse your cables and theyll last a lot longer and provide better service
ill close by reminding readers that the flow of electricity through cables is governed by the laws of physics not the marketing departments of the highend cable manufacturers that charge five or ten times as much for products that do the same thing ie carry a signal from point a to point b
i hope this is helpfulmy first review was not accepted not sure whythese connectorsadapters work fine but they only sent one in my package when it lists twothis was fixed fast thanks to the service dept
and all is well nowhosa makes terrific stuff and they work fine this is more geared toward the service of getting themthey worked for me on my  channel mixing consolei connected my rca y cable and it works just finei recommend theseso if your on a budget for a little home project this will probably fit you fine
if your doing pro work a band that needs long lasting durable goods for travel etc
then spend more money for something higher qualityi didnt think a cheap adapter would be much different than an expensive one as an adapter is an adapter right
well not really these things are hollow inside
i never expected something to be cheeped out like that
now i know howwhy people said they bent these and broke themelectrically speaking having it hollow should produce a signal just as good as a solid one its not like your wire is that thick
mine were also gold colored not silver like in this pictureit should fit my needs fine just for a little home studio where i may have  mics and  other source hooked to a small mixer if they break its not a lot of money to lose i just wouldnt want them to break if i was using them for a job or as a band when failure is not an option
thus why i say spend more if your in that situationworks  but theres a background hum when using it
but for the price what do you expect
we use it on a electric keyboard so the kids can play and we dont have to listenthis little guy gets the job done its not expensive at all and im about to order my second oneupdateokay i ordered my second adapter and it came in guess what
the product was defective the mm jack wouldnt fit seems like something is messed up internally
i contacted them via email hope all goes well
update i have contacted the sellers and they sent another one which was defective as well i gave up
i havent had a chance to update the review but i contacted them a while ago and they sent yet another defective product
your taking a chance when buying these try to buy at least  to ensure yourself at least  useful adapter
 taking  star off for bad quality      the plug works fine
i use it all the time on my stereo and ipod to interchange tham as neededthis isnt rocket science
both ends work as advertised without loosening with use as is often the case
i recommend it for noncritical applicationsit worked well for a few years but its gotten to the point now where its loose and wont maintain a signal in both channels unless its positioned just right
i usually like hosa gear
i have several of their cables and adapters and they are a great bargain
everything has been solid and stood up over time except this
its so much cheaper than the other brands though
i might just get a few more knowing they may not lastgood but expensivefits snugly into receptacle
however when plugging my cable into the right angle adapter itself there was no positive action   seems like friction alone keeps the cable plugged in and it wouldnt take much for accidental disconnect
might tape up the connection for securityi ordered two of these and they work as intended but i cant imagine them being suitable for hardcore use
after a few rounds of plugging and unplugging the rca end the internal components started separating in one of themfeels a little cheap but works well
so i really cant complain
and itll serve me well enough for the small stuff i doand any hum in my recordings i gleefully work on removing in posti bought two of these and they work fine as long you dont plug and unplug them very often
they feel very cheap and if i pull on the ends at all they move
i would not trust it if i was going to be plugging and unplugging it oftenyou can buy these nearly anywhere and ive used hosa plenty of times in the past
it does work and do the job but the shell around the male pin is spread a little to wide
needed to crimp it a bit to ensure a solid connectiongreat product i ues it to connect speaker to speakerand to connect two mikes togetherwould by againgood for playing two guitars through the same ampthis is a nice cheap adaptor but dont expect the female  jack to last forever
if youre using for a onetime hookup youll most likely be fine
but after multiple inserts and removals the  female jack loses its grip which results in signal lossused to feed an stereo in my backyard connect it to the ipod and its working it is outside so i hope the rain does not kill it
so far is okso when i read the other reviews and the product description i thought this would be the adaptor for me as i own a mono output dynamic microphone but i wanted to change that to stereo for my imac
this works and it doesnt
what do i mean
you can get a mono microphone output to work with this to make a stereo sound but it requires you to not plug your mono jack all the way into the stereo receiver
so it doesnt work normally like it should do yourself a favor go to a radio shack and ask them for the correct adaptor
if it doesnt work you can always return itat first appearance the hosa right angle adapter looks nice and sturdy
when in use though there appears to either be a design flaw or poor quality control  all the headphones i tried around  all had connection problems  static sound only on one side of the headphone volume problems
if i fiddled with the headphone jack twisting it in the adapter the problems would go away though if i jostled the adapter the problems popped up again setting off another round of fiddlingive seen the same problem in very inexpensive straight  to mm adapters but at nearly  i was definitely not expecting it of the hosabottomline  there arent many alternatives out there if you want and angled mm adapter and what there is costs much much more
shop around and you can get this for  so buy two and hope one workshave a case on your iphone or ipad
forget about this adapter
it failed to properly seat with an apple smart caseit works well with mysennheiser hd professional headphones with sound channelingand my laptops headphone input socket
however the th inch is a bit too narrow
not sure whats the word for it
but it easily slides out from the audio jack on my laptop
and sometimes itd slip out without me intending toive only tried it once on my mm telephoto and it definitely moved you closer to your subject
i took my pics on an overcast day and the focus  which did work on auto searched alot and sometimes never did achieve sharp focus
picture quality is definitely degraded using the teleconverter with some fuzziness
i plan to try it again on a brighter day
its a nice addition to my photo tools but not sure how much ill use it
i like crisp clear photosthis product works as promised but tamron cant really deliver a good telephoto converter at the low low rate of  brand new
the sp version is  and is sooooo much better i bought both and tested them
keeping the pro sp for surenot really good for djing or industrial strength use
so i use it to plug in my monitors with my laptop at home only and then i have to wiggle and finagle it to get proper contactit works
that said build quality very poor and doesnt seem to transmit at a perfect rate far from perfect but still works good enoughthis is a hard to find adapter taking  line to dual xlr lr line
i purchased it as an emergency way to get my ipod into my console gendered to plug in exactly where the output from my audio interface in case the interface dies
i wouldnt trust this for anything but an emergency shot connection
hosa makes a lot of great stuff on paper hard to find adapters etc  its a shame they dont make  distinct product lines  a pro line that is more expensive but built with materials a professional could count on and their existing line
maybe they do but i havent see them
having cables like this one custom made with quality materials is prohibitive or time consuming if your schedule is crammed so i guess it should be a positive thing these are available
its just a shame i barely trust them out of the package let alone in daily useafter  weeks of testing and research i figured out what the problem was
it appears that graphic cards use a fair amount of power and causes a lot of electrical inference
when this interference hits a pair of amped speakers the inference gets magnified and then gets projected as undesirable noises
this noise would instantly go away whenever i exited a graphic game and would start back up when i reentered the game
i had to buy a dual xlr sound card not cheap and x xlr  xlr cables to get rid of the inferencesif you just plan to listen and create music without playing games this cord should work for you
this cord is not at fault rather all mm plugs are inherently flawed to pick up interference
you wouldnt normally hear the mm inference on cheap desktop speakers or headphones because they arent amped enoughthe cruzer works on one of my laptops running xp and used to work on my other laptop when it ran windows  nd edition
but when i upgraded the second laptop to xp the cruzer stopped working with it
the computer simply does not recognize the presence of the device
the sandisk web site contains no useful information about this problem and is pretty inadequate in general
too bad because the product when it works is quite good and can be a convenient alternative to zip disksok this was kind of an impulse buy
ive had a problem watching tv late at night because if i turn the tv up loud enough to understand voices my wife cant sleep
id considered headphones cordless but ruled them out as i like to lie down to watch tv and headphones would be uncomfortable
then i thought about putting speakers in the headboard of my bed on my side
that way i could add volume on my side of the bed only
it worked by the way
if you have a problem with a spouse who cant sleep while you are watching tv try a set of small speakers on your side of the bed onlyanyway id go with altec lansing speakers for better sound i already own them and use them with my computer but the only decent ones i could find at the cc i shopped in were much more than i wanted to spend
these cyber acoustic speakers were well within my price range so i decided to give them a shotthe cabling of these speakers is horrible
the actual speaker wires are extremely thin and flimsy
whats worse is that the speakers are packaged from the factory with about  six inches of separation between the left and right speakers
im not exaggerating
i almost returned them as at first i thought this was a factory defect
after all you couldnt even use the speakers if they could only be separated by such a short distance
then i noticed that the clip which holds the left and right speaker wires together was adjustable
this isnt much help however
after you move the clip the wires still need to be torn apart to increase the separation between the speakers
the wires are so flimsy that it would be very easy to damage your speaker wires doing this
another problem with the speaker wires is that they are permanently fixed to the speakers
why is this a problem
well its not a problem unless you need to mount the speakers in a cabinet of some kind and want to route the wires out of sight
see theres no way to pass the wires through a cabinet from one speaker to the other without having to put a whole speaker through the cabinet
in my case the areas of my headboard between the left and right speaker are separated by a divider
i wanted to route the cables through the back of the headboard but i couldnt
i had to settle for leaving the cables on the headboard with the speakers
this looks ugly and the cables interfere with my storing other stuff in the headboard
such as tv remoteon sound quality 
well i bought these things to listen to tv with
we have dish network satellite service
i used rca style cables to connect the dish network receiver to these speakers using an adapter that came with the speakers
for tv use the sound is ok  to get the subwoofer volume control this is a separate control from main volume set correctly i hooked up a dvd player to these speakers and listened to one of my favorite music cds
these speakers have lots of really low bass
thats not necessarily good
see while it has lots of low bass the midbass response is rather lacking
so with these speakers you either have not enough bass or too much low bass depending on how you adjust the subwooferfor the price the sound isnt too bad
i wouldnt recommend these speakers if your primary use is to listen to music though
as i said before to listen to tv the sound is decent
i imagine these speakers would be good for computer gaming alsoby the way cyber acoustics claims these speakers are w
they could be but cc seems to think that they are w
i like the power switch and analog volume control on the right satellite speaker
these controls are handy and work wellif you need speakers for music use id recommend something by altec lansing
but try to get an analog volume control if possible
my altec lansing three piece computer speakers are simply awesome for music use mp files and such
they sound much better than my new cyber acoustics speakers
but i dont like the digital updown volume buttons on my altec lansing speakers
davei purchased this speaker set for my daughters mp more than the computer
it has a good sound but there is a sound distorion when you increase the volume
but i cant complain for the price paiddont pay more than  bucks for this itemi dont think these new speakers are as good as the older cyber acoustic models
they just dont have good soundive been using cyber acoustics low end speakers for a few years
i just wanted speakers for a pc i put together myself and they were clean although a bit tinny
i like to hear vocal and piano and they get by
i just got this  piece set as an upgrade and although the two peripheral speakers are a bit better than my original pair the boom box kicks out bass even when i turn it off on the right speaker which is the only control over it i have as my sound card has very limited controls
to me the boom box is an over compensationlike saying now lets add bass
ive faced it against the wall and put a towel over it
ill probably give these to a friend and get their two speaker product
the only reason i have to do that is the power supply runs through the boom box first and then to the periperal speakersif you like clean peripherals and want to feel the booming bass this is a good set for the money especially when shipping is freelove it great for the screen
use it on tv phone pads and computer
does a great job
its really greatthis was recommended by a friend
so far have only used the cloth but expect the cleaner to work well
my big screen tv has not been attracting very much dust so far
dont have a clue whywhen one buys an tv these days especially lcd or plasma you open the box and find a giant do not use column in the manual telling you how virtually everything out there is bad for your tv
in a way this is true but also misleading
there are tons of products out there that are designed for cleaning the screen of your awesome tv but monster personally gives you the best kit for the price
while you are paying a bit of a premium since it is monster brand it is worth it in the end but beware this kit has a monster bite in iti will break this review down into   simple parts the cleaning solution the cloth and review of how well they work together
 cleaning solutionthe misconception when it comes to cleaning your tv especially plasma and lcd is that you can only use cleaning kits
this is not true
the main ingredient of virtually all screen cleaning kits is nothing more than deionized water
with the monster solution even though it is in small print the bottle contains mainly deionized water with some proprietary polymers
the kit that i purchased came with a  fl oz
bottle of solution which is more than enough to last about  years doing cleanings once every other week
the bottle itself is constructed well with a durable spray cap and cover
the solution has a cloudiness to it probably due to the added polymers
 microfiber cloth includedmine came with a in x in   sq ft  cleaning cloth that is double sided
this cloth is one of the better microfiber cloth i have ever owned and is lightyears superior to those free minicloths you might get with an lcd monitor or tv
because the cloth is double sided it can serve as both a wet and dry side at the same time which makes for a very easy cleaning job
there was a lot of detail put into the cloth as even the monster trademark tag on it is made from a nonscratch fiber so there is no worry if it rubs up against the panel
the cloth is very durable and will hold up exceptionally well over multiple cleanings
 cleaning your tvwhen it comes to cleaning your tv with this product this is where i feel the product fails in the end
despite saying it is streak free it is far from it
i attribute this to the proprietary polymer in the solution
when using just straight deionized water no streaks however this product will streak if not cleaned correctly
you have to treat this product as if you were applying wax on the surface of a car to get the maximum effect
below is what i tend to do and it never leaves streaks
pick one side of the cloth and spray a section with solution until moist
using that moist section slowly clean in nice gentle circles around your tv like you would if you were applying wax to a car
do this to cover the entire screen and apply more solution to the cloth if needed
when fully cleaned flip the cloth to the dry side and using the dry side repeat the buffing motion around the tv to essentially dry and buff the screen
it should now be streak free and good as newprior to doing this i simply followed the onbottle directions which simply tells you to wet the cloth and rub it around the screen  repeat as needed
when finished if you looked at the tv just right you saw streaking which i confirmed by shutting the lights off in the room and shining an led flashlight on the tv
the entire screen was just blobs of streaks where solution had been slightly saturated
 overall the product as a team is a great price
you get a high quality cleaning cloth and a good sized bottle of solutioneven if it is mostly deionized water
while the product does work as intended i feel that it perhaps tries to hard to be unique with its cleaning solution
sometimes less is better especially with cleaning compounds and solutions
overall i would give the product  stars simply because the included directions on the bottle leave you with streaks and
so in the end the monster tv cleaningkit gets the job done but not exactly as advertisednote avoid using any cleaning solution that contains standard water or alcohol  ammonia in it
water simply because it isnt exactly healthy to toss water onto an lcd panel since there is no protective shield can eventually cause electrical problems
alcohol  ammonia have actually been known to eat away at the lcd screen over time
while you wont see the effect immediately over time with repeated cleanings using alcohol  ammonia you will see color fading in certain spots or even dead pixels  subpixels starting to show up
this is because alcohol based products eventually dry the plastic up which then cracks thus killing your screen old lcds were glass but current generation lcds use a plastic polymer and glass blend the alcohol dries up the plastic portion of the screen thus eventually ruining itnote cleaning cloths do not last forever
eventually the dirt and dust they collect starts to work against you scratch the screen
while you can wash the cloths it really isnt recommended
as long as you take good care of your cleaning cloth and dont spill anything crazy on the tv screen the cloth should last you quite a few yearsi really wanted to like this monitor
it comes in a nice sleek package and was very easy to setup
color was acceptable as well as response time
however text was fuzzy no matter what i did to adjust
not terrible but not as sharp as i had expected
in the end this monitor went back to amazon which still has the best return policy in the universethat is the question
one of the major reasons is to regain desktop space this one does it
another one to save electricity hopefully can be argued in its favor too
even the price plays in favor of the cornea mpb  lcd monitor the best deal in flatscreens at the time we were shopping for one a few weeks ago
now one thing that this beauty doesnt do display with cripsness
unfortunately in spite of following the guidelines provide to autotune it etc
bold fonts in particular are very fuzzy which is a oneway ticket to headache land
so save yourself and do some more shopping
this sure is a bargain but not a good lcd unfortunately
in fact were returning it and settling for the loss of desktop space for nowi like the display of the ds and its features are very nice
however when i compared the recording quality against the sony icdbp the difference was like day and night
if you want it just for voice recording it might work just fine
i wanted good quality recording so that i can record my piano playing
on the ds the recorded piano sound hardly sounded like anything but broken music
it also has annoying background noises which becomes very obvious when the volume is turned up
the sony bp also had switches on the back which allows easy control of vor and playback speed
whereas on the ds you have to go through a set of menu options to make the necessary adjustmentsthese certainly work well in myolympus d mp digital camera with x optical zoom and last a lot longer than alkaline batteries but i only got about  images and a few short  minute movies out of one battery
and if i did a lot of optical zooming the camera would slow down for a bit until it rested
when the first battery in the  pack died i put in a new one
ive taken around  photos on the new battery and then i checked the voltage on it compared to the one i hadnt used yet   volts for the dead one and  on the new one
pretty closei just got the new lithiumion battery  charger for kodak crv crv c  dx  dx  dxset and couldnt be more pleased  rechargeable batteries and charger and for about the same price as this  packi bought this along with my kodak dx camera thinking it would be really nice and convenientwell it is nice and convenient  easy to set up and works well
one touch and it sends the pictures to the computer
the charger works fine too  i think the problems others may have are more related to the battery than the charger
but here are the drawbacks of this product too expensive  i later discovered there are cheaper battery chargers by kodak as well
they dont transfer images to the computer like the dock does but i dont think thats a big deal after all
do a search for battery charger and youll find quite a few good alternatives to this camera dock they should have had a way to turn off the charger
right now when im done charging the batteries in the camera i remove the camera since the  lights just stay on forever
i know that the batteries will not get damaged from overcharging but those  lights staying on forever eventually seems wasteful
since theres no switch to turn off the charger you have to remove the camera if you dont want the lights to stay on forever
kinda defeats the purpose of having a dock in the first place where youd like to just leave your camera in it till you need to take pictures againso overall it works as intended to transfer the images from the camera to the pc and it charges the batteries fine
but it could do with improvements and it really needs to get less expensivei may be doing something wrong but the dock wont send pics to my pci still have to plug into the camerait does keep my batteries chargedso i guess its worth the priceheres the problem with these quotminiquot cd players they use a fullsize cd mechanism
no manufacturer has had the guts to build a dedicated minicd reader mechanism so all the socalled minicd products just try to pack the guts of a full size cd reader into a smaller package
the result is something thats only  cm smaller in linear dimension than its full sized brethren
not too compellinghaving said that the unit is not bad its just not small
there are occasional quirks in the audio between songs as others have reported and the unit seems slightly more prone to skipping than other cd players ive used
continous jostling movement eg
jogging will result in occasional skipping
note i recently downgraded my review as the display stopped working a few months after purchase
when it works the unit is pretty good but its kind of hard to use with the display outthree year updateit finally died
it got medium levels of use and under some hot conditions
i would have expected to last longertwo year updatei now keep this in the very very hot car in the desert and its still alive two years later
gotta like thati have given up on using the menu buttons since they are too distracting for driving
still it works as a good cheapandeasy mp player
those little cds are wonderfulstrengths its inexpensive and the small cds are an inexpensive handy format
one little cd holds about four or five regular cds when ripped to mp
 it is relatively simple to use i takes advantage of the open mp trend and the cdr burners we now all have
 efficient use of batteries
it seems like a pair of aas last a long time  certainly way longer than a traditional cd player
 did i mention that it was inexpensiveweaknesses lower bitrate mps dont sound great or even work
 it really needs a lidbutton lock
its quite easy to accidentally open or press a button
 it is a little clunky  especially when compared to some of those cool mp or minidisk players
 the display is slow so you have to stare at it a long time to see all the mp tagad a tough time getting the unit to be recognized on several computers
it you happen to have a computer that likes this reader it works just fine
but some older computers never recognized this unit no matter what i tried
the sandisk sddra xd  sm reader is a much better buy if you need to read smartmediamy  antenna version is still working after  years
i rarely will have to reboot it
the wireless functions work ok too however there are newer routers out there that have a lot more features
speaking of features most of the configuration settings dont work
for instance the port  remote management never worked right from the get goi would like to upgrade my router to one with more wireless security features however since this baby still works like a champ with my desktop im going to keep it and run ethernet cables throughout my house to the other computers and not set up a wireless networkif you can still find this router out there you may want to get it for its solid stability but as mentioned dont get your hopes up too high with the browser based configuration settingsdanas instructions stated i installed the latest firmware for the router which obviously is on their site and followed instructions
no big deal
it worksbut if you are the type who think they know everything and dont take time to read instructions or if you are not comfortable with computers go with another brand because updating the latest firmware may not be for yousignal strength fluctuates around  to  at  feet my bedroom to the living room
cant really notice a drop off in performance but maybe if i had a larger apartment pits an all around good cable router which allows me to check my email and surf the web without having to buy ft of cat  cablei bought the dlink wireless router to go with my home office net and it workd well except for a mechanical not computer problem
i hooked everything up to directions and when it became necessary to plug the cat cable into the router it wouldnt fit
the cable keeps popping out of the jack
thinking it was just a bad cable i tried  others and got the same results
after calling support i was given an rma and they shipped out another unit
happily i hooked it up but i had the same problem
i called support again and have another rmai also happened to see a tech in a large wellknown outlet store who said he uses dlink routers and has never had a problem
he asked me to bring it in for a free inspection and thats just where im heading todayim using it with  desktop pcs and an axim  with a cf card wifi adaptor and it works well when the cable stays put
i get a message on my desktop that a network cable is unplugged then another that says cable is reconnectedtry before you buythis card is great when it works once you get the drivers and firmware up to date anyway but seems to be prone to problems
i bought two of these cards originally for two different laptops one a gateway the other an ibm both running windows xp
all of a sudden one laptop started rebooting spontaneously sometimes then sometimes locking as windows xp restarted and sometimes it wouldnt turn back on at all
i was baffled by it until in desperation i tried popping the card out and all of a sudden no more problems
i swapped the card with the other one and the exact same problems migrated to the other laptop
i called dlink and they crossshipped a replacement card though it took most of a month to get it which worked fine for a month and now seems to be causing the same problems again
i wont be buying another one of theseinstallation of the dwl is a breeze
dlinks install process and software is better than some ive seen
and certainly its highspeed performance when matched with a compatible wap is a benefit and a cheaper option than other faster wireless standardsi have used the card for a couple of months and find two primary annoyances the configuration software for the dwl doesnt support passphrase entry of the wep encryption strings as some other wireless cards do forcing you to typein the strings
and type you do since the software doesnt allow you to paste from the clipboard perhaps you keep your wep strings in a text file  if you do itll do you no good with the dwl
i should note that if you allow windows xp to manage your wireless connections this is a nonissue since you can paste into the windows configuration dialogs
for some reason pptp vpns do not work through this card at least with windows xp
ive tested it in two different laptops and the results are the same attempts to use the remote network over a pptp connection with the dwl simply fail for no particular reason
switch to a different brand of card same wap same vpn configuration same laptop  and things are fine
ive read other reports of this type online as well so i dont think its just me
all that said i do like the native configuration softwares ability to sniff out available networks though once again windows xp can do this itself as well but the native software does it better
and the card does seem to capture and hold signal to the wap quite nicely and better than other brands ive triedso for basic use the card is fine and would probably satisfy most usersthis is a good wireless card with a couple of plusses and minusesminusesa its b w a proprietary mbps mode not g  dont be fooled by the higher speedb it uses a proprietary texas instruments chipset that is incompatible with linuxc to get the mbps you have to use all dlink airplus equipment or equipment by the very small number of other manufacturers who use the same ti chipsetplusesa at least when i got it it was quite inexpensiveb the drivers are stable and the management applet was easy to usec if you do get all tibased equipment you get noticeably better performance than a standard mbps b systemfinal verdict if you can buy g equipment not bwe received this item around nov  the initial setup was problematic and afterwords it worked some of the time but mostly it would lock up the laptop
after several calls and emails to tech support they finally acknowledged that the problem might be with the card and not with the laptop
they sent us a replacement card and issued an rma for the original card which we had to pay to ship to them
the replacement card that they sent works fine no crashes at all in the last two weeks
very disappointed with their tech supportas a previous reviewer wrote incompatible with sounblaster live cards due to a conflict with the memory io ccf being used used by both cards
disable one or the other and your fine both will cause a bsodblue screen of deathin my home i am fortunate to have both a wired and wireless network installation
i recently completed the upgrade of the wired portion from  megabyte per second mps to mps a total of two servers and one workstation
the cost of pci  network interface cards nic have come down in price to such a degree that not switching would have been in my opinion sillybut converting my wireless network to mps was impossible since such high throughput is as yet unrealized in the wireless arena however it is coming
dlink and several other manufactures now offer mps the g standard but at a cost i am not willing to pay yet
however dlink also offers a mps solution in both wireless access point wap pc card and nicmoving my wireless network segment to mps meant an investment in an all new wap since the current wap was capable of only mps
dlink has been on the forefront of home wireless technology for the last few years and offers a suite of products to suit my modest needs
so i watched and waited for a good sale and when one happened my way late last year i purchased the mps dlink dwl  ap wireless access pointand the complement the dwl  i purchased two dlink dwl  wireless pci nic adapter cards
the dwl  operates at a frequency of  ghz and supports the following wireless standards  ieee  ieee b and can transmit and receive traffic at the following data rates mbps mbps mbps mbps and mbpsnot ready for windows xpdespite dlinks claim these cards will not work with windows xp out of the box
both my primary workstation and that of my spouse run windows xp home
both pcs also have linksys wpc wireless nics installed and running flawlessly but the cards are limited to mbs throughputhoping the installation of the dlink dwl  would be painless who was i kidding
 i installed the first card in my workstation
true to form windows xp detected the new card and then prompted me for the software which i eagerly fed it
but then a funny thing happened on the way to mps wireless heaven nothing
the card didnt work
not only did it not detect the wap scant  feet away but it also locked up my computer
so i rebooted same result lock up
puzzled i restarted windows xp in safe mode same result lock up
i then removed the card and booted into the last known good hardware configuration but windows xp refused to play
end result operating system os reload
needless to say i was not amusedthinking this might be an aberration or that i might have a defective card because after all i experiment with my workstation constantly i attempted to install the second card in my spouses computer same result sans os reload thank god
i called dlink technical support not luck
in fact i knew more about the cards then they didon a whim i installed the first card in a spare windows  server box result the card worked
i then installed it into a windows  computer result the card worked again
needless to say in frustration i shipped the cards back to amazoncom and got a full refund
and now i am back to where i started mpsconclusionthe dlink dwl  while the perfect mate for windows x and windows  computers does not work with windows xp so you are now forewarned
since windows xp was able to detect the physical card i have come to the conclusion that the drivers are to blame
since my experience with the dlink dwl  the company to my knowledge has not updated the drivers but certainly cannot be ignorant of the problem
bottom line if you run windows xp this is not the card for youabout my situation i live about  miles west of most of the broadcast antennae for digital tv in the dc area
wanted an antenna that would get me access to most dtv stations without a lot of fuss
i have a coax cable run in my house that permits me to put the antenna on the top floor and connect it to my tv on the main floori tried theterk lowprofile indoor antenna tvwhich did not provide a significant improvement over the portable telescoping stub antenna that came with my wintv tuner
that being said the reception was very slightly improvedended up purchasing and keeping theterk hdtva indoor amplified highdefinition antenna for offair hdtv receptionwhich was better for my situationbe aware this antenna is  feet wide when fully assembled
takes up a lot of roomi got this antenna after borrowing a directional philips phdtv antenna from a friend
despite getting pretty mediocre reviews on amazon that one got pretty good reception in my apartment but only in one direction as it was designed to do
this antenna from terk is multidirectional so it gets a lot more channels but only a couple of them are coming in  clear
this product had such positive reviews that i expected it to perform at least as well as the antenna with poorer reviews
one of these weekends when it bugs me enough ill probably try moving it around some more to see if theres a better spot but its so big that there arent many places i can put itthis antenna works okay but not that much better than an unamplified pair of  rabbit ears ive used
it does pull in the digital stations without the amount of moving around required to get the rabbit ears pointed in the right spotone thing that did surprise me no i guess i didnt read the dimensions this is not lowprofile the unit is actually very large
in the end i couldnt use it on the tv i had it planned for as it was just too big to fit on top or behind the flat screenin brief this antenna gave only sporadic success and i found thehdtvaworked better for mebefore any antenna review i should let you know the environment in which i tried ittuner built into a new philips  plasma model pfabuilding tall single story on a high basement on a hill plasterlathe wood sidinglocation residential neighborhood mostly single family homes lots of large tall treesterrain urbana il  flat only a few tall buildings  miles away on campustransmitters check antennaweborg for details but in summary i have close stations in multiple directions and the furthest reception desired was from decatur about  miles westthis was the third antenna i tried after buying a new television with builtin digital tuner
first i tried the passive radio shack id been using for analog
this gave me only one digital station
online research led me to want an amplified unit
thanks to reviews here and elsewhere i wanted to buy a terk but found only a jensen at first
this was worse than the rs i returned it and got both the tv and the hdtva
i really wanted to like the  i liked the appearance and so many people online say it works for them
it was the first to give me all stations if i worked at it hard enough
i could not repeat the results though
i had to move it for every single station
i dont just mean rotate it i mean find a new place in the room
in contrast it takes only two different positions for me to get everything reliably with the hdtvaso in summary it does technically work but i found it too unreliable
it may work better for you a lot of people do seem to like itone other warning check the dimensions
online pictures and even the box didnt prepare me for the size of the unit
when assembled the wingspan was about twice what i thought it would behaving read the reviews i had high hopes but frankly this underpreformed the new terk hdtvi amplified antenna
admitedly im in a bad area
smack in the middle of beverly hills in nd story stucco garden apartment
but even putting this antenna outside it was no different than my  year old terk
it picked up a chinese channel and a couple of spanish channels probably because of the strong signal strength
there were still the ocasional glitch thoughnow the terk hdtvi was not much better but it did pick up cbs and kcop so two channels more is a big difference
im sure that if youre in line of sight or if signal strength is strong this terk will do the job but clearly the hdtvi is betterim not sure what my next step is
maybe a rooftop antenna btu i dont want go there
im hoping that the other networks pump up their broadcast signal
not sure why cbs is coming in  so well but i supect strength of signal unless they transmit from some where other than mt
wilsonit is a memory stick there is not much to say about it
it did not fail or destroy any of my data which is about all you can say about such products
im still a little hesitant about this price point for the product in comparison to other formats  mb is starting to become a very small amount
one note it is not translucent purple as it appears in the image it is the dull purpleblue of all of the other sony memory sticksbut not much more
this is a handy little digicam with very limited capabilities the best of which is its ability to function as a very adequate webcam broadcasting at a standard internet quality resolution of  x  as a camera for general photography however this is far from adequate for anything other than emailing images posting pictures to websites or dropping pictures into reports
there is not enough resolution to make printable pics even standard quot x quot will look grainy and the lack of any kind of zoom limits its use further
it is easy to use happily runs on a single aaa battery has an adequate but nonexpandable internal memory and attaches easily to your pc via any usb cable
if youre looking for an inexpensive webcam that just happens to offer easy pocketability in case you want to take it with you for some potential photo opportunity you can hardly go wrong at this price
however if youre really looking primarily for a camera as opposed to a webcam youd be advised to look elsewherethis is a great product
i researched for months and months and finally decided to go with the  series
while if i were to do it again id get the  just becuase its bluetooth enabled but itll be another year or so before bluetooth is used widely enough to justify the extra hundred bucks
no complaints with the ipaq itself execpt for the fact that i have a pixel out smack dab in the center of the screen
amazon wouldnt take it backbecause i live in japan and after i had my visiting friend hand deliver it to me i couldnt get it back to america in time for amazon to feel they had an obligation to help me outother than by referring me to the manufacturer
so i had it sent to a compaq repair center and it was sent back to me with an explanation that my annoying pixel outage was within their accepted industry standard and they wouldnt repair it or replace my product
what a bunch of hay
what about my standards
i bought their product brand new for around  and they dont care that its defective and really annoys me
bad customer service has likely cost compaq a previously devoted customeri sort of love this cobra roadtrip cb gadget but only when im home and when i can use my both hands on it
its a bit cumbersome to use while driving and its too heavy to handle especially if you have batteries installed in it so for that purpose i recommend buying the external microphone
i bought a bnc to standard vhf antenna adapter so i can attach my real home and car cb antennas to itmost important thing to remember is to use the external antenna  its practically useless without it when youre in a car unless you have a buddy in a car next to yours
antenna preferably external is the key part of every cb station
i have a  whip antenna and i sometimes take it up to the roof of our  floor building and talk to people who cant believe how far i am
moreover they cant believe that im talking from a handheld battery operated cb radio
in order to persuade them i just unscrew that antenna and use the smaller telescopic one and if they can hear me they will confirm i sound like it should
one guy about  miles away was saying that his signal meter was close to the max while i was using the big antenna and he could barely hear me with the telescopic onethe major flaw of this radio when i compare it to my low end midland cb is the way its squelch feature works or does not
i dont know whether its just my particular radio or whether this is a flaw of the entire series but you have to set your squelch level unreasonably high which makes you miss a lot of conversations further away from you
when you set your squelch level a bit lower or whenever someone is right on the edge of squelch threshold you will hear a lot of unusual noise coming from the radio almost as if it is undecided and it keeps oscillating back and forth from passing and blocking the signal
this sounds like a driver next to you is pressing and releasing the ptt button  times a second and it is much louder than the rest of the sounds you can hear on this radio so it can be very disturbing especially when you are driving and your loved one is asleep next to younimh batteries last forever and i dont ever connect it to my cars  v lighter output any more
however another downside is that it requires two different external sources one for charging the batteries and the other for just using the car power
the provided cable is good only for using the car power and it doesnt charge the batteries
why not use the same connection for boththe manufacturer claims that soundtracker dramatically improves the sound quality of the transmission and reception of cb radio signals
i cant see a big differenceall in all its pretty cool to have a hand held cb but thats all what it is
i dont recommend it for driversi have had my acoustimass system since around  and its been a long road over the years acquiring better sound through pseudoupgrades and home entertainment advancementsthe initial setup is terrible
the center speaker is way too small to provide adequate voice ambiance and i recommend from the getgo just buying a better center speaker
i got a polk audio about  years ago and it was totally worth itmoreover i switched out the front rightleft with bose vs to try and be consistent with company name and retain a more balanced audio without fiddling too much with the receiver audio eq
it certainly widened the front speaker environment and was worth upgrading based on the desire to keep my acoustimass as the main home theater systemi move a lot over ten years ive had to set up and break down these speakers at least  times
i used the four original small speakers for rear surround and made a  setup
it sounded good and always has
i threw away the center speaker a long time ago and just last month one of the four original speakers blew
now its a  system and im saving up to get a more proper home theater that will make me never ever choose bose ever againi dont play at extremely high volumes i have apartment neighbors i dont wish to disturb
regardless audio levels for this system isnt meant to blow you out of the water
thats a sacrifice of small speaker home theaters
at the same time ive been using these for ten years to have a speaker finally go kaput doesnt warrant too much sadness from me
one of the other speakers had a faulty wire input the button to depress the clamps was stuck in the open position and i couldnt get the wire to connect with the speakers
i hate this design its terriblethese are perfect if you want to keep a smaller footprint when moving and is fine if you like good sound and have a small placethey certainly sound good and present better fidelity when using lossless audio on blurays
the switch to dvd audio is noticeablehowever if you want true quality audio these bose speakers are going to be lackingprossmall spacesaving speakerslasted for  years so fardecent soundconsshould at least get a new center speakersmall size and hype doesnt compare to better speakers even in similar price range but a little largerthe speakers have a badly designed button to open the wire clampsin the end if you want to have a muchimproved performance from the bose acoustimass expect to invest at least  more dollars for a center speaker up to  more for center speaker stands andor new front lrsso instead of  youd expend  for your home theater
is it worth it then
kindasorta
if youre a smart shopper you can find large front speakers rear bookshelf speakers and a decent  sub for the same price or even a couple hundred more and youll be x more satisfied with the audio than dishing out decent sound from the bosei say save your pennies a couplefew months longer and just get the better system right away unless youre adamant about going bose or saving spacei have decided that  years will be the expiration date for these and even though i move and have to pay for extra weight and use up more space i want a massive upgrade from these average performersi have had a set of the acoustimass series speakers since the early nineties
at the time i thought they were some of the best speakers i ever had why
because i was told they were by marketing
i still have them and they have performed well and have lasted a long time and i expect they will  last for years to come
if you use them in a surround sound application they are ok  but if you use them for audio only they are lacking in mid bass and low bass is virtually non existent
the sub is non powered as has been stated in other reviews and thats the problem
i have tried positioning what they call a sub in various ways and get the same results in every applicationhowever if you add a powered sub as i have they are good speakers and will perform  better
i paid  on sale at the time
i see now they have come down in price quite a bit
the bottom line if you want a system that requires little space and use it for movie watching they are fine but if you want to enjoy your music i would suggest searching for a set of speakers that are more conducive to listening to music
the kenwood  and s i had at one time were far better speakers for listening to music but i got rid of those when i purchased the bose
i wish i would have waited a bit before i got rid of them but i thought i was upgrading
little did i know i was down gradingthe only reason i can get good quality sound out of the non powered version i have and why ive kept them so long is because i have quality stereo components to include eq processor and reverb so i can make these speakers sound like theyre jbl concert series speakers
but without a quality system to run them i would pass personallyas an fyi i got the bose center channel speaker and rear surround sounds to compliment these speakers
like i said in this application they are as good as ive heard with the system i have
i will also say that as far as music listening goes it will depend on the style of music you listen to
if you like classical style music for example they couldnt be better as they deliver instrument separation very well
but if you like country or rock you will need a system like mine to drive them and thats when theyre at their best
i gave them  stars simply because they require too much assistance in delivering what they are capable ofit may seem strange but just about all the complaints and praise are validit is necessary to match the right speaker system to the correct needs
i have owned a bose acoustimass system for over  years
i hated it at first until i finall got it adjusted to my x living room
it took about a year of constant fine tuning to get it to sound like the demo in the bose store
now i can hear the different instruments in a song or movie firing from different points in my living room
i did feel ripped off by bose in the first year of owning this system
i blame bose for not working with their customers in order to ensure satisfaction
they have a good product but their staff is geared to sell sell sell and no customer satisfactionthe problem with the bose acoustimass  system is that it is not a powered system
repeat it is not powered
you will need an amplifer or receiver
this creates a variable in the sound and creates a host of more wires
people looking for a two satellite system are not looking for more wiring and complication
they are looking for simplicityi originally bought this system to pair with a  samsung led television in my bedroom
the electronics of the acoustimass overpowered my bedroom which is quite large
i had wires and equipment running all over the room
my wife was not happy
i decided to send this unit back and purchase the cinemate system which has two speakers and a powered bass module
this system is so powerful that i was forced to moved this system into our recreation room
the  sound is now excellent with the powered bass unitbose needs to change the acoustimass  system to a powered system and it would be ideal for someone that wants the rich bose sound without all the satellitesbtw i purchased a quality powered sound bar for my bedroom  samsung led television
wife is happy and she now makes me happybose acoustimass speaker systems are a strange animal
you either love them or hate themits a funny thing this guy was at my house and heard my quad esl speakers electrostatic  with about  worth of electronics and made the comment that they sounded almost as good as his boseso there you go beauty is in the eyes of the beholdermyself im not too keen on bose and i could go on a tirade about what i dont like about them but in the end its what you think
if they make you happy then by god youve made the right choicebose are very colored speakers bright highs and warm syrupy bass
this is a sound that many people like
the fact that they dont take up much room fits into many lifestylesif you like accuracy and want to get closer to real then try something elsefor me bose has a pleasant sound that is nice to listen to at low volume when i just want background sound
i can even think of other uses for these in non critical applications
ive even considered them for a second tv
they are much better than the speakers that come in tvs nowadaysfor the  they are asking for these  you could do much worse
you could also do much better depending on your preferenceswould i recommend these
sure depending on whether someone wanted a small unobtrusive system or whether they liked the bose sound
if i felt the person was inclined toward accuracy clarity and soundstaging then i would steer them away from thesedoes bose deserve all the accolades that it receives
not really
they are very over rated but still theyre not bad speakersi gave these a  star rating only because in some circumstances these are perfect for the application
if i were to rate it against my preferences i would give it a lower ratingbtw this applies to all acoustimass systemsoh theres one more thingbose likes to use the directreflecting concept of sound
this has the effect of making the sound more spacious but it destroys the soundstaging
people in high end audio go to great efforts to eliminate or disperse reflections because it ruins soundstaging and causes frequency aberrations nulls and peakssome have commented that the microphone is disabled when switching to speaker mode
if the mic needs to stay live just plug it directly to the sound card rather than using the mic portion of this switchi love this product because of the ability to switch from speakers to headset without plugging cords in and outpros  no plugging and unpluggingcons  no upgradeability to  audio
the build quality is cheap
sure its just a switch in there but that means the footprint could be less with higher quality plastics rubber feet to prevent it from sliding aroundthe functionality is there and its hard to beat the price
it does what its supposed to do
flip the switch one way and you can use your headset
flip the switch the other way and you can use your speakers
one of the issues i ran into is that when the switch is in the headset position the speakers hum
when i switch to speaker mode the hum goes away
also the microphone only works when the switch is in the headset mode
so i only use the switch for the speakers and headset and leave my microphone plugged directly into the computeri dont use it much but it does allow me to use the extra lenses that went with a much larger slr cameraworth buying if you need to use a larger lens than is on the cameramine is an olympus camedia c  ultra zoom an older one with  x zoom
i love it
birds in tree tops look like they are  feet awayanniethe cla lens adapter tube seems very difficult to position so it will thread straight into the lens barrel
i lose a lot of time getting it positioned just exactly right
other than that it is fine  it fits the camera and the telephoto lens and seems to hold the rather heavy lens quite securely once it is properly positionedonkyo is a relatively large japanese audio makeronkyo is popular but middle class makeraccuphase and luxman are the best japanese audio makersunfortunately i had to send it back because it was damaged in shipping
i tested the amp on my system and it seems to function ok the amp gave off a sight buzz but it did not appear to be in the sound coming from my speakers
overall i was disappointed
im going to spend the extra money on an emotivawell sorry but doesnt  really work as advertisedive been using the terk with a couple of sangean and one grundig radio
sometimes it helps reception and sometimes it seems to make no differencebought the terk advantage  with hopes it would perform better than the little  x  loop that came with my sangean hd radio tuner
it doesnt seem to help in the daytime but at night makes enough difference to note
tried both aircoupled and directly connected to the ant terminals
the terk made little or no difference during the day but at night when the stations i want to listen to reduce power the signal strength will increase several counts when i place the terk next to the factory loop
unfortunately i still get unreliable daytime hd reception with occasional dropouts of the hd signal
tuning of the terk is critical
too bad they did not incorporate gear reduction vernier tuning
hopefully when the broadcasters finally start transmitting hdam at night the terk will provide enough signal to make it work
i am in the dfw area and the am stations i want to listen to are all localnot as good as i hoped
however it is better than not having oneafter reading a lot of mixed reviews on this product i decided to go ahead and give it a try
i am a big talk show guy mainly local talk and sports shows and most of my stations were coming in okay
but when a local station kcoh changed from  to  it was not coming in as clear as it use to
also the jim rome show switched from a very strong station  to  where i could barely hear it
i ordered this thru amazon and it arrived very promptly
i hooked it up to my tunerpreamp bk pt series ii and had mixed feelings
it pulled in the above mentioned problem stations but most of my other stations wre not as clear
i started tuning the dial and moving the antenna around and it helped somewhat but not muchthen the cable disconnected from the loop antenna and all of a sudden the station i was listening to came in better than it ever had before
i started checking my other stations and they also sounded better than ever
so now i just leave the antenna cable unhooked from the antenna loop for most of my stations and if there is a station thats still not clear such as  i hook the antenna cable back to the antenna loop tune it in using the dial on the loop and it comes thru loud and semi clear
not quite working the way i thought it would but it worksi tried using this for a radio that i bought ti get a station that is  miles away and it did not work
now with cell phones having internet i am sure you would do better to get a cell phone to listen to the radio fromi purchased this antenna to receive conservative talk radio that i thought i wasnt receiving it turned out i was on the wrong frequency
i live in a rural area and i thought it was due to signal strengthmy radio does not have a plugin to boost the am signal but the instructions say that you can place it along side the radio and it will work also
to be honest i couldnt tell the difference on any stations so i returned the unit for a full refund
i figured since it was a high price unit it would work better than it didunit has a tuner at the bottom center that allows you to fine tune the channel in
i give it a  star because it wasnt anything special and seem to me that it was over priced
it may work for someone else better possibly if they have a plug on their radio for amthis is the most expensive of this type of antenna by  to 
yet the manufacturer does not see fit to provide a cord that has the miniphone plug on both ends of the cheap little cord that is provided to attach the antenna to the radio
i would guess that at least half of the radios this antenna would be used with have a miniphone plug as the antenna input
and terk or whoever makes this thing cannot spend another  cents to provide a plug or  cents to provide another corddidnt notice any change in the signals i was trying to receive
my radios eton  st and super radio continued to operate the same on distant stationswe have a kitchen radio where several am stations contain a lot of static
this despite us being in a good location on a hill with the radio towers visible
i figured i would try this
it made no difference
i suspect theres some sort of interference or that some of our aluminum siding on part of the house is causing the problem
the radio also has no antenna connector  just the builtin antenna  which limits my options
i returned this since it didnt work for me
the return process with amazon was painlessi purchased this hoping it would be an improvement over my existing rabbit ears for a new atsc tv i have in a guest bedroom
it was no better in fact they were worse than the ge model tv that i purchased at a big box department store
some stations that i could coax a picture out of with the ges i cannot with the terk tvs
so either the tv is just not that good or the ge is better than i thought
my next try might be one of the philips silver sensorsthis antenna didnt work well for me but that doesnt mean it wont work well for you
my advice is to try out several antennas and see which one works the best for your situation
dont even bother reading reviews because what works for one person might not work well for anotherit worked some of the time
i had to keep pushing the buttons on the infrared device until it changed the channels or cut the devices onfor the most part i am pleased with it if it had cost more i would have returned it
maybe it is my own set up and equipment
the ir transmission signal gets interference from the tv set
if i turn the tv set off the terk remote extender works flawlessly
some times it works without a problem others not not  reliable
i tried plugging it in different electric outlets as they recommend and it didnt do it
i bought it mainly for operating my directv satellite receiver
perhaps it is the directv receiver if the receivers ir sensor is somewhat blocked by the terks little sensor detector that you place in front of the component when having problems with transmission as terk recommends the remote wont work
finding the right angle to place this little sensor is tricky and time consuming
perhaps telephone signals also interfere with the transmission
in any case it could be betteri purchased the terk leapfrog to control my tivo from the bedroom after running cables for the audiovideo through the wall
in the end this has worked excellently for me  so let me explain why it doesnt get the full  starsinitial setup with this product couldnt be easier
you simply unpack the two pieces plug in the two included ac adapters  and thats it
i was surprised there was no programming it to accept certain ir codes  it just picks up whatever the remote might be throwing out and relays it appropriately
when i first unpacked it i set the one unit right in front of my tivo sitting about  inches from the tivos ir receiver
i took the other one into our bedroom and plugged it in
presto  i could control the tivo from the bedroomnow that id confirmed it worked i went back to my living room to try and find a nice out of the way place for the terk leapfrog to sit
it obviously had to have a clear line of sight to the tivo which i figued left me with plenty of choices
i tried putting it on a bookshelf that was on quite an angle from the tivo  but with no luck
i tried hiding it behind a picture frame where is still had a clear line of sight to the tivo on a table that was closer to the tivo but again no luck
i went on to try  other places around the room but could never make it work consistentlyfinally i placed it behind the tivo and used the included ir extender which is a little cable with a peanut sized ir transmitter on the end
i snaked this little cord under the tivo and then attached the little ir transmitter so its aiming right at the tivos ir reciever
this finally worked
just for comparison i can aim my tivo remote almost anywhere in the room and have the signal picked up by the tivo so im confident that the tivo is not the problem hereso  the good thing about this product is that it does work  the bad thing is that it seems it needs to be aimed by a professional sharpshooter to get the signal to your deviceprossuper fast setupworks great with your tivoconshard to get the placement of the ir sender just rightsony has a default  day warranty

the web site service descriptions suggest that sony isnt very strong in the service department but weve not calledweve twice experienced a complete reset with total data loss on this device
once might have been due to the battery cover coming loose
watch that battery coverseveral users have commented that the text is very fine and hard to read
a japanese developer has generously provided a fix for the world the resulting fonts are quite readable
thinfontfixi bought this pda a few months after it was released
i was happy with it except a few things
i didnt like that it was bampw or that is was not rechargable
there was alot todo with it until almost all the pdas on the market went color then the software was limited
i really like the functionality and the features
but now i have updated
i would recomment going for the song sj for a little more money
tis color and recharagable and alot more funtionali do not regret buying it but it is slow on shuffle
expect it to last only a year or so i had a  cd sony changer before this that started skipping after  months of use
frankly i am surprised at this lack of quality from sonyadded edit on december   this is now skipping too
im not pleasedthe following is an except of a review that i wrote for the cx the predecessor of the cx
i downloaded the user manual for the cx to make certain that this essential part was applicable and that seems to be the casefor me the natural way to find the disc that i want to play is to begin by selecting the artist name and then peruse the titles by that artist
the capability that comes closest is the artist mode
from the player you press the artist mode button
you use the jog dial to scroll through the list of artist names and when you find the one you want you press in on the jog dial
that engages artist mode which changes the behavior of the perusal techniques that use the players display so that titles not by that artist are skipped
this capability is useful but is hindered by the fact that it is tied in to the artist mode
the artist mode capability is intended to give you a way to play multiple discs by the same artist with tracks shuffled if you like
you can use it to facilitate finding and selecting discs by a specific artist but as soon as you select an artist different from the one currently playing the disc currently playing stops and the player commences playing the first disc by the other artist that you select
this is aggravating when you want to peruse titles by a few other artists before making your selection
the bottom line is that this player lacks a good way to select a disc by starting with the artist and then perusing the discs by that artisti received the changer as a requested gift to replace a technics slmc which was great btw just not enough capacity
the only improvement in the sony is more discs but the only initially perceived benefit was its ability to play mp discs
this is where the first major problem is the lag time between tracks is huge
playing mixes is incredibly frustrating
even changing from disc to disc is infuriating it takes longer than any changer ive used
also to add discs or even open the door requires stopping the item playing at the time
overall the capacity is impressive but do not purchase this item based on its ability to play mp albumsthe remote has a lot of built in codes and worked well but i stopped using it when i got harmony unfortunately this remote is very bulky and has little memory which limits the learning function severely
it can be programmed over the phone but i have not tried that option
i think more memory for learning ir codes would make it a better product but after trying harmony i am not going back to this remotethis remote may be one of the most versatile youll find
with so many new tvs and formats remotes quickly become outdated
but since this is programmable its just a matter of entering the new codes and youll have a remote capable of dealing with tvs dvds vcrs or whatever else you throw at ithowever those unlucky enough not to have tvs wtih published codes might face some challenges
most of these codes are published on the all for one website which offers the info free for download
not unfrequently however you may be forced to make a telephone call
from there they do their best to look up your media player and provide an accurate code
perhaps the main failin of the all for one is its unability to intelligently look up  codes  a function youd expect from a smart remote
a few other universal remotes have this and their convenience is upped enormouslythis remote uses three aaa batteries its strongly suggested that you convert to rechargeables and simply swap cells once every two weeks or soalthough i havent used all the functions on this remote it is still functional for me
the button layout is only fair and is difficult to switch between this and the comcast remote that my hands are used toafter much online research trying to find a remote to replace two others i settled here
perhaps my equipment is just too old but i could never get codes for my samsung dvdvcr combo to install even from the audio file sent by one for alli bought this remote to replace the remotes for my sony tv phillips dvd player panasonic vcr a fisher stereo system and hopefully a hdtv settop box in the future
ive been able to get it to learn codes to do most of the functions of each component but not without difficulties
first using the learn function is not always successful even though the unit says success its not always true
sometimes it takes two or three tries to get it to work
second some things it just wont learn
it cant seem to learn to switch some of the functions on my fisher stereo
third it didnt take long to use up the learned memory and i still have lots that i want to program into it
i know i can go out and buy a cable and so on but why should i have to do that
i should be able to use whatever memory is available to fully customize it to do what i want it to do
oh well i like a challenge so i will probably end up with the cable and software somedayi like the feel of the remote the buttons have a quality feel to them plus the remote has a solid feel since it is a little on the heavy side not an issue unless your toddler throws it at your head like mine does
its also durable and has survived a few drops and throwspricewise its a good buy even at full price
lots of features for the moneymost liked feature buttons light up though i wish they were green or blue not redleast liked feature not enough memory availablethe urc  universal remote control works fine but working with the buttons is a pain especially the power button
it is too easy to turn off the device you are working with
a bit on the heavy side as well but as a urc it serves its purposethe macro feature seems cool havent figured it out yet
no page down button for digital cable guide but i bet i can custom program a button to do it
cheap price great company i expect it will perform more as i use it more
very eay to program doesnt work with direct tv with tivo you need a upgrade
works very well else wisethough it has an lcd window the buttons are far too similar with small print no backlight on the lcd so its hard to read and doesnt really display much of use
better off getting a cheaper model thats easier to usenot bad for the price
its a remotenice feature
but battery drains too fast
programming the macros can be trickythe remote overall seems to work
it was difficult to find codes to work my amplifier however the amp is  years old backup amp for whole house system
one for all did respond rapidly happily and succinctly to my problem
after code uploads via phone and computer  very easy were executed the th code did operate my system in the majority
but  i specifically wanted the remote for the rf capability
i could only get the rf remote to work well at  feet and intermittently at  feet
i really needed at least  feet i used new batteries and changed the position of the receiver
it is possible my home has too much interference and it does have metal studs in the walls
so the upshot is i returned the remotei got this remote and was able to get all my devices to work but factory remotes have buttons with different funcctions and while you can learn a few keys lack of namming on an lcd really limits useability
to contrast i eventualy got a urc rfsurc rfs powerpak bundle w mastercontrol rf and powerblasterfor about double the price and have about  or more lcd named programmed functions for every device
the first  i programmed and nammed on each device are to turn its necessary companion devices on and to right setting such as on dvd i have tvpwrtv powerhdmitv to hdmistpwrstereo powerstimpstereo imput to dvd
the next set of screens have those wierd functions programmed in that only original remotes usually have
macros usually end up off so i prefer a simple layout like this just click them  in order
once you have a better remote like the urc rfs you really know what your missing and even though urc  gets the job done no namming and less programability makes it hard to use and less classyjust bought one from local store for  after rebates
the web setup is easy
i hooked it up with a win pc and a winxp notebook
both works
the dhcp took a minute to obtain the ip address from the router
so be patient the first time you hook it up
port  worked for an hour and failed
i think its the connector problem
i think there is a quality issueok so i was tired of having to sign off ps online in order to chat with friends so i made what i perceived to be an investment in order to get the best of both worlds
i went along with advice from others and abstained from the wireless routers and i noticed that a particular router the dlink di was on sale
i went ahead and bought it and tried installing it on my computer
now the hassle that i needed software installed and everything
i assumed that i just needed to plug in the cat cables into the router connect a few other cables and bam im done
but no in addition to that i must install software onto my computer which turned out to be a nightmare
i needed to figure out the ip address of my ps which took hours and i had to search through at least  website forums in order to get advice because dlinks advice proved useless
alhough i must say that the dlink customer service is very fast and attentive they simply couldnt solve my problems
so i finally managed to install it and worked correctly after about  hours of constant work
but i must say it works like a charm now and id hate to see what hassles a wireless router bring
please follow my advice and have a computer expert install this for you
if youre simply using it for multiple computers it shouldnt be too hard though
just be carefulthank younot sure what im doing wrong
there is no software that i can see to download
it came wo any paperwork or directions
these days thats not a huge deali can now use computer in a number of rooms
but cant use them fully at the same time
if its just info  emails probably
but movie streaming is interrupted if someone gets on another computerfor the price this router seems like a good value buy especially if you dont need wireless why have wireless if you dont use it
and with a rebate its even a better deali would recommend it over linksys however the user interface on linksys is much easier to use
the interface for configuring the firewall options on this dlink is very confusing
you cant just turn the firewall on for certain common ports but rather you have to specify the entire range of ip addresses you want it to effect and its not very user friendly at allalthough this camera is cheap it should be
pictures require a great deal of light and then tend to be very contrasty too bright in sun areas and too dark in shade
movies are better than still pictures
it is easy to carry but eats up batteries very fast
i use rechargeables but after  pictures and two  sec
movies on a fresh set i got a low battery warning
i have owned about  digital cameras over the past  years and this is the worst by far
it is about the quality of most camera phones if that good
the oregon scientific and the logitech took much better pictures and took them in much lower light conditions
i bought the refub model for less than the price here and it came with all the extrasupdate i have taken another two dozen pictures in good light and the pictures are better than the first batch
in fact i compared them to those of my kodak from  with the same resolution but  and they are nearly identical so i must conclude that cameras with this resolution take the same quality pictures or nearly so so it is really a four star for the price
converting the pictures to black and white in picassa  or other software produces very good bw pictures surprisingly goodi think this is a simple case of deciding what you want
the aiptek camera tries to cater to consumers that dont know what they want
its an adequate webcam an adequate take anywhere digital camera for very small photos or large web pictures for your website or online auctions and an adequate camera for taking small movies
but with that said the camera does not excel in any areaswebcam  the actual quality is very nice when compared to some other usb webcams but it is more expensive and it can be powered by the usb connection
but there are some problems with yahoo messenger so if you want to use yahoo with this webcam beware there may be some minor hiccups
it comes with a decent stand but the base sometimes will give way to the rigidity of the usb cord and will tend to pull the camera over
the webmovies are almost unusable
apparently this camera uses some kind of little used codec that most people dont have unless they have the aiptek software so dont count on sharing small webmovies with other peoplelike all cameras of this sort low light is its mortal enemydigital camera the camera msrp is about 
there are some cheap sub  cameras that are  megapixels
i know i personally saw a  megapixel camera from kodak for 
so is it really worth it to buy this camera for  megapixel resolution
on the plus side the camera does offer a macro mode which i have used to varying success for taking pictures for online auctions and this camera does have the advantage of being very small if you are a spy or something
also i found the memory adequate if not robust
in all probability you will not be taking many pictures with this camera anywaysbattery life  if this is mainly a webcam the battery life really doesnt matter since it is powered by usb
but if you use this for a camera i found that the camera will last a few days of sporadic phototaking
purchase of rechargable batteries are recommendedsummary my recommendation is to know what you want
do you want a webcam or a small digital camera
if you must have both and you cant afford to spend a little extra to buy both then the aiptek camera is an adequate compromisestill picture quality is equivalent to  disposable cameras from   just remember that a  megapixel digital camera was  in still photos are x and can be downloaded in linux but video can only be downloaded and decoded in windows
not a big problem because it only records  seconds of video at x fps
can be powered off usb or internal aaa batteries
has auto shutoff when running on batteries but stays on when powered by usbstill photos are stored in flash
video is stored in sdram so you need those aaa batteries to keep your videos from getting erasedvery flimsy like all chinese products
different icons on the lcd panel wink off if you squeeze the casenot as small as it looks in the picture
really  deep
very light howeveri use this to charge batteries for my canon s
i feel this is one of the shortcuts canon took on an otherwise awsome line of cameras
yes it works and ive never had any major problems with it but its made of clunky plastic is just about as big as the camera and just feels tacky
on the upside the electrical plug folds into itself to provide ease of portability which is a very nice feature
have not figured out why but sometimes when its charging batteries it makes a humming noise
but its reliable
mine is going on  years and still works fineowned for  months
good customer support until they agreed i needed an rma  and then they stopped talking to me
had to tweak them twice to get it
received new unit after three weeksgood sound and volume if encoded at higher rates
the mb expandability is good especially since the cards are finally getting cheapernot for the heavy exerciser who sweats a lot
the clip is almost useless except for walkers
when held in hand or against the skin the sweat gets into the player and shorts itgood survivability
dropped a couple of times with no subsequent problem
one potential problem is the battery cover
it is flimsy and does not stay on the player when changing the battery
there is a good chance of losing it especially when dropping it because it flies offthe software is kludgy
it has a tendency of locking up my computer
there are some directories that were created by mistake that i cant get rid of
the good part about it is that it encodes mps and wmas very quicklymy husband bought nomad ii c for my birthday because he knows i like music and want to have something to listen to while jogging
however it froze a couple of times during the first week
so i returned it and bought a iriver slimx imp and i am happy with my decisionpros about nomad ii c small light using memory wont skip have a clock have recording capability use one aa batterycons it has limited capacity even with  mb
for people like me who has lot of discs and likes to listen to a variety of music it is not very convenient to tranfer files constantly feels cheap to view time you have to navigate and push the buttons several timesmy point is it maybe good for some people but not everybodyi find that this little player has great sound quality and is fairly simple to use
however as soon as i installed the software i had to update it
i also had to update the firmware
i bought this to send to my boyfriend in iraq with the intention of continuing to send him new music during the time he is on active duty
the mp player had to have no moving parts because of the sand storms
however when i received the player installed everything and copied music to the smart card using a smart card readerwriter the player would not recognize the songs even though they would play on the computer
it turns out that the software puts a hidden file on the smart card so that the player knows that the card was copied to when in the player
this means that the music must be copied directly to the player itself which would not be in the country
this is a severe issue for those who will not have direct access to the player when copying songs
i highly recommend a different brand for those peopleone of the drawbacks of amazon is returning marginal items and this is one of those
i bought a nikon binocular which i really like to replace my older brunton binoculars and i bought this harness for the nikon
but i liked my cabelas camo harness for the brunton so much i swapped it off and never used the nikon harness so this nikon harness has just been sitting in the boxi got the harness and found the little plastic bag
instead of metal rings it had four sort of tshaped tabs
i couldnt figure it out so used short strips of nylon cord to make the connection
absolutely no help from amazon or nikon and i checked the nikon site
other than that the harness looks fine and should work like the ones we got from mass audobon some years backfor a stereo pair of computer speakers these arent too bad which is rarely the case with bose but we wont let my opinion of the company get in the way with my opinion of the product
they do indeed sound quite decent for a fairly small set of computer speakers
bass is present unlike most small speakers and they have a reasonably full soundthey also have a nifty feature that some people might put to great use  they have  audio inputs and can actually mix them together and you can control the volume levels of both of them which is as far as i know a unique feature to computer speakers
this is nifty because you could do something like run your tvs audio output into them while having the computer plugged into them too so you get somewhat better sound than cheap tv speakers and can still hear the sound from the computerthe problem is for the price you can get significantly better sound with some monsoons or other similar computer speakers which not only sound a bit better in the mids and treble they also include small subwoofers that handle bass better than the mediamatesoverall these arent a great deal for most people but if you are looking for a powered stereo pair of speakers and plan on using the mixer feature they are your only choice
if you dont plan on using the mixer feature i reccomend you compare them to other speakers in the price range especially if you have the room for a small subwooferas far as i can tell this only works with windows and it doesnt have much support documentation
i bought one to be able to run to my ps and i couldnt ever get it to work
i am no genius but i consider myself pretty technical and this was just not straightforward
linksys you can do better than thispurchased this for action replay and its not compatible
use it for other things so nbd
live and learn
loleasy to install in a dual g power mac no drivers required
the card works fine with os  but the computer will not go into sleep mode if a disk drive is connected to this card including ipods
the drives will sleep but not the mac
the computer will sleep fine if my scanner card reader without card and ir remote are plugged into this card
also if you plug your keyboard into the card you cant wake the computer because the card is sleeping
i checked the ads website and there are no fixes for the sleep issues
if you can work around the quirks the card does workthis usb  card was purchased because i have an older pc with usb  ports and needed  for my new mp player
since it has so many ports and i only needed  i figured id used another port for another use
it turns out i have a microsoft wireless keyboardmouse setup
the receiver is a usb unit
naturally i thought id use this board for my keyboard  mouse
after i installed this card everytime i powerup i get a messaged from windows saying that the os didnt find my keyboard
it then boots and finds both keyboard  mouse both work through one receiver
now once the pc is booted and up the mp player and software work just fine
so the problems only occur during boot time and then go awaygood functional keyboard not the  easiest to type on nothing compared to a wireless microsoft keyboard but acceptable
easy to store and carry aroundi had bought this as a spare keyboard for my laptop
it may be slightly better for typing on than the laptop keyboard but i cannot touch type on it
the keys are not very responsive
they kind of wiggle so its difficult to judge when youve actually depressed the key
perfect for throwing into your laptop bag or for a hostile or wet environment repair shop garage etc
otherwise passi bought this keyboard for the same reason as others  to make more room to the right so i dont have to reach as far for the mouse
this keyboard works fine but it takes more effort to press the keys
i gave myself a month to get used to this but i never did
i consistently have more typos than i did previously
i finally went back to my old keyboard and im reaching again
heres a tip to find more keyboard alternatives  search on lefthanded keyboard
these have the key pad on the left
i wish i had thought of this earlier because i could have found another keyboard that was almost identical to my old favorite keyboard
sighi got this keyboard because it was recommended particularly by people who have pain in their shoulder from having the mouse too far away
whats nice is theres no number keypad on the side it enables the mouse to be much closer to the keyboard and therefore my body
this combined with a few other ergonomic changes have made the pain go awaythat said theres one minor downside and one major downside
the minor one is that for me is that it takes a little more effort to press down on the keys than im used to  so sometimes my fingers get tired from typing so much
to be fair though im on the computer  hours a day  so for the average computer user it probably isnt an issueafter using it for a year one major downside is that the little plastic things underneath the keys keep breaking
at least once a month it seems a key stops working so i have to take off the key stick some tissue paper inside the key put it back on and then it works againtheres clearly a serious quality control issue with the keys on these keyboardsfinal takedefinitely recommended for anybody who needs to get rid of the number keys to bring the mouse closer to their keyboard
just be sure you know how to remove and replace keysi would have given it a  star if the keyboard can lay downflat as mentioned by another reviewer here beforegreat product works as expected but creates lots of shadows on the screen that are not there when plugged in directly so they are artifacts from the switch boxi purchased this because the builtin ethernet port on an older imac failed
i was surprised when it arrived because the cd said it had macintosh drivers that should have worked with the imac in questions hardware software etc
met the requirements
however the device would not connect to the internet although the computer saw the device
i installed the free drivers from  and then it worked instantly
the hardware itself seems to be working fine but i lost an hour of my life trying to make dlinks drivers workbottom line  buy one for your mac if you need it price and hw specs are good but just use the free driver and ignore the dlink cdit seems like a good product now that i have it up and running
ive been on wireless the past few months because my network card stopped responding and with this product my connection is noticeably a lot more stable and fasteri almost returned the product however because i could not get the driver to install
i tried on  different relatively new laptops two of which are toshibas and one of which is a dell  all running windows xp
as soon as you plug it in it is recognized but if you try to install the driver from the cd as suggested it does not work
it says the driver is missing or corrupt
i tried pointing it to the actual file but that did not work either by the way the manual is garbage  whoever typed it up never actually tested what they wrote
there are spaces missing in file destination pathsi got it working after going to the dlink website and downloading the driver there and pointing to the specific file myselfkind of a hassle for me it might be for you as well so be wary of thaton a better note though amazoncom is great
i ordered late on a sunday night  monday was a national holiday columbus day and i received it late tuesday afternoon
it wasnt supposed to arrive until next monday with the free shipping i selected but it only took a day and a halfi have this plugged into both a pc for media access and the wallwart power sometimes the highamp ports do not seem to keep my phone charging overnight when the pc goes to sleep
odd since it is powered
only happens few times a monthi have a laptop without ps ports so i needed a usb hub to connect an external keyboard ms natural elite and mouse ms optical wheel mouse
unfortunately the mouse freezes for a complete second during high cpu times about every  minutes
i bought a much smaller siig usb  mobilenotebook hub not the quotmini hubquot one which is bigger and it doesnt have these problems
with the siig you dont have to use the ac adapter unlike the dlinkhaving owned  of these units for more than  years now i am finally ready to review this
my config link two of the same hubspros
very cool looking hub
no overheats no matter how many devices of different types are doing transfers
i have done as much as  usb thumbdrives  full transfers at once before
great for devices that doesnt require high speed scanners security dongle keys controllers
one very tough hub
in the past i have had hubs that occasionally act up with out of control lights etc
this one is consistently in the same mood every day
very lightcons
when any usb  device is plugged into the hub it runs everything at usb  speed
doesnt matter the order
even when  usb hubs are connected to one another the speed of both hubs will drop as soon as something usb  is plugged in
doesnt matter which port on which hub
even when running at usb  speed it cannot match regular usb  data transfer speed of you plugging a device directly into the motherboard ports
for some reason western digital mybook storage devices really struggle with this hub
it maybe just my storage devicei replaced an old usb hub with this new one expecting more power with the new  hubs
i was not able to run my usb scanner from this new hub
it is only useful for small items like mice keyboards and mp players
it is not a bad product just dont expect to run everything you buy for itnot much to say as a hub  does exactly what it says on the tin
got it running on a macbook laptop without ac power without any problemsonly think to watch is those fast charge ports  they only work when the hub is disconnected from the laptop or the laptop is off which seems pretty pointless to mei accidentally switched the power brick between this v and my dlink router v which ruined the usb hub and a keyboardmouse connected to itwhy am i telling you this
because this device has no on board regulator it passes whatever voltage comes from the brick directly on to your usb devices
usb spec states that devices should be able to tolerate up to v but as i have found first hand that isnt always the casea regulator that accepts a wide range of input voltages and outputs a steady v is extremely inexpensive and dlink would have been wise to add that to this device to make it more robusti like the build quality and number of ports
the last few usb hubs i bought would become flaky after a few monthsi have two problems with the highpower ports
the software you have to install to make the hipower ports work will ask for admin privileges every time you reboot your computer
i have no idea why or how to make it stop
the high power ports would only turn up the power if you unplugged the hub from the computer
weird
from what i read the software you install is supposed to allow this to happen automatically but it never didso it is a nice nub but that highpower feature is a total fail and why i give it  stars and not it works with my epson scanner but my canon i printer didnt like it
computer didnt have a clue the printer was turned on
however i dont know if that is an issue with this hub or the printer
the printer works fine plugged directly into my computer thougha word of warning this may work well with pcs but perhaps not with macs running the latest version of lion
it was ok with os x  but it caused kernel panics in lion 
i had to buy a new hub that was compatible a tripp lite ur usb  hispeed hub from amazon
there is some blame attributable to the apple software upgradeit does the job of providing the extra usb ports where needed acts like a multioutlet extension cordhowever the special powered port for charging a phone did nothing at all
no better than a regular usb portthis dlink  port hub works fine for peripherals like external hard drives your phone etc it seems to have quite a lot of power
tested with two portable hdds usb powered iphone and amazon kindle
everything worked simultaneouslythe hub does not work well with keyboard  mouse on my macbooki can not wake the computer using my keyboard and mouse when plugged in through the hub
the devices take about  seconds to start working after the computer is awoken using the builtin laptop keyboardmy solution is to plug the keyboard directly into the laptop and my mouse into the keyboard
but this solution may not work for everybodyin all the hub functions as i need it to
but beware of this limitation on mac computers
there are many forum posts about this if you google dlink mac wake from sleepi bought this hub to use with my external hard drivesthe hub provides poor performance in usb  mode with hard drives
the max i get usually is mbps through this hub
plugged directly into the same port gets me closer to mbpsthere are also multiple disconnects where the hub just drops out and reconnects
i then get messages in windows about this device may perform faster the usb  in  port messagethere are  ports but id avoid using hard drives or ready boost usb flash drives
the chance of a disconnect is too high and could cause data corruptionthe usb hub is fineit is a usb hub so how great or bad can it be
it works with all of my devices and its smalllike every other usb hub i have ever boughthowever dlink did not honor my rebate
unlike the other poster who got a phone number to call i only got a card in the mail with an address stating that i need to resubmit
i sent them a letter explaining that amazon is not excluded on their form some retailers are and showing them a printout of the amazon page with a link to the rebate formit has been about  month since i did that and they have not replied
i am not keeping my hopes up about that this was my st hub i purchase for mining bitcoin
it was soon discovered that this hub did not work for me as i would have intermittent issues with my usb asic erupters
after a few hours of hashing away they would generate hardware errors and ultimately stop mining indicated with a solid green led light on the erupted
i decided to purchase x  port usb hubs as recommended by a lot of users in forums
the st hub was a  port usb  anker hub and the nd was a  port usb  rosewill hub
both work great and havent given my any issues at all
as a matter of fact they have been running for about  months nonstopits no big deal to keep resetting the password in order to get wifi working but its a nuisance
more problematical having to put in my own password manually means i have to use a less randomized easily remembered password instead of using the highly randomized passwords provided by the internal firmwarei havent looked very deeply into the problem  there may be a simple fix id find if i rtfm  but its not that great a hassle
it doesnt drop connections or slow down available bandwidth so ill give it  starsthis works well as a port usb hub  powered ports and  others all usb   however in my dell laptop it seems to make the laptop crash at bootup to a blue screen everytime that it detects that this device is plugged ini bought one of these hubs in dec  and it has worked flawlessly since then
recently i bought a nd hub for another location
it looks and performs identically to the older hub
i use it with a usbpowered external hard drive an iphone  digital camera keyboard and mouse
the older hub is connected to a pc the newer one to a mac mini
both the iphone and external hard drive draw significant amounts of power but the external transformer supplies plenty of juicethe product description says the hub will work when selfpowered but i always use it with the external transformermy only complaint is that the external transformer is kind of large so it may cover adjacent plugs when plugged into a power stripupdate may   i just upgraded my mac mini to an imac and the hub has problems with it
after the imac comes out of standby devices connected to the hub are disconnected or hung
you can see in apples discussion forums that this is a common problem with the dlink hub on imac and macbook
so if you are looking for a usb hub for a mac stick to the brands sold in apples storei received mine in the mail today
i am using a win os
the hub is supposed to be pp
when i plugged it into the back of the computer in one of the  usb slots  the system was having problems loading the drivers
after  minutes of plugging and unplugging
i had to revert to my mini hub i use for my laptop so i could go to the company website and look for drivers
nothing
my hardware vs is c
nothing like that exists on the company web site
so i called tech support
the person on the end after a couple of holds finally came back and said there are no drivers for my modelserial number
really
no drivers
she advised to return it to amazon for an exchange
after i hung up i plugged the hub into a usb port on the front of the computer dell tower
the hub installed
then plugged in each accessory ie
mouse keyboard and a couple of other items
i plugged each one and waited for the message that the item had installed successfully
each item worked
so i pulled the hub out and plugged it into the back of the computer
i removed the accessories from the hub before i inserted  the plug to the back usb slot
it installed
the accessories installed and are working
however this device should have worked right out of the box
i have  years experience working with and supporting other people with computers and software
while i have two older dlink seven port hubs i never had a problem until today
if the company does not have drivers for the hardware they need to pull it from the market until they can support it
i am giving it a three at bestits really a trend with pcs these days but the blue leds on this are bright enough to completely light up my home office
i ended up using electrical tape to cover themit works for charging android phones and tablets
after the new ios update it also works for the ipad min and iphone  before the update it would not charge them
it will not charge the ps dualshock  controllerit seems to make no difference which ports are used
if a device wont charge on the regular port it also wont charge on the high current portbasically a good product i would have like more juice per channel to power usb  inch external drives  for lap topsworked well for almost  years but then the power supply failed
at first it was intermittenti could get it to work by tapping it lightly
then i powered it down one day and it wouldnt come back to life when i powered it up againthree stars is about as much as i would give a hub
theres nothing wrong with it
in fact it works well
i just cant get my shorts in a twist over a hubpros enough power for large thumb drivespower chord designed to take up only one slot on power stripdoes not run hotseven ports are better than transfer seems fairly speedycons  why doesnt a usb provider make a hub with screw holes to attach it to a top or side surfaceparallel ports are closely spaced too close for some drives and  dongles
youd think that after figuring out the plug issue theyd also realize that not all usb devices are slender
that removes the usefulness of a port or twocomputer cable and power chord in smack dab in center which makes desk placement difficultstill its probably the most practical hub on the market in the price rangethis is a great product but it has very limited in power
i noticed that if i connected too many high powered devices such as hard drives everything slows down
sometimes i lose lower to my external hard drives
if i use this product for usb keys keyboard or just charging then its okay
im not sure how many volts each port carries but its not enough to use with multiple hard drivesi had to send it back because for me it didnt work
i thought it was my machine but once i took the hub off i got rid of my problemstitle says it all
at least on my  port unit
from the start the ports were loose and you have to move the cable to make a connection even when plugged all the way in
when it works it works good other than the port connectioni was using this with a linux laptop and for some reason it was interfering with the keyboard at start up
i purchased this to use with my raspberry pi but also purchased a sainsmart expansion board that added to the usb count and powered the unit
i thought my laptop was fried and never thought the hub could be the problem unplugged everything and the laptop worked fine
i havent used this with windowsdoes not charge my ipad mini  or any tablets i have with any of the ports including the  supposed higher output portswe use several of the bluish ones since years as the current image isthese felt stable and durable
zero problems great qualitythe new one arrived this week it is black and the enclosure feels kind of cheap
my initial thought was i send it back not fully decided yetso far we have nothing than good results with the old versioni wish that amazon would update the imagesedit i kept the new version and it is working just fine i have four disks on it and two card readers
i work with it  days  hours with it
no problempro with the rebate this is an excellent price for a usb  hub
ive had up to  usb  devices connected to it without any problems
ive had it for almost a yearcon does not work well with usb  devices
i connected a usb  scanner to the hub
for about one out of every  scans the scanner will lock up and i have to reboot the pc to restart it
if i connect the usb  scanner through a usb  hub then it locks up about once every  scans
in any case all the usb devices slow down significantly when the usb  scanner was connected  it didnt matter whether or not i was using the scanner
my usb  printer also causes the slowdown
my solution was to wire my usb  hub directly to my pc and have it only drive my usb  devicesas a side note disconnecting the usb  device while the pc was on did not improve the speed
the usb  device had to be disconnected before the pc is powered on to get maximum speedworks well with keyboards but not very well with cell phones very difficult to link updevice has not been updated for windows vista
worst purchase i have made so far have set aside not using anymore customer support from manufacturer not good at allneither the cd that it comes with nor the dlink website has vista drivers
you either have to use bluesoliel  on a trial version and have data transfer limited or purchase iti use this with a  year old powerbook g that came without bluetooth
i plug it in and mac os x recognizes it
it works fine since
however this adapter only supports older bluetooth standard so file transfer is slow peaking at kbsthis item did not work on my hp laptop
it did work on my wifes toshiba laptop
worked well when it worked
could have been an issue with my laptop my usb ports are usb  not   wouldnt think that would matter but who knowsthis product works great with my logitech bluetooth mouse
i didnt even install any software my laptop came with windows vista and toshiba bluetooth stacki plugged it in and didnt need to install any drivers
it found my mouse right away
i can unplug it and plug it back in and it immediately is configured no messing around with waiting for it to find the device again etcthe only cons are that this does not support adp audio streaming
per an email from their tech support i finally got back today
i wanted to get some headphones to listen to my laptop but all the headphone reviews say that if you dont have adp then it will sound tinny
so minus  stars
and i wish id gotten a pcmcia adapter so i dont worry about busting this dongletype device offotherwise it works just as it should and im pretty happy with it i just need to upgrade to a newer one i guessi gave it  stars because the only problem with it is crappy documentation
the device itself works flawlessly and i give that  stars
i have a vista machine and i was having problems like others mentioned however the fixed proved surprisingly easy
i uninstalled all the crap the disc installed on my pcworks flawlessly ever since connected a bluetooth logitech mediaboard pro and a cellphone and it works greatso for any others who cant get it working on vista do yourself a favor and throw the manual and the disc out and trust vista to install it and set the bluetooth for discoverable modethis mouse use to work well back in the day  but now the newer mice have improved laser technology over these mice with the newer mouse pads
it was good in its hay day but it has expired unfortunatelyas the price would suggest this mouse in nothing special
it gets the job done but thats about all you can say for it
of course were talking about a mouse here so it doesnt really need to do anything special except point where you direct it toi found one annoying design element this mouse has extremely loose action on the scroll wheel
if you like some feedback from your mouse scroll wheel stay away from this modelreview date   have had two in our household
each functioned flawlessly for approximately  hours  months at  hours per day
left mouse button becomes unresponsive requiring the user to press excessively hard andor repeatedly to get a response
only gets worse with time
when shopping for a replacement the second time around i found reviews at other sites where others complained of the same problem
my conclusion is that the microsoft wheel optical mouse is no more dependable than a  mousei got this mouse on sale over a year ago and its workedflawlessly with two different windows se systems connectedthrough the mouse port
ive had no problems with it atall
smooth scrolling decent with fps games
all in allits a good dealthis mouse is good not nearly perfect though
if you are on a budget grab this mouse you wont be sorry
if you have the money though go get the intellimouse explorer wireless it is much more comfortable than this mouse it also has the extra buttons on the side
overall a good mouse
much better than anything logitech can throw at iti purchased this in order to repair my wifes ailing pc when the old one died but i found out after installing what i thought was the exact replacement that it wouldnt communicate with the motherboard as it was a switching power supply that had separate v power for the newer multicore processors
even though it had the exact model number as its predecessor
its a decent basic power supply but if you are only replaceing a blown older ps be forewarned  this may not wont work with your older mb
it ended up that i decided to upgrade the rest of the computer as a result which ended up being a good thing if a little more expensive than i intendedi can understand having a charger for a laptop but this i dont quite understand at least not for this price
i would highly suggest getting some  good rechargeable batteries powerex or eneloop and a good charger maha or la crosse
right now im charging the batteries energizer for my camera and all my other batteries are in use
i figured that getting the adapter would be useful but now that ive seen the price i have to reconsider
im just going to buy eight rechargeable batteries
that way ill always have a charged set i can use them for other purposes should the need arisethey are decent but they are pretty thin and tear really easily
once you get them on and leave them alone they are ok if you can get them on without tearingi read previous reviews and decide to give it a try see if it fits my earphone
turns out the outside diameter is mm
inner circle is mm
too big for me earphones
product quality looks ok but i cant use themit may be good for others but not for my wife
when she has her earphones on listing to her tv she did not hear the phone ringing
due to her limit visibility she did not notice the read light
but at that low price it is well worth giving it a go to see if it works for younot as loud as some people say as a matter of fact  my att phones ring louder some people out here have really exaggerated the loudness of this  ringer i hear my phones over this ringerit appears to be a little on the cheap
when i opened the box the ringer was light meaning not enough wire coil to ring loud
sure enough it is not loud enough on high
not any louder than a normal bell phone on low only old people remember those bell ringers
i wanted this one in the bedroom hoping i could hear it in the adjoining bathroom
alasno
for comparisoni have radio shack ringer on the other end of the house it makes you jump in any other rooms except the far end bedroom
based on cheapness and no loudness it gets a the writeup states extra loud ringer
i was somewhat dissapointed
many telephone ringers are as load
but especially during night the builtin flasher should help
price was more that reasonable but had i heard this i may have researched other ringers before purchasingi got a couple of these for staff members who use a polycom soundpoint ip  hd voip phones and while you can hear perfectly you will sound a lot quieter to the person you are talking to
we tried all settings on the phone and they all were basically the same
i guess with an external amplifier it may work betteri like  need hands free for my cell phonei have used several high end blue tooth hands free
none has worked well for methis is my last try with plantronicsthis latest purchase  has worked well for two  weeksi have had two  plantronics mxc  both of which failed  and plantronics has declined to replace either
although purchased from amazon i was unable to satisfy planttonics
 warning  plantronics has putrid customer supportif your plantronics device fails  plantronics will stiff youemail me if you know a better wired headset for cell phonesfirst of all i must start out by saying that i am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days
the hl is kind of a throw back to the seventies in terms of its jerry rigging function
having said this plantronics builds quality stuff and i am sure that there is a good reason for it
the device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone
i was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup
i am using it with a plantronics csn headset  which i love for it professional wireless function
i tested the hl by picking uphanging up the headset  times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time
that was good enough for me
definitely worth the  if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the houseoffice while talking on the phoneive had this for over a year now and it was relatively easy to install
i dont like the idea that i had to stick it to my current phone so if i want to change phones ill have to find a way to unstick the very well stuckon lifterhowever its amazing to hear it working from my basement to the nd floor of my housesometimes it overshoots when hanging up the phone and i have to adjust the lifter againeven though it was working fine for days before thatoverally pretty decent  surprised at how well it works in such a technodriven society  that such a simple concept actually does the jobi like it and would recommend it to otherslike so many others i have had this modem for  years now
it was very good for about  years with only occasionally drops requiring resetting
now it drops data constantly and i am shopping for a new modem and it wont be a toshibajust installed this but had to do it in a roundabout way
first off the modem has big warning signs not to connect any cables until the software tells you to
ok fine
i pop in the cd it goes through the instructions
it does tell you to plug in the ac adapter into the back of the modem
it doesnt tell you when to plug it into an electrical outlet
by the time it starts trying to detect the modem and fails obviously i figure i better plug it into the walleven with the modem plugged in the software cant detect the modem if youre running through a router
doesnt seem to need the drivers at least if youre running through an ethernet card
the installation troubleshooting guide was no help
i gave up on the software running in circles and exited
in spite of all this it still worked once i gave the cable company my mac id
software still cant detect the modem though
heres the strange part
ive been running speedtests on two different computers
the win computer that the modem is directly connected to runs really really slow and doesnt come near my mb connection
my other winxp computer that is networked through a wireless router gets nice mb transfer rates off this same modem
go figurei cant speculate on why one computer runs slow and another runs fast but i can say i had a motorola surfboard sb before this and i didnt have these problems even when running through a routerit depends what you care
i dont feel bad even it is most of the time quite light for the ink but it is sure good enough for me clean and flush to the dvds surfaceseldom flacking out to my usage
if i need to pay for the pens shipping i will not buy it againi bought it to label cds because sharpies sanford tm is vivid dominant but risky ruining your data over times if you use it on the cd data area
i recently tried a tdk brand and it was much solid vivid and sloppier inks
it is like you compare your friends note in high school with different styles of writing preferences
they both tdk and memorex are good to me
you pick what you care and what you want
three stars are good because most selections for this kind of pen suck
pricey and not creative so we happily have to live with it
they dont bother develop good productswell its just a pen tool
for gifts or important projects i opt for cd label printout or lightscribe cdscant give much information on this as there has been no real thunder storms in my area giving it  stars at this pointthe product is ok but it partially blocks the other free plug on the outlet
no big deal most of the time just be awarei was hoping for a compact travel surge protector
this is certainly smaller than a power strip but because the prongs dont fold down it hasnt stayed in my backpack
it is thicker than my laptop and thicker than my acdc converter the brick that comes with the laptop
it probably works fine but because i expected something smaller it doesnt go anywhere with me
and yes it does block the second socket of an electrical outlet
even when plugged into the lower socketi wish it did not prevent plugging in a second cordmodule on a dual outletim sure they are working to protect my equipment but it hogs the power plugs because its so big
cant have all plug ins in use because of it
price was great and the ones i bought are working just fineit works good as it says
we hooked it up to a  amp refrigerator and it is only rated for  amps
do not do this as it made all the items in the fridge go badas a surge protector its working fine
the problem is that its too big to be able to use both outlets on the plug
it doesnt cover the nd plug but takes up all the space in between the two plugs and you cant get another cord plugged into the nd plug
ive tried both positions and the other is worsei used this to protect a sub woofer
works great when you need to protect a single component
the only gripe i have is that its just big enough to make it nearly impossible to use the second plug receptacle on the outletjust like every other plug
a little bit too big for double outlet
so you can use only  outlet at a timei was sent a tripp lite from a client with whom i work so that i could switch between the pc they require me to use and my own
its a temporary fix for a situation that would otherwise force me to purchase an additional and later unwanted monitorneedless to say if your purpose in purchasing this product is simply to switch between monitors it works fine
i hit a it switches to my own desktop computer
i hit b im on my clients machinehaving said that in order to get the monitors display centered on the screen and not missing half of its horizontal picture i must drop my resolution so low that i feel like im working on a dinosaur of a pc with a tube monitor
its an awful pain in the neck to sort through the twelve inch icons labeled with pt font size on my desktop
maybe thats a little bit of a stretch butwellthe resolution capabilities for my hires lcd monitor are significantly higher than the resolution capabilities of this switchso if you simply need to switch between two screens and care nothing for the highest resolution setting buy this
its cheap and it fulfills its purposebut if you like to look at sharp images and dont wish to sacrifice the quality of your images to a cheap vga switch skip thisand just go buy a new monitori got this power strip for my work shop
it seems well made and works as expected
the only issue is it is not a silver color as shown in the product photo but a sort of cream colored metal
i kept it as the color doesnt matter too much to me in a workshop but would be nice if it was as advertisedthis is a high quality power strip however the one i got was a s harvest light green color
hideous
the color was so aweful i had to wip out the spray paint and mask off the outlets and paint it a normal colori gave it  stars since the picture did not describe the product accurately as far as color goesi give it  stars on quality and  stars on value since its a little expensive but hey you get what you pay for
make sure you take the outlet part apart from the main base before punching the punch out hole out i slightly damaged the ground wire by not doing so
oh well nothing a little liquid electrical tape wont fixmust have lost  lbs
since i replaced my other surge protector last night
whats the secretoh look at the design
i wish i had
at the end are three plugs two sideways one atop
i mistakenly thought this was your typical tripp lite sensible design where all the outlets were on top
my badbut that design is why this thing magically melts pounds
see its other outlets are too narrowly spaced to allow those hulky adaptors geeky mindless designers so fondly create  here the only place you can plug in those adaptors is at the end
you are allowed three of themyeah and to figure out how to get those adaptors into the plugs you must contort both body and adaptor
some adaptors work upside down some dont so you must experiment
the sideways design forces an added width of this weird plug to be  inches wider depending on the size of your adaptor one on each side plus a narrower one on the top
god forbid you want to lay it against the wall
for unless you hide it behind a door you will surely trip over the thing since the sideways plugs make it stick out so muchof course the other alternative is to throw out all your electronics with those adaptors
else you have this game of hitandmiss trying to fit one adaptor after the next
if like me you have  adaptors thats a lot of exercise
hence the weight lossfor i at pm last night naively thinking it a minute job sought to replace the old protector  but to get the right combination of plugs in the right places of this one i had to unhook something plugs move my computer towers rethread all cables coming from their backs move the bookshelf behind which some plugs were threaded change my ethernet cables also threaded through that same place and you get the idea
it was midnight before i finishedso im  lbs angrier yet  physical lbs
lighter now
thanks tripp lite
i needed practice using  john  nonstop for three hoursit works properly for now but the onoff rocker switch seems flimsy
i have the feeling this will not last longi bought three of these for various locations throughout the house
i wanted actual surge protection and not just a power strip
after mucho reading of reviews i went with tripp lite
i have some other tripp lite strips at home and they seem durable and nice
and the components inside are allegedly topnotch although i wouldnt personally knowthis is a new style of super
i have an older style super and there are two main differencesthe first is that on the new style the side plugs are closer to the end of the strip
my old style has them smack in the middle
that should not really affect anything at all except for maybe aestheticsthe one major gripe though is the onoff switch
the old style was this strong stiff bulky thing that required work to turn on or off
a good thing considering strips are often in the area of accidental kicks and shoves by ones feetunfortunately the new super features a week onoff switch that can easily and accidentally be turned on or off
you now have to pay special attention to the location of the strip
even my cat could accidentally flip this off
not good when a computer is plugged into ittwo stars off for this new featurenice and compact however the ground portion of the outlets seems really really tight
also the switch feels a bit flimsy so i hope that it will hold upthe outlets dont lock so if you accidentally bump it and the device plugged in has a capacitor box on it it might come out enough to turn the device offi have had no problems with this product
the only improvement i would request is to extend the female housing around the connector so that the connector is not exposedwhile this works fine other sites have similar item far cheaper
yes it works but should cost maybe works for power not for transfer
ive mainly wanted it for charging things at a distance but i was sad to find out it isnt reliable for data transfer
it sometimes works sometimes doesntthe only disadvantage of this product is that it works on v only
if you are traveling to europe or asia this is not the right product for you
it takes five to six hours to recharge the batterieswhats not to like
every startech product ive purchase has lived up to my performance expectations
i expect nothing less than an easy install letting windows  load any needed drivers
purchase this my new computer motherboard didnt come with a port for our hp csimay   update
always had good luck with startech products and given them  star ratings
not this one
installation was easy
however it went downhill from there
on restart the computer saw the card but did not know what to do with it
loaded the cd that came with the card
it is a joke
there are more files with a bunch of information but no i repeat no installation files
went to the startech web site
downloaded azip file that was suppose to have the drivers needed
extracted the files
again no setupinstallation files
if your like me it is very frustrating going through folder after folder looking for installation files that are not there
if there are setupinstallation files startech has them nicely hidden
dont purchase this card and install it in a computer with windows  bit os unless you want alot of frustrationmay  update
received and email from startech
they suggested doing the followingbelow are the steps that need to be taken to install the drivers from our website on a windows  bit machineplease download the drivers for your product using this link when you download files windows usually saves them in the downloads folder which is located under your user name in the users folder on the drive where windows is installed for example cusersyour namedownloadsafter the download is complete extract all of the files
right click the plxpcizip or the plxpciezip file
select extract all
take note of location that files will be extracted to
select extract when complete extracted files will automatically opento open device managero press windows key  ro type  devmgmtmsco click okdriver installation
right click the device which will be indicated with a 
next to it and select update driver
select browse my computer for driver software
select let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer
if a list of hardware types appears leave it set to show all and click next
click the have disk button and browse to the extracted folder open the windows folder and the bit or bit folder based on what system type your computer is and select the file named oxmf or oxpciemf
click ok and then next to install it
repeat steps  for each serial port that appears after the oxmf or oxpciemf driver is installed this time choosing oxpcieser
note to check your system type click start  rightclick computer  propertiessince i already downloaded the zip file i knew where to look for the drivers
following the installation i was able to upload the drivers
however i still could not print a test page
doing a little checking of the printer properties i noticed the drivers i downloaded setup the printer on lpt
my computer was looking for the printer on lpt
once i changed it over everything worked finesent an email back to startech tech support suggestion they get the installation instructions updated and make mention of checking port connection
changed my rating to reflect my feelingsthis cable was not  what i needed
returned it and ordered correct item
if you want to project your laptop to your tv or larger monitor use a dvi to hdmi or usb the cable costs a tenth the price of this cablepainless fast install on pc running windows vista and didnt require any software to do so
pop the card into the slot and vista loaded it immediately
you dont need to use the disk that comes with it which is a good thing
the video editing program included in the box ulead video studio  is very slow and crashed during the final stages of installing itself
i used faster more stable programs  years ago including earlier versions of ulead vs i recommend investing in something better or just sticking with windows movie makerthis card its okay for people how make videos in home or for beginers to start to make editions of videosi installed the device and it shows as com  while my digitizer will address either com  or com   so right now i cannot get the digitizer to work
i have looked at the device manager and cannot find anything about com  through com  although i suspect there is a way
but i have not figured out how to find them just yeti purchase this power supply to replace one that had burned out in an old nearly  years old gateway pc
it lasted a couple of years before burning out but at least by that time the pc needed to be replaced anywayworks but has only one sata plug so beware if you have a modern computer with two or more sata devicesso far so good
i have not had to clean the fans like i did before i got the air filterswitches keyboard video and mouse plus  other usb devices
generally dont have a problem switching between desktop computers but it does have problems with laptops  more than half the time only the video will switch over
i think this relates to the drivers within the laptop but regardless of cause i would not recommend this switch for use with laptops
that being said i am using this to switch a touchscreen monitor between computers which requires both a video path and a usb path from the monitor
this is working great on my desktop computers running windows  and windows this isnt a high performance conductive paste
its slightly better than the stock white heat sink grease but not on a par with the more expensive silver compounds
i am not unhappy with this purchasei certain recommend looking at the quantity of similar items before you buy this one
the amount cannot cover two jobsthis fan is very quiet
replaced a thermaltake fan that was noisywhiney
this one is much quieter
using it as a case exhaust fan
while it is much quieter i am concerned that it is not pushing enough air
doesnt feel like much air is being blown by the fani use this kvm with the power connected but you can also use it on usb power alone
i believe having the power connected to it improves the screen resolution and the usb hub operation but i have not tested this theory extensively
i really like the builtin usb hub for  device
i share a printer between the two computers
the button on the front of it switches from one pc to the other without a problem  and beeps when you switch
the beep is not necessary but its not annoying either
screen resolutions from both computers looks fine most of the time
which leads me to a couple problems ive seen so far sometimes the screen resolution after switching from one pc to the other is fuzzy
switching back and forth seems to fix it
this only happens maybe once in every  switches sometimes the keyboard does not work after switching
again switching back and forth once resolves it
this happens once every  switches or so
i dont know if its my keyboard or not  its a microsoft natural  so it should be pretty standard switching seems to cause the pc you switched from to think you unplugged its keyboard mouse and monitor
this can cause problems if a program is running that requires constant attachment of any of these devices i forget sometimes when printing something on the shared printer
if youre in the middle of printing you cannot switch pcs because the printer becomes unplugged to the pc thats printing and you lose the rest of the documentso a few improvements and i think this switch will be topnotch
until then you may want to look at cheaper ones although there are not many in this price range with the usb hubupdate   i have had some problems where one of the two pcs connected to this switch fails to connect to the mouse and keyboard
the screen shows ok but mouse and keyboard are dead only on the one pc the other still works ok
i have to reboot the one thats not working to get mouse and keyboard functionality back
even plugging them directly into it didnt help
so it may just be the laptop that im using but i though i would mention this issue anywaythe product worked well once we added a hub to it which allowed all of the components to workdefinitely a decent product
it did what we needed it to do
be careful though this wont magically convert your computer image to a highdef image appropriate for a large screen showing
youll for the most part get your computer image at its native resolution up on a screen or tv
in that regard it works quite goodi found it fairly easy to set up despite the instructions being pretty light
the few buttons arent readily obvous as whether they should be in or out for your application
the connections are obvious
hook it up plug it in and it should work
the build quality is a bit light but not bad
the remote works and is fairly useful
i liked the zoom features and the screen adjustment features on the remote
they were quite usefulfor the price i found it to be a decent buyi needed a way to take the vga coming from my computer dvr and send it out to other tvs some being nonhdtvs in various locations in my house
this little device served as half of the solution
it converted the vga signal into a composite video signal that i could run into an older vcr remember the days of recording programs on video tape
that along with the sound coming in from the computer converted the audio and video together into a rf signal on analog channel  that is then sent out to all the other tvs in my house on the same cable that carries the overtheair signals from my three antennas to each set
then each set can choose from the overtheair hd signals or the analog channel  signal being broadcast from my dvr which allows all sets to either watch content of their own choice or the content that is shared to all by the dvr
this little box can even adjust the height and width of the video so that a wide screen hd image can fit on the older nonhd tvs in some of the rooms
the only problem came a little over a year after i had this set up working and this little box lost its mind and started scrambling all the video
it was out of warrenty by then and resetting did nothing to help it get back to functioning
so i repaced it with another even smaller device that performs the same functions just as well  and even cost less
so i give it  stars for working so well for a while but then it stopped workingthe video game jockey works
with this device you can hook up any electronic device that has a composite or svideo output and use it to display on your computer monitor
however its not perfect
this device is ideal for people who dont have access to a television set
if you have access to a television then i recommend you skip this device
mainly because while it works the results arent too greatfirst of all the picture quality is not good
using a composite hookup will cause the picture to flicker and it doesnt look very clear
using an svideo connection will stop the flickering but the sharpness in the picture quality doesnt improve by much
youll have a much clearer picture using the composite and svideo hookups on a television set
another problem is the setting are very limited
you only have the ability to adjust the brightness of the picture
however the setting is very poor and youll have problems getting the picture just right with the monitor settings
either the picture is too bright or its too dark
also the lack of settings like adjusting the color the contrast etc really hurt this devicei also connected my computer through the jockey and the picture quality also takes a hit for the worst
the sharpness isnt as clear as a straight pc to monitor connectionthe only good thing is the status setting which allows you to center the picture on your monitor
i didnt test the sound but judging by other reviews the conversion isnt any good eitherbottomeline i ended up sending this device back
i was looking for something that would let me enjoy my video games and other devices on my monitor and hopefully have a better image experience than whats on my tube television
i wasnt expecting hd but i also wasnt expecting a picture quality far inferior to what you can see on a tube televisionif you dont have a television set but a computer monitor then this device could be great for you
otherwise its not worth the moneyafter reading all the positive reviews i thought this would be a good choice for me
unfortunately i missed the comment that it doesnt work with usb to ps adapters
i have a mouse that has worked with every other kvm switch ive ever seen an older ms optical mouse
it has a usb connector that goes into a ps converterunfortunately it didnt work with this switch so i had to return the item
i havent seen a plain ps mouse in awhile but i havent looked for one eithera quick google shows that theyre still around but i didnt want to buy a new mouse just to use with the switchlcd arrived in big box w other stuff
lcd not enclosed in a little cardboard box as in picture was in thin bubble wrap enclosed in baggie
after install lcd  many dead many pixels  so apparently bad screen or damaged in shipping
when opening ipod it destroys other parts a little more so i decided to keep lcd instead of returning
in ipod little screws which strip a little more plastic which gets bent a little more and various tape glued items
each time you work on ipod fragile items get more damaged
repair job is very difficult so not worth return for new one
amazon authorized a refund but i declined  too much hassle and risk to try repair again
if you buy get  lcds in case one broken
remember this is a difficult repair
careful to not breath broken glass flakes or get cutupdate after one day pixels dying worsened
i may process the refund after allit keeps the cpu cool enough but i was hoping for quieter
i will make some bios adjustments on the next reboot
if it improves then i will update this review and add a starthis is a basic power strip that gives you multioutlet functionality on the cheap
fellowes is a reliable brand name
do not buy this for a surge protector just for switched outletsquite good even though the plug configuration is awkward the distance between each adapter is too little ie
cannot use all of themas ugly in real life as it looks in the picture not worth the extra two outletsusing it but what was i thinkingdoesnt look all that great
while most of us have our power ships hidden away many are still in semi plain site
this product will suit you well if you are one who has it tucked away but if youre like me and its visible it doesnt look all that great with    power bricks attached to it
itd be perfect for cords but the bricks just look that much more unsightlyi love the direct launch buttons
the ball mechanism innards work beautifully when not dirty
i had no complaints other than having to clean it frequently
but it developed a problem common to them and i was no longer able to move the cursor vertically
i followed online blog suggestions
took it apart
cleaned every crevice and cranny twice and reassembled it
didnt work so im opting for the optical version  which we use on another computer
it doesnt have the direct launch buttons but is dirt free and tracks beautifully
the scroll ring works better
sadly i had to throw this one away
great features but seriously flawed when compared with later technology
the kensington orbit optical  is an inexpensive version to consider
moderately priced it is equally smooth and has three functions you can program into iti chuckle a little reading the ten year old reviews on these
at the time a microdrive seemed a good choice compared to compact flashbig flash cards then were mb and the higher cost was offset by the greater data capacitytoday well even gb flash cards are common and microdrives have all but disappeared their last refuge being portable music players and a few camcorderstheres a lot of things that counted against the microdrives they need a type ii slot had a higher power consumption and the firmware of whatever device  they were inserted into had to recognize them
they put out heat and like all hard drives were susceptible to vibration and motion
a rpm spindle meant the data rate was never very good and unlike flash they had to spin up to readwrite while flash went immediatelyso today i wouldnt recommend one at all because of the quirks in using them in addition the market is changing over to the various sd card formats and compact flash really only continues for professional equipmenti didnt realize when i purchased this lock that it didnt have the ability to customize the combination
we have purchased targus defcon locks in the past with this feature and are spoiled by it
i recommend the brand the quality is great
i just wish it had been made a bit more clear that there was another option with this featurei was looking for a laptop lock that i could throw into my laptop bag and take with me wherever i need to secure my macbook pro eg
coffee shops
this more than does the jobi certainly dont worry about theft when its in placebut its longer heavier and more awkward than necessary for my purposesi would recommend this laptop lock for stationary uses securing a laptop to a desk for instance but not to someone looking for security on the goi got this because i often work at home while others are sleeping and i always think it is hot while everyone else is coldas soon as i got this product i was ecstatic
the breeze from the quiet fan was not so strong that it blew away papers on my desk but it made a huge difference
i literally went from sweating to comfortable instantly
as an added bonus the fan was very direct and i could aim it preciselyall this came crashing down though when the fan up and died a month after i got it
it seems to overheat at the usb port and doesnt fit very snuglythe light is nice and usefultheres nothing too fancy about this little hub but it does the job
i thought the blue lights would be exciting but they turned out to be the most annoying feature since i cant get three of them to stop blinking when a device is attached
the manual is sparce and doesnt mention why this happens nor can i find any info on the targus website either
it has a flat side which makes it easy to mount under my work desk and keep clutter down a little
there are better choices out there but i made mine and ill keep it for a whilei got it on special in staples
first one broke after a years use
got another one
its hanging in there after about a year or so
i have my printers keyboardmouse and an external dvd burner plugged into it
so far so good
it may handle an external hard drive but i havent tried that so i cant say for sure
id rather plug something like that directly into the pci know my title is a little clicheacute but that really is how i feel about it
my wife got this dumb pc that doesnt have usb ports on the front and the way we have our pc it really isnt that convenient to get to the back to access the usb ports so i bought this one to run up the front so i dont have to dig in the back every time
it works ok for most items but not one that i really use a lotour portable hard drive
im not sure whymaybe i purchased the wrong product or need a power adapter for it but it wasnt clear to me in the instructions
id probably have given stars if it worked but for this im dinging a couple stars and only giving starsit does not support external hard drives and basically i nedded it to plug  or  hard drives at the same time so  stars is fair enoughwould be great if they actually stuck to anything using the supplied glue
i had to replace the stickypad with epoxy now its not going anywhereive had the targus baseplates before and they are very strong feeling and quite heavy for what they are
these on the other hand do not
they do not feel as strong as the targus version and are likely significantly less secure
they still work though because someone is still going to have to do some damage to remove itthey certainly wont be walking off with itive just joined the z club they survived the infamous  minute blowout rate
i have turned my windows master to  the wav line in and all that stuff i had to turn all the way up
these speakers are just too quiet until i turn it up to  i cant even hear people talk when playing a dvd
for now the speakers are at  bass turned all the way down
the system does sound decent but only when i bump it up to  on the speakers this is supposedly the killer threshold that blows everyones subs up
it looks like its doing ok heat sink is not too warm
my roommate has a set of monsoon mm he abuses them with things turned way high all the time
these z cannot even compete with the output levels of the mm
although if you are willing to try they are supposed to be a few db higher than the mm
i have no idea what everyone is talking about loud about these speakers they produce so little sound my old  cambridges  can out blast these so far
i refuse to turn it all the way up because i really hate dealing with manufacturers
i would recommend these however if you are gentle to them they will work
they give a lot of feedback at higher volumes which is why i am looking for a way to get more volume out of them at lower levels
the sounds is clear and filling the bass is punchy this is because the actual speakers used are overpowered
this means they use speakers at lower wattage rating than the specs the specs are for rms ratings which are for quick bursts and not continuous play
i am no sound expert just your normal college kid so go easy on me if you disagree
the quality of the whole system seems sturdy the control center knobs are loose and wiggly but not a big deal
the main thing i really odnt like is the system has terrible volume setting balances at lower volumes you have no bass at all
i like a system that keeps the sound consistant when changing volumes it only makes sense to have that
no one would want to constantly calibrate the settings to get the preferred sound
anyway i hope they last for years although i havent heard of anyones set surviving for more than a year
if they pop i hope they pop within  days so i can get my money back
it feels nice to have new speakers though so i am going to play with them some more
have fun kidsafter owning  trackballs i was very happy when i found one with the scroll wheel and additional buttons for more functionality
problem is the driver keeps drifting off into space somewhere thus making adjustments on how i use this new trackball rather annoying
ive had to reinstall this driver  times already on my lenovo with an intel i processor gb video card and gb of ddr so i have a hard time believing its my notebook thats the problem here
i dont like the table top antenna and dont understand why it didnt come with a usb plugantenna like most other wireless mice come with
something i have to leave set up in one place all the time i cant say this is a winner but something im learning to live with
sadly enough im still on the hunt for a better trackball that will be a whole lot more portable and easier to use that doesnt have the hit and miss driver problems
as far as design it takes a little while to get use to but as long as you can get the additional buttons to actually work i think its designed pretty well overalli have a basic logitech trackball prior to this one
due to prior experince and satisfaction on their model which i still use for almost two years i decided to upgrade my trackball w more buttons and features for my gaming and multitasking needs
this wireless trackball was the best of choice due to the reviews ive heard here in amazon
upon purchasing it i was very pleased on the comfort and ease of use on most of the buttons
just like any new trackball there arent any universal setups on the buttons layout
so i did have to managed and learn the other button location but it didnt take that longit was an excellent trackball until six months down the line from the date i purchased it
the main button started to acting up
whenever i press it it wont function
i sometimes had to double or even triple click it to make it work
finally it stopped funtioning and i just gave up
im very displeased on the outcome of this item since i was enjoying the ease of all the button functions
not sure if im going to replace w a same one or get another trackballcurrently i had to revert to the original logitech trackball since the other models i like doesnt have the scroll features and the ones that do arent vista compatiblei have always preferred a trackball over a mouse
for one thing i cant use a mouse when using a laptop while seated in a comfortable chair in the living room
a trackball can sit on the arm of the chair
i used macally trackballs for several years
bought a new computer and wanted a new trackball but macally no longer makes them
finally bought the logitechnegativesits made in chinathe wheel is less convenient than the macallywont work with the same wireless receiver as my logitech keyboardno driver for linux to be able to use all the buttonspositivestracks smoothlyits easy to cleanfits my hand fairly well but not as well as the macallyi upgraded to this model after finally having to shelve my logitech trackman marble fx trackballi like this model because it is cordless and has a usb connection
i have larger hands so the size isnt a concern
however i can understand how users with smaller hands would find this design unworkablei dont like optical trackman as much as the aforementioned marble fx because it doesnt stay as clean so the ball jumps and skips it doesnt have the fingerandthumb control of the old version so the movement isnt as precise it isnt durable
ive worn out two models in three years
im on my third and i wont buy another when this one breaksill be looking for a new trackball soon
hopefully logitech will return to formmouse has performed reasonably well
had some issues where the hard to get a signal from the transmitter at some distances if youre looking for a device to control you multimedia center you might want to look at the newer thumball model it has better range
i actually used to like this for a while however i began noticing my pinkie finger getting numb after using the mouse for long periods of time
finally realized that it takes so much pressure to push the left click button that i had to use my pinkie to stabilize the mouseor put a lot of downpressure with my palm to keep the mouse from slidingso the biggest problem is range and takes too much pressuret to click the left click
other than those two issues its a pretty nice trackballbtw i still use this mouse but have moved onto the newer thumb based trackball
never thought id get used to it but now that i have i actually like iti still use this model on some other pcs around the house
i think its fine for light use but extended use will likely cause a problem at least for me it didim a little logitech crazy
i really like the stuff that they make
that being saidthis is not my favorite device
the left button is a bit awkardbut you can reprogram the buttons as you like
i frankly prefer their wired ambidextrous track ball over this
will every now and again i crack it out and use it just for the ergonomic benefits of using different devices
still somehow the ease of this device in combing a usually speed and accuracy just misses the mark
i will keep experimenting with different setting to try and make it more appealing but havent really been happy so farnot sure what others might compare this to but personally this mouse is not at all that precise
it may be fine for general computer use and the extra buttons are great to have but this mouse is not that fine for d software
when it comes to very small movements it lacks the sensitivity needed to make very minute moveslet me give you some background before you read my reviewim in my s
i use computer  hours a day and start developing rsi symptomsi have tried  owned the following trackballslogitech trackman marble fx trackballlogitech optical marble mouselogitech trackman wheel opticallogitech cordless optical trackmanoriginal  buttons kensington expert mousekensington expert mouse prothe logitech cordless optical trackman does not score well in my needs  eliminating  reducing my rsi related painspros wireless good build quality good battery life lots of programmable buttons smooth scrolling trackballcons cannot be used left handed buttons are not located in convenient position cruise buttons scroll wheel are too small awkward position of the forwardback buttonsby far the biggest complaint is the most used left buttonthis key is clicked n times a day so it should be easy to locate and clickinstead this button is concededly smaller than the one in optical marble mouse and trackman wheel opticalalso this button is positioned  degree on the left side of the mouse and it requires some extra effort to click it since you have to hold the trackman in position using your ring and little finger to counter the force you acted on using your thumbconsider this experiment using only your thumbwithout holding the trackman in position and try to left click on it
youll be tempted to secure the trackman using your other fingers
if you have to repeatedly do this your muscle will be sorethis is not the case for the kensington expert mouse or the logitech optical marble mouse where the button is faced up and you can click directly on it without securing the device in positionif you are young and not suffered from rsi this might not be an issue for you
but for the others that who are seeking an ergonomic pointing device this one is a no goive been using the logitech cordless trackman wheel  for  yrs and got used to using my thumb to roll the ball
this  optical trackman uses the nd and rd fingers to roll the ball
its an adjustment but i think ill get used to it
i do feel that the scroll wheel buttons should be closer to the trackball just like the rightclick button
i basically need to bend my wrist to get to the scroll wheel an inconvenience
draganddrop also need some getting used tomy logitech mx mouse is failing
the mx has served well and has caused me to become thoroughly addicted to its  button configuration
i need a new mouse with all those buttons but i use windows   logitech doesnt support that old os with its newest hardware
i had to try this trackball because its got the button configuration that i like and it supports windows   other logitech mouses yes  mouses is plural for computer mouse  mice is incorrect
have  buttons but dont support windows this trackman just isnt heavy enough to stay put when i hit the left mounted buttons with my thumb
i try to stabilize it with the remainder of my hand but its no use
i have to set speed and acceleration really high in order to cover all the screen real estate of a large widescreen with minimal trackball rotation so the slightest nudge of the ball while i try to hold the trackman steady while i click the left mounted button forces me to move the cursor ever so slightly and miss the shot
i have to constantly clean the trackmans mounting feet to keep it from sliding around because the slightest dust accumulation makes the feet slippery on my maple desktopi can control a mouse a lightening speed but this trackball is just too dangerous in my clumsy paw
if only it was heavier or if only it had some substantial rubber nonslip feet i think id have a chance
or maybe if it had a place for me to rest the heel of my hand i could then hold it in place
it just wont sit stilloh well  when windows  hits the market ill be upgrading and then maybe i can get an  button logitech mouse from their newest hardware lineupin the meantime i found the discontinued logitech mx from a korean seller at an auction site
it has a windows  driver
im waiting for it to arrive
its supposed to be new and in the product carton
where did they get it
i dont know and i dont care
it will at least give me a logitech fix until i can get the good logitech stuff after win is releasedi have been using trackball type mice for as long as i can remember
this one is ok its kinda weird using your finger to roll the ball but you can get used to it
i do like all the extra buttons they give you
i just wish they would add those buttons to a thumb controlled trackball mousefirst off let me say that this is the trackball to end all trackballs for the time
there is no other trackball out there that is as comfortable easy to use and well featured as this mouseif you still happen to be using xpyup here comes the badthis mouse was designed in xp days and forgotten about shortly after
setpoint updates for vista and win  have each taken about a year to appear and suffered horribly from compatibility issues
yes the reference driver from win  works but only in the most basic button form
the latest release of setpoint for win  has some major compatibilty issues with outlook  causing setpoint to crash
the scroll wheel no longer acts like a wheelbut now a button that when clicked activates autoscroll which goes absolutely crazy in internet exporer  pagesrandomly switching to auto scroll on its own and launching hyper links when even gotten close to
the only real solution i found to the auto scroll problem was to disable the scroll wheel gee thanks
support is poor to say the least i spent half a dozen emails back and forth to their forum trying to explain to a clueless tech that wheels roll not clickhe could not understand why i would want to roll down a page since the auto feature was so niftyeven with their short comings i have purchased  of these trackballs at  a pop over the last  years
i have yet to get a full year and a half use out of any before they start breaking down
first comes the button failure taking increasingly hard pressure to get the buttons to work then comes the loss of trackingthen death
yet i still keep buying thembecause like i said up top they are the best out there
but my rd is starting to die now and with the slew of compatibility issues im having with win and no help from supporti think i may just go back to a wired kensington tackball
little issues i can deal withbig issues plus reliability factor
ive had enough
if you do choose to buy this mouse please get the extended warranty
youll thank mesomeone suggested i try a trackball since i have carpel tunnel
i have a hard time controlling it even after several weeks of use
but the worst part is i dont really find it any less stressful on my wrist
maybe i was supposed to get a trackball with the ball on the side instead of the topthis product is not for someone who needs a product that just works out of the box because it does not
chances are it will take some tweaking to get it runningthe documentation is a mess and the troubleshooting tips on their web site are pretty cavalier about their compatibility problems and not very helpful
on the other hand if you can get past the installation hassles a print server is definitely a nice thing to havesome tips that should have been in the documentation go to  and download the firmware upgrade
the documentation explains how to install it
 if you have a parallel port printer and you cannot get it to print try switching the bidirectional feature from autodetect to disabled
my hp printer would not print anything until i did this
 if you are connecting to the usb port the printed documentation tells you to use the wrong name  lp only works for the parallel port
see the documentation on the web site which identifies the correct names for each of the three portsi read reviews of other usb cardbus adapters where lack of power from the laptop to the device plugged to the adapter was a problem
i can understand an ipod not getting enough power but my sandisk card reader
i have a two year old dell inspiron  with xp and sp
the single usb  plug built into the laptop started to become loose due to the dongle thats usually hanging off it wifi adapter is usually plugged to the dongle
no problem i think now i can upgrade to usb   i ordered this adapter from amazon based on the reviews
xp recognized the adapter right away and required no additional downloads
next i plugged my sandisk card reader in but only a faint yellow light on the card reader lit up
suspecting that the little ac adapter might helped i plugged it in
if this thing worked on my card reader without the power cord i would have given it five stars
to have to always be plugged in is a big handicap
this concludes my review of this adapter and begins my short rant on my old laptop
as i type this my laptop has three wires connected to it  the power cord cause my battery is week  my lan line cause my wifi adapter isnt built in and im having usb  issues and  my new usb adapter needs its own power cord
to add insult to injury my toddler ripped the r off my keyboard
i think this is a sign to get a new laptopafter i read some reviews from others i bought it by myself one
as soon as i put the card bus the windows recognize the new hardware and i dont even need to install the software
it works well in my computer with win xp but some times my computer just shut down itself once in awhile since i installed this card bus
please be careful before you bought this and make sure you read the review from othersnothing spectacular about this router but it works fine
it was fairly easy to set up but i had some problems with getting connected
i had to reset my modem a few times to get it set up correctly
i didnt have any problems with it shutting off or losing connectivity
this item was a good price but i am upgrading to a wireless router nowi ordered mine after some exhaustive internet research on all the other routers in the same price range on the market todaytwo weeks later mine allows me to share cable internet but not share files and printer between our two pcs
in fact there is nothing in the otherwise excellent documentation and setup help manual  cd rom that even touches upon this aspect of the router
therefore one is left with the unenviable task of trying to figure it out through windows bad help filesmethinks the reviewer who said he had this router up and running  minutes out of the box must be either  already a technogeek well versed in the black arts of pcland or  working for netgearlastly the included freedom internet security software is basically useless
youre much better off with nortons internet security or even zonealarmsadly though compared with other similarly priced routers the rpna actually shinesthis router gave me  years of troublefree service then it died
i only give it  stars because i am disappointed in its short service lifeit was difficult getting the device set up with the poor instructions and poor technical support
in desperation i called timewarner cable and asked their technical support  and they told me how to set up netgears product flawlessly better than netgear
and once it was set up the timewarner way it has worked flawlessly
even after powering up and down our network a few times over the months it has never forgotten how it was set up and continues to work very wellwhen i first hooked up this router i was unable to connect to the internet through it
running the wizard on the cd did not help
the router setup kept insisting that i have a static ip address when my isp specifically says i do not
the routers internet light remained amber indicating no ip address was obtained by the router
i carefully double checked and followed the instructions and powered everything up in the specified order
i power cycled several times no help
i checked netgears website and adjusted a setting recommended by the site this was no help
i emailed netgear tech support and they kept telling me to do the same things i already tried power down and power up the modemrouter adjust a setting
these things did not help
tech support kept telling me to do the same power downup cycle over and over even though each time i did this it was no helpfinally i discovered on my own what the problem was
although the instructions website and tech support very specifically say that the modem needs to be be powered up before the router is powered up with my ispmodem the opposite must be done
if i power up the router first wait till the check mark light goes off then power up the modem it connects to the internet with no problems
netgears instructions tech support and website all had it backwards at least for my ispmodem
so if youre having trouble connecting to the internet through this router try powering up in the reverse order router first then modem
after i discovered this everything else was simple and the router has worked greatthere are multiple versions fvsv v v
and then there are multiple v versions that are invisible to the eye
even with the latest firmwares as of march  it really makes no difference
one version of v can live up to the mbps wan line the other is stuck at mbps
when you buy this anywhere you are taking a  chanceif your wan outgoing internet line exceeds mbps dont waste your time
this pretty much includes all customers with comcast broadband and verizon fios
if you dont care about the wan speed stuck under mbps however then the switch is actually very stablei have had this for years the v it has run solid as a rock
setting up static ip routes for network storage and network printers is a breeze i used reserved ips for almost everything on my network and this handles everything you can throw at it
has been great for a small business the firewall is solid as wellnow to the reason i am shopping for its replacement
my internet connection used to top out at mbs and this could handle it fine however in our area we have now been able to upgrade to an mbs connection which this cannot handle
the thoroughput on this unit tops at just under mbs bypassing it and going straight to a cpu hits mbs
its a shame that this unit is just too slow to handle higher speeds as the world is headed that wayif you have fast connection or plan to get one you have to avoid this unit as it just cant keep up which is a shame because that is really its only drawback
if they come out with an updated version of this that can handle my connection id switch back but for now looks like i am headed for the dlink dgl as i am told by coworkers who have it that it handles the speed
if that one does or does not work with higher speeds i will put in a review of that one after i try itive had this router in my home for at least  years
its been rock solid  i dont think i have ever had to reboot it other than a power outage or some other reason
it was great until i upgraded to a faster internet service and this thing was topping out at mbps five
there is no where to configure this limit and its a ridiculous feature for a mb router to have
still i give it  stars because its been such a good device for what it was worth
if youre using it for a small business where you want to put a certain segment of computers on limited bandwidth  then its perfectnote please see new info at the end of this reviewi have been running several  fvs devices all versions on my internal network for many years now
i have found them to be stable and reliable and easy to configure
they also play well with other networking devices such as firewalls from other manufactures as in setting up and maintaining secure internal vpn channels between themvpn performance does falloff considerably with stricter encryption so internally across trusted subnets and through wireless channels i move unclassified data using desthe fvs also streams telemetry via syslog so its easy to keep track of everything
the device however does not have a secure local configuration option remote admin is supported via ssl thoughremote aggressive mode vpn works fine with this device with netgears vpn client software
the builtin vpn client in windows xp pro doesnt seem to want to play with the fvs
the remote identity type of fqdn or fqun required for remote access dont match up with the options available under xp pro
really it seems the fvs could have offered a remote identity type of ip address  allow ip any  but alas it doesnt perhaps to sell more client software
since i had the client software however i didnt pursue that option exhaustively
but off the cuff i dont see it as workableoverall the fvs is a good basic internal subnet firewall except in cases where syslog forwarding out the wan port is called for none of the fvs versions or  apparently supports this fundamental operation that i have seen anywayi would not recommend purchasing the device online from anywhere as it is impossible to tell which version    that you will end up with
the differences are significant and deal with the hardware as well as the firmware starsupdate note for information regarding the various versions of the fvs including identification please refer to the netgear web site netgear dot com finding the fvs in the product finder and then clicking on the support link which is in the same panel as the product finder
the product version information will be displayedversion is by serial number and this serial number is found on the unit itself as well as on the external side of the retail boxi am disapointed in the netgear ps in that it is not bidirectional
it will not report low ink cartridges paper out or other printer status functions
my printer is a canon i
otherwise it works great and was very easy to set upmy canon i has a usb port as well
i set up the computer beside the printer to use that port and it is bidirectional providing feedback on printer status
printer seems to work well using both the parallel and usbwhat is the point of having  ports when  computers overloads it
the one i received is not the stylish one either i received the older model which looks dullas others say the device is small and easy on the eyes
i express caution with regard to critical purposes such as servers and ip telephony we have experienced some weird problems with this
we have three netgear fs v in two locations two connected to a  port dell switch and the third i think connects to a cisco   they may intermittently refuse to forward frames from just one source to just one destination while allowing frames from that same source to other destination weird stuff like that
reset takes a power cycle or just unplug the uplink cable and reconnect
its a real nuisance if it means you have to drive to work on a weekend or an ip telephone call goes quotblipquot into lala land
im sure they have a limitation on the size of the mac address cache but i have not so far researched it
ltbgtbeware using little switches on big networksltbgt that sounds like a grade b movie titlethe linksys befsx is a faster and superior router to this netgear box
ive found linksys products in general to be more reliable than netgear
but ive be migrated to a new vpn client that utilizes ipsec ltp
although the linksys does support ipsec pass thru it does not allow ltp
this netgear router does
the print server is a nice plus if you want the router right next to the printer
i dont
so if you need ltp then this router is a good value
if you can spend more i would suggest the smc baricade  smcbrvpn
its better quality and supports ltp
but it lacks the print server and costs moremy first unit was defective
the second unit works well
this firewall works like a charm  has enough configs to make it a great solution
it turns out to be highly suspect to a little bit of extra electricity
make sure you have it on a top quality surge protectorps kudos to amazon
after getting an rma for the first unit from netgear amazon actually shipped me a new one before they got the defective unit back
all at no charge to me no shipping etc
thats why we love amazonthis device seems to be available sometimes but seeing as how it is very old  you are better off getting something more modern
check out the wrtgl if you need a new router
note that this unit offers b wireless with wep onlynetgear has some issues with this products reliability
the first one i had for about  months
one night it just died
all the lights were on and it wouldnt talk to any of the portscalling netgears support line was an adventure within itself
the call center is located in india
dont call this place if youre on a noisy phone or dont have lots of time to waste
the first person i reached could barely speak english
he was obviously reading from a script because when i explained that the router did not work i had followed the troubleshooting guides and this was the result etc etc he still started reading questions and asking me to connect it to a network and do silly tests
thats hard to do at work on your lunch break
he hung up very abruptly with the classic thank you for calling bye bye now
ltclick call  another person who could speak marginally better english
i went through his troubleshooting script connecting my router to an air network
he decided that it was indeed not working duh
and gave me an rma number
ok what exactly is a doofulfife
well its  double five
he did explain to me that the dash in the rma number is the little line on the keyboard you may find it beside your number  okaygot the rma i think
returned it and received a refurb unit and stuck it aside
in the meantime router  was in use
it died one day about  months after purchase
started forgetting ip addresses and not communicating with the printer
it got returned to the store it was purchased from and router  went into service
so far its worked for about  months
router  is waiting and will be the last onethis is really a good piece of technology it has just about everything youd need to set up and protect a home or small office network
it runs extremely hot which may be the reason it dies so quickly
now if only it was more reliable
 edit the last one of these i had finally died a painful death  it started adding nonexisting devices to whatever address it though was good at the time usually something that didnt relate to anything else on the network
since it had never worked well on wireless large file transfers caused lockup and it filled its meager routing table quickly i gave it a quick burial in the local recycle bin and bought something modernflash cards and other media storage types for that matter can sometimes fail
this is usually cause by user errori use this product with my digital camerawhen using a digital camera you may find that if you turn your camera off while it is writing memory to the card just after a photo being shot youll find that you may get fumbled results when trying to read the card latergranted this does not ruin the card rather it ruins the data on the card
formatting it resolves this issue but again you may not want this to happen when taking wedding pictures
you may find other parallel problems such asswitching modes on the camera just after taking a photoopening the flash card door when camera is onturning the camera off when its doing something with the card ie writing memory as stated abovelow battery might cause inconsistent results in datai might say though that when i did have my runin with one of these problems i contacted the company who manufacured the product and they were very helpful
they had me send them the card and they recovered all the images i originally lost
i ended up only loosing one of the photos the one which i was wrong to manage the camera incorrectlysomething i might say that gives this product  stars is that the data transfer rate is faster than any other means ive ever seen
data is dragged and dropped easily and effectively through a usb adapteri bought this to use with my microdrive but the reader is for type  i cf cards only
other than that it works just finei bought two of these cards for use in laptops that did not have a cf card slot
since my camera uses cf cards i figured this would work well as another way to backup my files
while it does work the speed is not so great with large files
backing up even half a gig of raw files from my camera can take about  times as long than using the camera itselfso i rarely use this anymore
its handy if i have to get just one or two photos off a card but for full backups i use sandisks usb cf reader
i cant speak for the multicard readers they make but the old cf reader is the way to go if youre looking for the best performancei bought this device to offload photos from a compactflash cf card to my laptop
the alternative is a usb device which would read different card types but would have to be carried separately
the sandisk compactflash pc card adapter does the job conveniently by fitting into the laptops pc strictly pcmcia slot and becoming a part of the computer always available for instant access
if you are sure that you will mostly only use cf cards this is a good way to go
other similar devices exist but most do not read both cf and other common card types
if your camera uses sd cards flexible options existi give this product only  stars because of  obvious flaws
the cf card cannot be ejected without ejecting the entire reader card
this is a design flaw but probably of minor inconvenience
secondly the transfer rate is slow which is odd for a device that fits into a pcmcia slot
i timed it at  seconds per approximately  mb raw file significantly slower than an external usb  card reader
this is not a big issue for transferring a few photos but for a full  gb or higher card you can do the mathi bought two of these cards to use on a week trip with my olympus c z digital cameraone of the cards worked beautifully
its incredibly convenient to be able to fit over  images on one cardthe other card worked for a few weeks then produced a disk error which meant it couldnt take any more pictures and that the  or so that were on it are not readable
very worryingi emailed sandisk and they replied that they cannot help and suggested that i get in touch with a file recovery company which will cost me almost 
i dont know if ill be able to get those  pictures back yetim disappointed because i think sandisk should help me more with recoving the files or at least have more resources to help me do it myself
my local camera retailer says that other manufacturers are far more helpful when these problems arise thoughts for people considering buying these cards  its worth it to pay a little more for a card from a company that will support its products  its better to buy   meg disks than   to reduce the chance of having an error like this happenthe sound is very tinny
i wasnt expecting a lot from these speakers and they provided thatif you are looking for something to listen to music on and enjoy it look for something else
if you just need to be able to hear an occasional thing these will sufficei have used some of cyber acoustics speakers in the past and thought the sound was greatthese guys sound like cheap speakers
they work fine for the job i use them for but i will not buy another pairthis speaker system is okay
it works fine with my desktop
i expected a  fuller sound but you get what you pay fori guess you get what you pay for
these work but not very well
i put them on my tv and they are not much louder than my tv speakers and not much better sounding
cyber acoustics makes some great speakers but these fail big timethe speakers that i received are different from the ones displayed
the speakers received were overall good speakers for what i needed them forto replace the old speakers for my computer that was no longer serviceable
however the seller should advertise the correct item
was this a bait and switchthese are only a little better than listening to the internal speakers on my imac
yes they can get loud but the sound quality isnt what im used to
its a good thing i got them fairly cheapthese are ok for light computer use but music or gaming not so goodone note bass and little mid range fidelityi wanted to use these for listening to rhapsody stream but ended up getting more expensive onesno great bargain here just  soundjust wish they still made those big cheap speakers that used to be found at computer showsthey sounded like  for only  bucksoh wellwhat can i say i was buzzed and honestly felt i needed to own these
dont drunk shop people it lands you with headphones that feel cheap have a sound that can only be described as distant and if you like bass dont bother with these
when i have a son and he starts listening to music i will give him these to use until then they will probably stay where i left them after trying them outworked great for a couple of months but the left bud broke and makes some weird noises with low sounds
the cord is not like a spring but plain which is somewhat annoying sometimes i use them to play guitari bought these speakers for my folks in india so that i wouldnt have to deal with vv conversion headaches
i assume anyone traveling abroad would like to buy these as well instead of a powered speaker
for someone who was looking for a barebones speaker this does the job well
the sound quality is acceptable though you can forget getting any bass out of the speakers
otherwise music played through sharp and clearpros dont take up too much space pretty good bass portablecons bad trebleoverall these speakers will work just fine for the computer but if for using special things with them you may want to consider because of the unclearness of treble due to the minimum buzz in the speakers
well you get what you pay fori kind of respect smc stuff given their price point  its inexpensive mostly reliable etc
it definitely does not provide the level of security of ciscos stuff though
the word quotstateful packet inspectionquot doesnt tell the whole story on how well a firewall really worksperforms
quotyou get what you pay forquot does kind of apply still to this day in the firewall arenaunlike others i have tried this transmitter actually worked and produced a reasonable signal on my car radio
i can now listen to stuff stored on my ipod
quality is not great and with only four station settings on a switch on the side   and mhz you are quite likely to run into interferance from real fm stations
and as others have said the quality of the signal is pretty marginalmore am than fm
but it does work and it doesnt cost a lot and its easy to use
thats a poweronoff toggle button on the front by the waythe irock
wireless music adapter gets  star each for its simplicity functionality and durability
it simply doesnt get simpler than this unit to use
it is quite literally plugnplay
the construction is durable enough to survive the gauntlet that is my glove compartment relatively unscathed for going on  months nowthe unit does have some serious shortcomings
if you dont have a very powerful receiver in your car youre almost guaranteed some static  dont expect cdquality sound
its like listening to a distant fm station
there is a marked difference between the sound quality in my  car and my  as the latter has a better antenna and receiverone of the features that makes the irock w so easy to use is also one of its most annoying quirks it only has one button  power onoff
the button engages itself far too easily
if you throw the irock w in a gym bag your glove box or even a pocket too quickly chances are the unit will turn itself on and burn through its two aaa batteries even while it sits unused
ive found the units led light unintentionally engaged too often thus its battery life seems to be relatively very short
if you can keep from engaging the power at inopportune times the irock w could provide you with a great deal more listening time than it provides methis unit could provide you what it provided me the quickest easiest way to get mp tunes in my car without spending a mint
if you can justify diminishedquality audio which admittedly can be tough andor dont want to break the bank the irock
w might be your ticket
just temper your expectationsthe fm band in southern california is crowded so this product cannot work well  there are stations already on the four selectable frequenciesin less crowded areas meaning number of stations not people it works great
just make sure you dont already have stations on the    or  fm frequenciesthe length is what you would expect from a  outlet surge protector but it is extremely wide
it is also lacking features that other surge protectors have such as an indicator light to ensure your equipment is actually being protected
one thing i do like are the sliding safety caps
my other surge protectors have them but i think those were slightly more expensivewhat can you say about this product
its a power strip
you plug stuff in and turn it on
it works
it gives you one plug thats a little separate from the others this is good if you have one brick
the plugs have sliding covers
everything i had fit nicely into the plugs
the main power switch is a little too easy to hit accidentally and shut everything off
one thing though
many description of this product including the one on the belkin site claim it has illuminated leds to let you know its on and surge
it does not have these
there are no lights on the product
so be aware
it comes in a blain brown box too not the belkin product box they showneat enough for three pronged plugs but all my charging cables are two pronged and i was unable to insert themthis is the smallest surge protector i could find on amazon
but it is still considerably larger than the older ones we have
the downside is that the surge protector can block access to the second part of your duplex outlet
try plugging in into the bottom part of the outlet to make room for an unprotected plugi had similar items purchased at an ace hardware store years ago
the one from ace could be used on a receptacle with face plate removed and the wall opening was totally covered
i have a bedroom receptacle where a surge protector is needed that is missing its face plate so i figured id buy this instead of a face plate
unfortunately this one is designed so that when plugged in it is not centered on the receptacle so the gap in the wall still shows
i dont get why its made this way but it is
it must be used in conjunction with a face plate otherwise the gap around the receptacle will be visiblethe outlets are too close together
with three prong plugs one needs more room
they should have placed them on the sides or left more room between them
in addition the surge protector does not cover the wall outlet completely
one must leave the cover in place and then install the unit
oh well it was cheap and it will work
jmcthe outlets i have been using this surge protector for dont have the part where the screw is supposed to be used for
therefore whenever i would attempt to plug it into an outlet the nub that is supposed to hold the surge protector in place would prevent me from plugging it in all the way
i had to get a sharp pair of scissors and cut the nub down to be able to plug the surge protector in securely
i still use it occasionally because i dont like the long power strips hanging from the wall but i am worried i am not using this surge protector safelythis surge protector is ok but it isnt clear from the description that it has a telephone line interface which is a waste of space
does anyone use landlines anymore
i would have preferred one without or with coax instead but it will dothe sockets are just too closepro sockets are very snug perfect to hold very wellhas good quality
con uses a single outlet as the mount and a plug for the ground for the second socketless stable prone to twistingoutlets too close leading to half the outlets being unusablei gave this tree stars because the product works as it is intended
my hope was that i could mount this on a wall away from the outlet but this screws into the outlet itself and does not come with a cord
should have read morenot
i was a little disappointed in the apparent quality of the product
seems to be a cheap import as opposed to a higher quality importnot to be prejudice in any way
it is a little too difficult to push device cord prongs into the sockets of the outlet
also i did not read carefully about the phone fax connections underneath
these dont have much utility and i would rather have gotten a few usb charger ports if i had noticed
the middle screw is quite long and meant to go through into the outlet itself to hold in place
considering how difficult to get plug things in it may be a protection when pulling out a plug so you do not accidentally unplug other precious devices which may be actively connected
i am not returning the unit for the price but i would be unlikely to purchase again
i had a completely different impression of belkin products assuming this is a genuine uniti wanted something with a surge protection in my bedroon wall just to feel safer about pluging  eletric devices in only one socket this item as described does the job affordable and good quality
i dont like the sockets being close to each other that it renders the others unusable especially when you use big plugsi have pairs of outlets in nearly every room in the house where  of them is connected to the light switch on the wall the other is straight power
an old surge protector i have has  sets of prongs on the back for the top and bottom outlets
so the top  go to the top outlet
the bottom  go to the bottom outlet
this still allows me to use the wall switch along with straight power but i get  outlets for each
unfortunately this unit is not setup that way
it only has  set of prongs for the top outlet and simply covers up the bottom one
meaning i am going to lose one of those outlet options by using this
it works fine otherwise but this setup really limits how i intended to use this devicei felt the build was a flimsy as well as the loose screw but if you wanted a  socket wall mount this one is pretty good i think
havent had any issues yetsetup is a bit strange as the item is constructed to screw into a socket but it doesnt fully cover the exposed part of the drywall
so instead you just plug it into your socket
the green lights are a bit much too
however it works and is protecting my electronicsi bought this item for two reasons to expand  outlets into  and to protect my hdtv and ps from surges
i am assuming its doing its job as far as surges go
been working fine since it was installed
however when i went to install it to the outlet i had a problemthis sp surge protector has a screw in the center that screws to the electrical box in the wall
after taking off the outlets faceplate i screwed the sp to the outlet in place of the face plate
when it was fully attached i had a gaping inch opening at the top of the sp that didnt fully cover up the entire outlet opening
the outlets face plate covered it up but this device extends more downward and leaves uncovered space towards the topi obviously had to screw the face plate back on
i also tried to screw the sp to the outlet with the face plate on
the screw wasnt long enough to grab the threads of the outlet
so as it sits now the sp is just pluggedin over the face plate but not screwed in
the screw is nice to have attached because it stops the entire sp from pulling out of the wall when you go to unplug somethingi bought this model because it was cheap had the amount of joule protection i needed and sits behind the entertainment center so i dont need it to be visually appealing
but if you want a better sp that fits the outlet nicely i would recommend the belkin surgeplus outlet wall mount surge protector with dual usb ports  amp   watt i own that one as well and it fully covers the outlet without the face plate and has  builtin usb ports to charge cell phones and keep them protected from surges
its a little more than this unit but worth it
make sure to go with the  amp  watt version if you plan on plugging smart phones in to the usb ports
if you get the  amp version it will take forever to chargehope you enjoyed reading my review of a sp please like my review because im trying to get into the amazon vine program where they send you items to reviewthanks and have a nice dayi was disappointed that this surge protector although rated  joules does not have a lower clamping voltage
it is good for standard use though
go for it if you are not trying to protect delecate computer equipmenti have purchased two of these units they are not as pictured or descibedi will still give this  stars because still a  outlet surge protector by belkin with comparable joules ratingwhy i take away  stars  when purchasedfor one star removed neither unit had a phone jack surge on the unit primary purchase for one of these unitsthe reason for removal of a second star one came packaged as a new item another was just thrown in the box with no package and appeared to be used to make it better it was  doa
i had to contact belking rather than amazon and belkin just sent me out a new replacement unit the following day and they advised me these models are the same with  diferences one major is the phone surge and the second a diferent color diode for indication of protection and groundbought this for a calculator that i bought and returned
it worked fine though
linked with my win  system with no problemson the positive side it basically does what i want it to dokeyboard i like the large delete key pointed out by another reviewer
also pointed out on the negative side and i agree the default should be use of the regular function keys not the special keys
i hope microsoft will add some software to make that possible but i see nothing in the current program that allows you to change that default
the microsoft instructions speak about the quotlightquot being on when the flock key which toggles between regular function and special key assignments is in a certain position
but there are no lights on the keyboard i receivednot for flock caps lock or anything else
so since i want the regular function keys i have to remember to change the flock each time
by the way even with the flock key set to use regular function keys there are still additional extra keys on top that can be used for their default valueseg mail webhome etcor changed to other commandsmouse one of my main reasons for buying this was to use my laptop for presentations and be able to hold the mouse some distance from the computer interacting with the audience
ive had mixed results
it will work at some distance sometimes
so there are times im fooling with the mouse to be sure its getting the signal which is not idealit is as good as many make out and is the first keyboard where i actually thought the extra keys were worth the extra software installbut be awarein a ghz radio dense environment  cordless phones wireless network etc this keyboard may have trouble finding a clear radio channel
there are only  and only  do not overlap each other a bit
so you are limited to around  items in range of each other
including your neighbors with their ghz radio devicesi have had problems with two keyboards ft apart causing one to type on the other computer
forcing a channel hop to a clear channel does not do it  kept fetching up back at the same channel as the other keyboardfinally and absolutely crucial  not recommended in a secure environment
someone with a receiver for the keyboard could be just the other side of the wall  tracking everything you typemaybe all ms keyboards have the strange layout with the double sized delete key and the insert key up higher but im still struggling to get used to it
i prefer the  key layout for the home page updn end delete insert between the letters and numeric keypad
i dont like the fact the function keys are off by default
the cordless works very nicely they keyboard has a nice feel
i just cant get used to the key layoutswhat i like microsoft naturalstyle ergonomic keyboard arrow keys have the standard layout compared to the diamond layout of the natural elite multimedia functions are a nice bonus wellbuilt like previous incarnations of microsofts natural keyboard linewhat i dont like only one windows key
 which makes it impossible to lock your workstation with a single onehanded keystroke windowsl unless you have gargantuan hands goofy layout of the home keypad inserthomedeleteendpguppgdown and a couple other keys makes it difficult to touchtype if youre used to the more standard key positionshaving used the original microsoft natural keyboard for a few years i figured i might as well upgrade to the multimedia one
i thought the extra quick access keys for email calculator buttons for multimedia players etc
would come in handy
in a way they are
they are programmable meaning you can decide what folderprogram is open for specific keys
but ive also found they dont necessarily respond when you need to use them thus adding a slight inconvenience
in fact after awhile i found myself using shortcut icons far more often than the programmable keysthis keyboard seems to feel a little cheaper than its predecessor
it doesnt feel as sturdy or as heavy as the original natural keyboard
sometimes when im typing i feel like whatevers holding the keys in place will suddenly break
in fact the legs that support the keyboard so the keyboard would be at an elevatedtilted position broke all too easily
its as if cheaper or thinner plastic was used for this particular model
i also miss having an extra insert key which has been replaced by an extra long delete key
another thing ive run into is the media key
i have that set to run winamp although sometimes ive found that it likes to run windows media player instead
not sure why that happensalso a big quirk as mentioned is the flock key
its set to be on by default meaning what normally would be the function keys are really the alternate uses
you can actually rectify that by downloading a small program it makes a minor modifcation to the registry file so the flock is off when you boot but remember if you need to do an f during a windows bootup be sure that the flock is onoverall its not a bad keyboard yet ive found typing on this slows me down a tad i was faster on the original natural keyboard
the natural multimedia keyboard needs to be better made and have a better driver so those programmable keys work all the time and not just at selective momentsdont use the software provided with this keyboard on your laptop i have found that it makes it so that all your fn keys do not workso preety much its just a regular keyboard since the hotkeys dont work without the softwarei bought this xd card back last june just over a year ago when i purchased my olympus d
the card has decent capacity at my preferred picturetaking resolution of x but unfortunately it developed some kind of glitch not long after i started using it and at least one or two photos per batch end up getting corrupted so that they cant be downloaded from the camera to my pc
this is not a major problem because it affects only one or two shots out of the whole cards capacity but i have found that for instance kodaks mb xd card is more reliable as well as being able to hold more shots
i still use this card but only as a backup to the kodak card and im looking at buying a gb card now that prices have dropped so much as im going to be attending a big convention next month and expect to take hundreds of pictures therejust to echo the other reviewer it does not work with pc  i emailed linksys and they replied and make it clear that all their wireless cf products do not support pc yet as of aug  
they are working on it but no time frame availablelinksys is really good though i emailed them saturday night and they replied sunday
i have some of their other products and they work flawlessly and their customer service has always been one of the best ive seen among tech companies
update aug  today i read from newsgroup that it works with a generic driver wlanforwincenetzip
amazon wont let me put urls on review so just search the web for this driver
too bad i had already returned the cf card and missed out the rebate period or ill try it out myselfi have had this camera now for about   years
it sits on the shelf
i have replaced it with a pentix optio  wr water resistantfirst off this camera takes beautiful pictures
crisp with correct color
the macro shots are wonderful too
there is a design flaw with the lens cap as mentioned below but it can be rectified with an aftermarket lens cap called an olycapbut the beautiful outdoor pictures are negated by the slowness in focusing and acquiring images indoors
indoor focusing is very hit or miss most often resulting in soft focused pictures
actions shots are impossible and by action i mean trying to catch your toddler doing something cute
you press the exposure button and sometime in the future the camera will shoot
my wife hates itif you want to shoot outdoor scenes and macros of flowers and bugs its a great camera
anything else you take your chanceshappy shootingi think i bought my olympus c back in  and i still use it from time to time
it may be only mp but takes pretty good shots
the presets work as expected too
the only drawback are that the memmory cards are obscture smart media and these cameras are hard to find for cheap
nobody wants to cut loose of these little guyscameras for kids fun and inexpensive projects for the little photographer volume animal portraits with the digital photography of john crippen learning photography with animalsscenic photography using examples from the california central coast a visual guide to the central coast and digital photographytrust memusicmatch can ruin ones ipod experience so many glitches i will not even try to list them
  dont get my review wrongi like my ipod and use it daily and probably would not buy any other model but  i think they need to change a few other things
  apple needs a separate pc website because pc support online is basically nonexistent  no audiblecom audible book service support for windowsbased users
additionally it looks like apple has an updated mac ipod updater  recently came out but not a corresponding new windows ipod updater and the website does not tell you that the update is not compatible with windows
pc ipods should have the same support and features as macuser ipods and it seems like there could be a divergence  sound check is a volume stabilizing feature on the ipod but it is not compatible with musicmatch s volume leveling and therefore effectively not compatible with windowsbased ipods
this is a great feature and it is wrong that it is not currently being supported in windows  cannot add composer tag used on the ipod through musicmatch and other music management programs  ipods internal software
i have suggested many of these changes to applea  long song artist and album names get cut off and some songs have the same name happens when you have s of songs which can lead to confusion
there is a screen i believe browsealbumsall songs where the songs are not in alphabetical order but in album order but the names of the corresponding albums are not on the screen
apple should add length time album artist name genre and track number of a song after the song title when the song title is highlighted for a certain amount of time
i think this could be accomplished by automatic scrolling over to the information when the song is highlighted and the longer the song is highlighted the more information is revealed
this could be especially helpful for songs with the same name which happens when you have lots of songs
further this could alleviate the problem with song titles being too long for the browse screen and this happens a lot with different remixes
also there are album titles that are too long for the screen too for example  masterpieces of classical music vol  vs  masterpieces of classical music vol  vs  vol  and so on and scrolling over to reveal the full title and artist would be excellent and if there is more than one artist for an album it could say various artists because right now if an album title is too long and the same with artist name there is no way to see the full title on the ipod even in the now playing screen it only scrolls to reveal the full song nameb add day of the week to the clockc songs that have no album title missing tag should be put under a miscellaneous or no album title when browsing artistsalbums
since these songs are not included in the album listings they will not play if you were to play from the album screen or when shuffling by albumsd apple should add scan or intro that plays the first  seconds or so of songs and you should be able to do this randomly and within artists composers genres albums and playlists until you hit a button and then it will play that song and will resume the scan after the song
this is extremely nice when you have thousands of songs on your ipod and dont want to sit there and hunt for the songe playlists
currently you have to download playlists not only song order but the actual songs so if you already have the songs in the playlist on your ipod you will have duplicate songs from your computer
therefore you should be able to create playlists on the fly from the files that are already on the ipod
more importantly and at least i would like to be able to create a queue list even just one queue list at a time would be fine so i can choose a song to play and then choose the next song to play and the next and so on and being able to save it as a playlist would be a great bonusf add wma file supportg the ipod places the group lo fidelity allstars in the f section rather than l like it does for the titles that begin with the and the same happens with titles that start with de
this should not happen in english menush  add support for second artists and song comments tags  firewire issues
as a pc user especially laptop users and pin firewire card users you may have to buy a new firewire card and an ac adapter if you want to supply power to the ipod while connected to your computer because many pc firewire cards do not supply power to the peripherals
there is not a separate power source on the ipod other than its firewire port which is can be connected to the firewire card or to the ac adapter but not both
downloading songs can be lengthy and battery intensive so the battery may only last for an hour or two while downloading via a nonpowered firewire card and so you will have to recharge before downloading to the ipod againi will try to point out some of the problems with this camera
it looks cheap and feels cheap plastic
cover of lens although good looking in pictures is very flimsy
try playing with one in a store and you will realize what i mean
its basically a very thin sheet held by a spring sure to break soon
too thickbig to compete with canon elphs
very less weight means more camera shake and blurry pictures
yes for a digital camera being too light is also problematic
picture quality only average for a mp
nothing spectacular
dont be guided by just a mp tag doesnt necesaarily mean better quality
just like having fastest processor on your pc doesnt mean best performance other things like motherboard chispet memory etc also count has max shutter of only  sec meaning you wont get any decent night or low light pictures
no video out port for watching pics on tv
no sound recorded with movies
movies have too low frame rate and useless quality
use as a webcam also isnt practical
lens worse than even other fuji  to make things worse it uses a propreitary xd card which is more than twice as expensive as cf card here on amazon
plus theres no mb in stock anywhere as of today
death to xd card why wouldnt someone buy a canon ass or fuji  or nikon  or minolta dimage x or one of dozens of kodaksonyhp models floating around 
why a with new propreitary card and no features for the price except a mp tag 
maybe you might like it thoughi dont see any reason why fuji couldnt use sd or mmc or cf or one of the existing formats or add video out and better movie mode
hopefully fujifilm will come with something better next time around all the favorable reviews about this camera are true
if only i could still turn it on
it would have been great to have for the rest of my lifei know exactly what the problem is
the batteries rest on metal tabs that do two things they are electrical contacts and they are supposed to act like little springs holding the batteries up firmly against the electrical contacts in the battery compartment door
unfortunately these little tabs are now sagging
so the batteries no longer make firm contact and even with fresh batteries the camera cant muster the power to take picturespulling the tabs back up is problematical
they are buried at the bottom of the battery compartment and very hard to get atthe camera still works fine if run off its power adapter
you have to be near a power outlet
this basically turns it into an indoorsonly cameradidnt the fuji engineers know that a thin strip of metal placed under constant pressure will eventually sag
maybe they were well aware of this
maybe this is an example of planned obsolescencemay   update  i flexed the metal tabs upward with a nut pick and the camera is working normally againtip when storing the camera remove the batteries
this will take the stress off the connections at the bottom of the battery compartmentreceived binocularscamera as a christmas gift
the binoculars seem to work fine
however the digital camera leaves a lot to be desired
do not expect to get a sharpe picture on distant objects
i have taken at least  different shots and the only fair ones are from  to  feet
i am using the nikon colpix mega pixils
the difference is like night and day
do not expect the meade camera to even come close to the quality of our nikon 
we  plan to use the binocular portion mainly on hiking trips and to take an occasional picture at about  feet out
this would be ok for someone new to digital photography and wants a entry level camera
a nice toy but not a quality cameraspywaregator is evillogitech is evil for allowing gator or in this case its alias wild tangent to sneak into our computers via their softwarewhen you install the software that you need in order to use all your nice fancy keyboard shortcuts youre unwittingly installing hidden and definite spyware from gator
this is absolutely ridiculous and we as consumers should not tolerate this type of shady behavior from companies like logitech
this is absolutely inexcusable because  logitech does not tell you you are installing spyware  logitech does not give you the option to install their software without the spyware  logitech does not give you the option to remove the spywaredo not promote this kind of offensive business behavior
tell logitech that you dont support their utter lack of business ethics by not buying their productsps  the default off setting for the flock is also stupid
maybe logitech intends to fix this issue with a software patch that surprise comes piggybacked with more spywareno im not talking about honey on the keyboard
i love this keyboard its just that im extremely disappointed
i love the media player controls the little scroll wheel on the left and the quiet keys
with great love however comes great disappointment
the windows start key has started getting stuck in the down position sometimes leading to some strange behavior when im typing
the sad thing is that the keyboard is only  or  months old
i guess i could return it or something but its such a pain
and what would i do without a keyboard for the eternity it takes to get it backluckily so far i havent accidentally erased anything because of the sticking but every once in a while ill suddenly switch to the desktop windowsd or accidentally activate the windows narrator whatever the crap that isother than this annoying quirk this is a great keyboard
but because of this annoying quirk i cant really recommend this keyborad
maybe i got a bum one but this doesnt inspire confidence in the product for mepros excellent image quality and color fidelity x optical zoom twochannel audio control megapixel still image capture lightweightcons too many controls per button onboard microphone is omnidirectional mediocre battery life with included cellsummary an ok camera just not what i expected
i own a sony vx and pd we use in video production of homes for sale
we bought the gl because of the fact it was about a half pound lighter and a little smaller than the sony cameras
the first problem is when you attache the small  watt canon light the drain on the battery is too great and shuts down the camer before the battery is one half way drained
even with the biggest battery that canon makes the battery life is short with their fill light
the second problem was when the telephoto zoom button failed after  minutes of use making the auto zoom function useless
now i must send the camera back to canon only after  days of use
the mail order place would only take it back within  days
the third problem is the low light noise is a little worse on the camera when compared to the sony vx or sony pd
it is not a big difference but it is noticeable
i never had a reason to mail in a sony camera for repairs even after years of use
its a dissapointment to have a new camera fail in so many waysi have an old powered rca antenna from the mid s and it picks up almost all the hdtv signals in my san jose ca area quite consistently
but i thought maybe this zenith silver sensor antenna with is many many positive reviews would be betterat least slightly
well it was not better
its performance was about equivalent to my old rca
i didnt pick up any more channels and it seemed to be highly directional whereas my old rca was not directional at all
so i returned zenith
too bad
it goes to show that there are probably other fine hdtv antennas out there whether the antenna was designed supposedly for hdtv or notthis antenna does work better than several others i tried but it still does not consistently pick up the hd signals
i live about  miles downhill from the towers and channels come in sometimes sometimes they dont
im actually a little surprised it got such rave reviewsi heard a lot of great things about this antenna but my results werent the best
im trying to get hdtv signals
most of my signals are in the high s and s as far as the rf frequency goes
this antennas did great with those signals
however there were two lower frequency hdtv signals one at  and another around  this antenna had poor performance for both of those
the one at  is somewhat understandable since thats at the lower band of uhf but supposedly the performance is even across uhfwhats worse is that i had cheap radio shack antenna that i tested and it did better
this was a simple rabbit ears antenna with a uhf loop and no amplification
i got about  stronger signals on the  and  channels and the rest were just as good
so the performance of this antenna wasnt abysmal or anything just not as good as a cheap uhf loopi was expecting big things from this antenna from the reviews
it didnt even outperform the  antenna i bought from target  and that one has vhf and is less directionalthis is not worthless its just not significantly better than other indoor antennas and its uhf onlyif you live within  miles of the transmitter this little antenna will work well  it is a uhf only antenna for channels 
beyond about  miles youll probably want to consider an outdoor antenna pointed towards the hdtv transmitter especially if you are in a stucco building on the ground floor without windows facing towards the transmitter which is my case
my usb hdtv box found  stations using this antenna both home shopping channel  with my rooftop antenna it found  hdtv stations some that i didnt even know about
im  miles from san francisco where the transmitters are located
if i were in san francisco i could probably get by with this indoorsits also cheaply made but a good design which is why it worksi was hoping this antenna to get better reception than the terk but it did not
i live in south florida maybe somewhere else is better but not in the west palm beach areawell ten minutes after i install this antenna i accidentally broke the connector without even knowing it
so it only worked temporarily for the first few minutes and it did bring in vey good signals from receivable stations
actually this is the first time that i noticed any significant difference with and without a antenna comparing to a copper wire connected to a tv
however the assembly is extremely fragile
during the adjustment i accidentally pulled the base plastic piece out and broke the wire connection to the coaxial cable connector
knowing that it actually works i rushed to a home deopt store and bought a solder gun to fix it
now it is working fine
but just be careful when handling it
not a high quality product but it works way better than my other amplified antennai get better results from old amplified rca antennaantenna does not work as well in a house with a stucco finish
it cannot be placed near exterior wallsthis is a highly directional antenna
that means you have to point it right at the transmitting station or you wont get a signalthis antenna may work for you if you live in a place where all the tv transmitters are in the same place
it is not practicle in a place like the bay area where the transmitters are in several different locations
in order to change to different channels the antenna must be movedgetting a good signal in a house with a stucco exterior is especially difficult
on a stucco house the exterior walls are surrounded by a tight wire mesh which acts like a huge farraday cage
this messes with tv signalsin a stucco house to get a signal with this antenna it must be placed away from the exterior walls
it works best in the center of the room or next to sliding glass doors away from the walls
in our bedroom it worked best sitting right on the bed
it could not be placed on any dressers or night stands because they were too close to the wallsthe other place where this antenna will work in a stucco house is in the attic
the antenna comes with a  foot coax cable
i put on a  foot cable and it did not seem to impact the quality of the signalthis antenna is very light and easy to tip over
it comes with a skinny lightweight coaxial cable to hook up to the tv
it is mostly stable when using that light cable but can still tip over if you dont set it right
when i hooked up a longer cable which had the standard diameter the unit could not support the weight and tipped over
to keep it in place i had to put something heavy on the basei got better results with an old amplified uhf antenna
it is made by rca and is just the basic loop
once i found the optimum position it got all the channels but one
and i dont have to move it when i change channels
also i can place it near a wall without any problemsi had high hopes for this antenna but received only modest improvement
our goal was to simply get better uhf reception since the abc affiliate in our region moved to uhf a few years ago and we have philosophical differences with our local cable provider i happen to value customer service and they dontin any case the quality of reception was improved marginally but there was some improvement
one very important piece of information to remember however if you purchase this antenna be sure to purchase a twoway two into one combiner adaptor
you can find one at your local hardware store emphasize local as the big box boys dont like to bother with these for only five or six bucks
do not get a signal splitter that is designed to take a single signal and split it to two separate receivers
you want something that will combine two signals into one
you dont want a little slide bar cablevhf antenna joiner and you dont want a vhfsatellite combiner
be sure that you get something that combines vhf and uhf into a single cablegood luck this was worth the price to us but only because it was less than thirty dollarsthe antenna itself is really good
i can receive  digital channels
then last day i dropped it on the floor and it stopped to work
after checking i found one wire was falling off the soldering point had to solder it backthis may be a very good antenna but i cant tell because i only get one channel of reception
in reading up a little bit online i may be too far away from a broadcast station
something to consider when you are away from metropolitan areai bought the phdtv same thing i believe and could not get  local hd channels
i found out they were vhf nbc and cbs in cleveland ohio
this antenna couldnt pickup these hd channels  its a uhf antenna only
be careful and do your homework
i had to return this and get the terk hdtvi which works great for me
the terk is uhf and vhf capablegood luckturbo tonyif you read the reviews some people pan this and say it wont even get what rabbit ears get
they are correct
others rave about how well it brings in signals compared to even expensive antennas
they are correct toowhat you need to keep in mind is that some hdtv signals are on uhf and others are on vhf
the manufacturer calls this an hdtvuhf antenna not an hdtvuhf as amazon had it listed when many of the reviews including this one were originally writtenrabbit ears work on vhf and not uhf so its not surprising that they get some channels better than this  its not designed for vhf
on the other hand this antenna does a great job on uhf so hdtv signals there will come in clearlybefore you get it check to see where your stations really are on the spectrum
keep in mind that they may move once analog goes away and that they may have an alias
ie
what appears to be channel  might really be  even though your tv says  and they may plan to move back to channel  in the future when the analog channel  is gone
keep in mind that most hdtv channels are on uhf so in some parts of the country this will work perfectly
but if you get some channels great and others not at all you might be missing those stations that are really on channel  or belowother similarly designed antennas will have the same problem so go by what the manufacturer says not necessarily what the listing saysi give it  stars in terms of being an hdtv antenna and  stars as a uhf only hdtv antennaa hardware firewall is very useful when you have an alwayson internet connection because a blocks many categories of incoming attacks from even seeing your computeri had the befsx for several years and it worked great so when i needed one for a new network connection i ordered the newer model befsx v   after connecting it my internet connection became highly erratic  some sites did not load at all email downloaded very slowly etc
a firmware upgrade to the  firmware fixed this problem and now it is working well again
the firmware upgrade is available from the linksys web site but it is disappointing that it worked so poorly out of the boxalso the firmware upgrade process is flawed
when you try to upgrade via the browser interface it seems to work if you check the version using the browser interface you still have the old version
to really upgrade you have to use the upgrade utility that is available on the same support page of the linksys web siteyet another pitfall to watch for is the product version
there is a v and a v of this device and if you use the v firmware with a v box as i did you end up with a paperweight  months into using our new linksys befsx router i went to connect to the internet and the router was dead this was last nightim using an  year old hp gateway router right now
i have included what lead to my reason why i only give the router  stars to save others from wasting their time with product supportwith  years of working with computer software and hardware it didnt take me long to surmise that the power adapter was no longer functioningit wasnt warm despite being plugged into a functioning surge suppressor overnight
i doubted it was the router that was the problem
my husband further tested the power adapter with a power meter and the adapter was indeed dead we also checked another adapter that we knew was working to verify the power meter was functioning properly it wasi checked the linksys web site to see about a warranty issue since it was past the  day amazon warranty
i found that there was an option to replace a defective power adapter with no need to return the defective unit that was a clue that there is obviously an issue with the power adapters if they have their own rma option
i figured cool this should be easyfamous last words
i now needed to get an rma to have a new adapter sentunfortunately this meant calling the linksyscisco outsourced to god knows where tech support i have a better namewaste of time nosupporti ended up having to call three times because the first person didnt give me an rma before hanging up although he did agree with me that it was most likely the power adapter
my second call i was put on hold for just shy of  minutes with dead air before i finally hung up
my third and final call stuck me with an unbelievable airhead
after starting to ask me questions about an ethernet card nic which had nothing to do with the router she proceeded to ask me the same questions over and over even though i had already answered her when did you buy the router
march th where did you buy the routeramazoncom
how many lights are on the front of the router
none theres no power getting to itso the power light isnt even onno
this went for three rounds
even though i explained that there was no power getting to the router because the power adapter was not emitting power she proceeded to have me reset the router using the reset button
hello
theres no power getting to the router so resetting it wont do any good
i went ahead and held the stinking button in for  seconds
now she says how many lights are on the front of the routernone
theres no power getting to the router
and do you know what her response was
okay your router is defective
you will need to return iti held my tongue
i didnt say what i really wanted to say to this poor excuse for tech supporti got the rma i needed checked the box for replace defective power supply option on the linksys rma web site page and proceeded with my request to have a new power adapter sentso the moral of my storyif you can help it avoid the linksyscisco tech support because in my opinion its a complete waste of time and another fine example of useless foreign outsourcingcorporate america bring the jobs back to the us for petes sakei have no problems whatsoever with the router performing and protecting for standard home use in fact id recommend it strongly for this use alonewhere i have a problem is connecting into my companys vpn
tried turning off spi it connected but couldnt broswe the ms network drives
put the laptop on the dmz wspi off still the same issue
moved the laptop to the dsl connection before the router works fine router isnt involved at this point
i also tried the laptop on other routers and it was fine with connecting in
by process of elimination it has to be a problem with the linksys unfortunatelyi still recommend this product just beware if youre using it for connecting to a vpnthis is not related to the vpn functionality of the router itself just its passthrough ability for ipsecpptpthe linksys befsx is a fine router but its maximum throughput measures only  mbps and with the spi engaged it drops to  mbps which is just too slow for a modern high speed broadband connection
maxxi purchased these olympus binoculars at the same time a set of canon x image stabilization binoculars
i wanted two for a trip in may for my wife and myself
after using the higher priced canons with image stabilization and large field of view everything else does not seem that good
with the small eye pieces i find it hard with the olympus  to align my eyes with the eye pieces and therefore see out of both eyes well
also keep in mind that when you do use the large zoom option you are loosing a lot of light which is ok during the day
this is of course not a good feature in the evenings or nighti know a lot of these shortfalls all come from being small travel binoculars which is why i gave it a  star rating instead of a lower rating
image quality is good for the size and the zoom is a nice feature but the image will be hard to keep in the field of view on the largest setting
if you do have the money then these work well for the size
if you can afford to spend more and give some on weight and size then i really recommend the canon image stabilization binocularsim sure it doesnt cost much to manufacture this cleaning tape
its way over price
but im using it with a  canon camcorder so i am willing to pay for the canon recommended head cleaning tape
okay i will stop whinning nowi bought this memory card to use it with my digital camera but then i bought a memory card reader and ive been using it to store music and videos toothe memory has been very fast and reliable and i have never taken as many pictures to full mb
but for the media sometimes i found mb to be insufficient
sometimes i think a mb card would have been better for my needstheres a similar sdmmc model which is packed with a portable reader key chain and you should take a look at it because it seems very temptingif your friends are always complaining about your phone being busy because of your kids tying up the line with the internet of course you never do this  this just might be the solution for you
this device only works if you have the call waiting option from your phone company
what catchacall does while you are online er i mean while your kids are online is that it monitors for the call waiting signal
when it senses the beep it automatically alerts you that a call is coming in by beeping
you now have the option to pick up the phone and answer or ignor it and continue surfing
the setup is pretty easy
you plug a phone into the back of the unit and to a phone line that is coming from the phone jack in your houseroom
then a line is connected to the back of your computer
lastly you will have to find a power outlet in which to power the unit
the rub is that you need to have an extra phone line that is near your computer
if not you will have to get a long extention cord and a phone jack device that allows another line to come out from the jack
this is what i had to do
i ran a long phone extention cord from the hallway into my home officehow well does it work
catchacall claims that you can take a call and then go back to your internet surfing after you hang up
this is sort of true
it definitely does a good job of catching those calls
when ever the catch a call beeped i just pick up the phone and talk to whoever was on there
on some rare occasions when i picked up the call i would only here the modem static of my computer instead of the caller
im not sure why this happens but it occured about  out of every  times
as far as returning to the internet after the call in theory when you hang up you can go back to surfing
this can be done if you are not on the phone for more than  to  seconds
after that when you go back to your surfing your modem will have disconnected
all you have to do is to hit refresh and your connection will be reestablished
be aware that you can only take calls from the phone that is directly connected to the catchacall and not from any other phones in the house
catchacall can prevent you from losing all those phone calls while you are online
however some of the trouble if at all in using it will depend on how your houseapartment is setup for phone lines and the price that you pay for the unit
if you buy it for retail you have probably not gotten yourself a very good deal
try shopping around as this unit is also sold at some of the electronic mega stores at much better prices than radio shacki was looking for a good quot tv and of course everyone mentions the sonynot a sony fan i see them resting on their name more than anything these days but i figured id give it a shothooked it up  component dvd svideo gaming antenna all of it
first things first clarity is really good
i went from a blurry as heck  to a pretty crisp   nice
games looked outstanding
dvds looked well wrongi bought the tv because it had  mode
great i love anamorphic dvds
turned the option on in my dvd player turned  on with the tv hmm it doesnt look right for some reason
i checked online and it is a known issue that the sonys oversqueeze the picture
and were not talking a mm or so were talking over an inch
so a  movie was more like a  or   something that was grossly distorted
soo i had to break into the service menu grab some measuring tape and used a setup disc to make a circle well circular
something sony obviously couldnt do
flaw one but fixablei tried watching the simpsons on this tv  not a good idea
homer is yellow not orange
people dont all have sunburns on tv
i tried fixing the colour and it got to the point where to make skin tones look even tolerable everything else had a noticeable drop in saturation
checked online surprise surprise red push for sony tvs
only on the newer fss theyve changed the registers in the service menu so good luck finding out exactly what to change because its not what it used to be
flaw  not quite fixablethen there was the geometry
images shouldnt bend out near the top few inches
also when i was playing games there was major distortion in games that had letterboxed cutscenes  to the point where it looked like the few inches between the blackness of the letterbox and the bright scene resembed a scrambled cable station
not good
flaw  i didnt even want to try to fix ittook the thing back
from what ive read its definitely common enough that i didnt want to bother with another sony
maybe im picky but for  bucks i deserve to beinitially this keyboard made me pretty happy
i was using a notebook computer and just didnt feel comfortable using its embedded keyboard cramped and gets hot when computer works hard
thats why this logitech keyboard was purchasedlogitechs keyboard generally works nicely but i since moved away from using it
yes im back to the notebook keyboard
heres why  in my opinion of course the navigator keyboard has two design flawsspongy keys
well im not sure exactly how to describe that but the keys are either depressed with deep motions or they just are too spongy
i type slower on this keeboard than ever before
function keys are disabled by default
the same buttons function as shortcuts to windows programs first
you must switch on the keys with some other button after every boot
that is just not natural for me
if you dont use function keys  then this style may be right for youthis is a workable little device but i wish logitech had put in better optics
it has very crude optics but theres a manual focusing ring
i couldnt find mention of that feature anywhere so youve learned something here alreadyit needs a lot of light to provide a clear image so if youre trying to use it for work you need to either have a big bright window or setup special lighting arrangementsthe problem though is the supporting infrastructure
logitech partners with a vendor who provides web cam support but this partner focuses adult recreation and unsurprisingly isnt the most honorable of vendors
every visitor to your site is invited to install some oddball spyware program and you can be sure many will
thats not going to make friends
so the supporting web site is unusablei tried corporate video conferencing using atts webex to see if i could do inexpensive desktop vc across firewalls
the image you see is very small resolution is limited in this mode to x and the picture is smaller than x pixels  i dont understand that one yet
unsurprisingly when you think about it a bit webex couldnt keep up at all
so forget use across firewalls without some custom firewall configurationi tested pointtopoint video across a corporate wan using yahoo messenger no firewalls
that worked better and might be feasible if theres no firewall
image is only x the software supports x only for video capture not for video conferencingconquercam is a  shareware package that does work well with this device
for sharing a whiteboard i use conquercam to acquire one image a second and ftptransfer the image to an accessible server
this would work much better if the optics in this thing were improved the optics are not the equal of the effective resolution native lens resolution plus any ondevice lossy compression
to get even barely useable results the device must be perpendicular to the viewed surface this is hard in the absence of a tripod mountin summary poor optics light sensor adequate poor bundled software
id happily pay twice as much if they would use usb  or firewire to get adequate throughput  usb  is barely up to transferring  xga images a second better optics and include a tripod mountoverall the quickcam is okay
it doesnt have great resolution
its not my computer dell ghz mb memory  and  gig hd and upgraded video card it isnt able to put the video to fit the size of the screen
also the software is very intrusive
it tries to set the quickcam as the default for everything
would i buy again
not for the  er so dollars i paid
i thought it would come with some cool software like my other ligitch cam came with like the ability to do stopmotion productions and the ability to have it monitor a room with motion activation
feel free to email me with any specific questionsthe first thing i want to say is that the difference in quality you get out of this cam is very evident depending on what im program you use
i used yahoo for a while with family and we were all about ready to toss the thing in the garbage
however since logitech recommends msn messenger we thought wed give it a shot
huge difference
the images were more clear the sound was better and there were fewer freezeshowever it was still hardly outstanding and you must be prepared to spend quite a bit of time with your family and friends tweaking the distance of the cam from their face the sound levels the volume on their speakers etc
and if they change any of that the next time you videoconference youll need to start over
this thing is not plug and play for most peopleface tracking is utterly useless
i dont know what miracle people are using to get it to work but for me all it does is make the cam jump all over the place
if youre impossibly frustrated with it try switching to msn messenger go through the sound setup see if that does the trick if not then move the cam closer to your face and then turn down the volume on your speakersconstruction is very cheap logitech should include super glue to mount the camera on the base
dont try to adjust the rubber focus ring unless youre just out of the shower it requires bonedry fingers to grip and not slip
tech support is pretty bad return it is all they say and then i suppose id get back a refurbed one
spotlife isnt too expensive but its a shame if the other reviewer is correct in saying that it was not required to webcast from previous quickcams
the followthehead feature is neat and the included software is functional if not pretty good
in conclusion  although i never had the  id bet the  is logitechs recession version  rather than raising the price when the economy wont support it spend less in manufacture and support and make the enduser cough up more cash in the long run
face it folks  its where microsoft and intuit are goingi hope dell doesnt adopt the model theyre the last refuge of pay a little once and enjoyi purchased this product and so far am happy with it
i do however believe that logitech as a company is deceptive in its rebate allowance
i typically review rebate information very closely as i know that rebates include as many restrictions as possible to avoid to company paying them out
i read the amazon rebate description carefully a couple of times and felt i could get the rebate upon purchase
when i went to logitech to fill out the rebate there was additional information restrictions that said you had to purchase both a desktop and a notebook webcam and that both had to be on the same receipt
i found this to be not only deceptive but also a little ridiculous as i wonder how many people would actually buy both a desktop and a notebook webcamthe best advice i can give you is assume that you will pay the price without the rebate and count yourself lucky if a rebate is ever providedthis is my first time buying a web camand i have to say is its a great product
one feature i like is the feature where it track your face
you dont have to play around with the software to pinpoint the faceone big bad factor about the logitechthe software
when u try to install the program it will install an adware call backwebits a no no
the backweb program can install and upload information from your computer with out your notice
plus you can get a trojan without noticing it
luckly i had pestpatrol to clean it out
if it wasnt the software problemi would have given it a  starsfor close ups this camera is fine but forget the zoom
very out of focus even after turning the focus ring six ways from sunday
it just doesnt get sharp
maybe  feet is the maximum distance
outside of that its too blurry
i also have the  webcam nx and it has a much better picture for distance shotsthe focus ring took some work to get it free
the rubber ring seems to get stuck on the plastic camera body
i managed to get some plastic under it and finally got it to turn although it still isnt very easythe face tracking consists of zooming in and out to find the person
there isnt any movement of the camera body
for that you have to go up to the next level of logitec camerascolor is very good and there are plenty of automatic and manual settings for light background color etctwo bases are included one for hanging onto the laptop and the other for flat surfaces
both have rubber bases to keep them from slipping
the laptop one is very durable and flexible so you can bend it to fit the edge of the screen or other vertical flat surface
they just snap on so its very easy to change from one to the otherif only it were sharper it would be a really nice camerathere is nothing too amazing about this webcam standard features with reasonable frame rate
ive bounced it around since having it and it still works finei bought this combo knowing that the mouse might not be good and it was worse than i thought it was going to be
the mouse lags and skips and was made it very painful to simply navigate the desktop
the keyboard however is pretty good and was the reason i bought the combo
i purchased the combo on sale  because i really wanted a cordless keyboard but unless you like laggy mice dont plan on being able to use the mouse that comes with it
my only complaints with the keyboard are the software and the playpause button on the keyboard
the software is very primitive compared to the microsoft keyboard software and does not allow you to map any key to whatever you want
some keys can not be remapped and the ones that can have a limited list of options
furthermore the go button and web  buttons do not work with non microsoft browsers
my other issue with the keyboard is the playpause button
it is way to sensitive to the point where when trying to paused a track it will double click unless you tap it very very lightly and start the song over
dont buy this combo unless it is at a price that you are willing to pay for just the keyboardthe cordless portion of this product set works fine most of the time although there has been a couple times i had to resynch itthe keyboard is rather clicky and annoying if you have to listen to someone else typing on it
it feels okay if you are typing on it yourselfi dont use the mouse anymore
i use a logitech wireless trackball which i love
a nice thing is that i could the their trackball with the keyboardmouse receiver without adding a second receiverthe added control buttons are nice
i like the volume control wheel better than  buttons for volumei thought id like the left hand wheel but in reality i almost never use itoverall its fine but im not thrilled with it
i probably wouldnt buy it again but dont mind having it aroundi love the keyboard a lot but the mouse has some to be desired
i often have stints of where i use my computer for gaming or for other things as many as  hours in a day
the batteries for this mouse last on average two weeks when used on my primary machine but the batteries in the keyboard actually outlasted the hardware itself
it quit working after a year  week after it fell out of warrantyi ended up just getting another kb and mouse new and moved it to my nd computer which i only use about    mins a day
its been like this for about  months and i have yet to replace any batteries in either mouse or keyboard
i like the shape of the logitech keyboards so i ended up buying the corded version with the cordless mx mouse for my primary computer everything i didnt like about the cordless elite mouse is fixed on the mx plus it functions with the accuracy and refresh rate of a corded mousei recommend that if you buy these you do not fall under any of the following catergories use your computer more than  hours a day
any heavy gaming or any games that require a fast and accurate mouse
intensive photo editing or any application which requires a high dpi rate if you know what dpi is you probably should opt for the mx mouse insteadi was looking for a doublesided mouse to replace the one that came with my imac
this one was priced right and has worked out well for me
it doesnt scroll very smoothly which might be an annoyance to some but it works well for normal everyday word processing and internet uses
it is comfortable as wellnice looking mouse wheel moves well slim design but i couldnt get the software to work properly on my g  running osx  system refused to recognize the mouse so i couldnt set any of the preferences
emailed macally support and they sent me what they called the correct and most up to date driver but same problem
had to return the mouse to amazon for a refund
replaced with a logitech mx laser
just installed the software it works
im just trying it out and will post a review soon
ive justed several logitech mice and have never been disappointedmy router did not work with my wink and xp computers out of the box
my connectivity to the internet was good ping and traceroute but web and email was very very slow and often timed out
finally i downloaded and installed the latest firmware from smc and it solved the problemthe signal strength is very good  stronger than the cisco aironet that the smc replaced
i dont have dead spots in the house like i used tothe configuration gui is simple and easy to use
although i havent tested any of the firewallsecurity functions yetoverall i am satisfied with this router but i only rate it a  because it shouldnt have shipped with the old firmware
i would recommend downloading the latest firmware and installing it before engaging in any troubleshootingsetup was straightforward and it appears to work perfectly fine
i did notice that my wifi card was unable to get a signal when i got home the other day
i reset the router and it was then able to get a signal
not sure exactly whats up but resetting the router resets everything password settings etclike most others who wrote reviews i was attracted to the price of this unit and the ability to have a router and wireless access point in one unit
i should also mention i chose this router because it explicitly supports macintosh computers including appletalk and its setup is webbasedironically the setup with my powerbook using airport was painless and ive not had a single problem with it
i love the webbased administration and the range of functions you have mac control wep spi firewall etc
the biggest hassles i have had with this router revolve around its dhcp server and getting it to communicate with my wifes sony vaio with a dlink dwl card
so far ive had no luck even using static ipive not needed to reset this box like some others
your mileage may varytech support is based in india
very polite but they follow a script pretty rigorously and i havent been referred to a higher level technician despite repeated callsbottom line  an ok unit
i suspect there are better ones out there but for now it fits the billi had some issues with the first couple of inverters trip lite stood by their equipment
i have had the replacement for about a year now and i am very happy with the performance
i use it in a marine environment and it has run my electronics computer system  tools while maintaining my  the batteries battery banks perfectlyit works like they say it supposed toit is a bit loud with the hummafter a month of use my inverter starts to lurch with the power and kicks the normal power off for just a second
not sure what is happening but it is an inconveniencewhen on battery power things work greatthe humming is always theredoes what it says gives you basic record playing ability with no adjustments possible except for  or  inch disk and   or  rpm
has a fancy rubberband for a drive beltadequate for the price dont expect anything fancy tho
selling points are that its cheap and has a line out capability
drawbacks no tonearm adjustments no suspension no antiskatebiasspeedetc adjustmentsaudio technica  atpl belt drive turntablei purchaed the pl
first the product discription is misleading
this turntable works but it will not last
the only saving thing is that it has a built in pre amp which i did not need
you would do better to spend a few more dollars a buy a direct drive turntablewhat can you say about a telephone line cord
its long
its black
its durable
it works
no better and no worse than what ive used beforethe amazon review is correct in stating that a converter box will allow this to operate but you will need ac power for a converter box
having just come through ike in houston and  days without power my portable tv was a lifeline i cannot be without
the gov needs to supply digital portable tvs or some other solution to the disaster prone coasts and other areas
i guess the cheaper solution is to buy a  generator to power the converter box
sheeesh
what about my portable batterypowered analog television
will i be able to use it to watch broadcast television after february  portable batterypowered analog televisions may be able to receive overtheair programming after february   if they are connected to a digitaltoanalog converter box
because battery powered digitaltoanalog converter boxes are not currently available an external power source would also be required
if local utility power service is not available an external battery power station or an emergency power generator may be able to supply the necessary power for the converter boxa portable device with more bulk than expected in size
it performs poorly outside even with placing it under an umbrella and inside a backpack
i used to own another casio portable tvthat performed better and was much smaller
inside it fulfills my expectations
screen is small and you have squint watching
knowing what i know now i would not buy again or recommendmy understanding is that linear polarizers dont work well with some modern camera functions such as auto focus so i bought this circular filter
well the effect of the circular polarizer isnt anywhere near as dramatic and useful as the linear as i remeber things from  mm film days
so since i mostly use a polarizer for wide angle landscape shots i think ill use a linear and focus manuallyif linear filters dont mess up auto focus andor metering on dslrs i invite correctionoverall it okay for the price
im not thrilled by it but it does the jobive had two other circular polarizing filters and this just doesnt seem to do quite as well as those did
however its satisfactory and certainly good to have in your bag when you need it
given the price of circular polarizing filters unless you really need one often or have need of a topnotch cp filter for a demanding shot this will do quite well
nothing spectacular but no significant complaint either using a nikon dnot much exciting about a polarizer it either works or it doesnt and this one does
however better take a filter wrench along
it tends to be difficult to remove
i keep a uv filter also a hoya on my camera to protect the lens and no matter how hard i try the polarizer gets stuck and is difficult to remove by hand
most unhandy when trying to remove it quickly who wants to fool around with a wrench at that pointit did its job but ive used better and cheaper polarizers in my life time so good but not greaton ocassion i would have trouble mounting it on my cannon xsi dslr because the cannons cheap kit plastic lens has to mate with hoyas metal screw threads
so this is more a dig at cannoni ended up purchasing these from frys for about  and quickly returned them
here at amazon for  id say theyre a good value for what they can doi tested these on the amtrak northeast corridor and on a roundtrip from the west to east coast via airplanewhile it doesnt eliminate all noise it did make a significant reduction in lowfrequency noises
on the airplane it significantly reduced the lowfrequency engine noise if i had to quantify it id say a    reduction in perceived loudness in lowfrequency noiseas stated in the manual these do no affect highfrequency noise
examples of unaffected noise midtohigh frequency engine noise quotwhooshquot of air conditioning vents overhead people and panel rattles train track squealing babies crying etci found these uncomfortable to wear for more than about  hours
the shapeposition of the ear pads applies pressure unevenly on my ears
that said i find that most lowcost under  headphones have the same problemso it may just be mei probably snagged the inline control unit at least about  times on a single flight
i would definitely recommend an integrated control instead of inline unit for anyone considering noise canceling headsetssome tangible benefits less throbbingringing in my ears after the flight ends
 could hear the dialog in movies at volume  instead of  perhaps related to previous
 made listening to classicalinstrumental bearable on the airplane
 significantly reduces the low murmur heard in public places like an airporttrain terminal
 in quieter environments whitenoise may help drown out minortitinussome problemsshortcomings high frequency noise is not affected
 uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time
 doesnt feel secure on my head
 external control is very annoying especially for us coachclass flyers
 inline control is annoyingi give these  stars due to its good benefitstocost ratio
for comfort i would give it  stars
hence a star ratingexpectation before buy  fullfilment  sensitivity  selectivity  did not have a chance to test in a crowded spectrumfeatures   no bass boost definitely a missing addition audio power  will definitely deafen you 
miss bass boost though ggggrrrr 
after reading the other reviews i felt this was the model i waslooking for since everybody was praising its sensitivity and selectivitylooked the nice pictures and decided to buy itthe first disappointment the display does not highlitesighthere is no bass boost feature it is a nice addition unlessyou use a really good pair of headphonesand talking about the headphones the radio come with earbudsthat does provide a reasonable good sound but they dont fitin my right ear i must have some genetic ear mutationthe buds are a bit bulky and there is no padding what make themslip off pretty easy and being bulky you will get sore earsafter a little time wearing themfirst thing i did was to go to walmart and get a pair of thosebehind the ears model since i want to use the radio in the gymto shut off those idiotic shows on the tv
im happy with this solution
anywaythe controls are simple enough and once you put all the stationsyou like on the memories you use one button to scroll themthere is only one memory scroll button so you always navigateforward and once it reaches the th it will flip to st againa distinctive feature of the memory is that you can fill it inwith any combination of am and fm there is no separation so youmay find it annoying to have mixed stations to select fromi like this feature but after a week with it i think i am backto wishing they were separated
there is not enough fm stationsthat the gadget will pick up to fill  memories  and topreset some crap in there just doesnt pay offtoo bad one cannot cancel some unused memories i would probably get rid of about  of them 
another feature that made me chose this model is that it usesxaa batteries as opposed to aaaive been using it for  weeks now with rechargeables nimh and its working greatthe radio comes also with a clip to attach to the belt itfeels a little flimsy though ie
not suited to the gym nowi think that a armstrap would work bestthe buttons are soo sensitive that i think a summer draft would activate themthere is a lock button to prevent accidental operation but ifound it a bit annoyng to use itfor the reception it did better than a few boomboxes i broughtto the office i really like listening to the radioactually less than  radio stations were possible to listen tothe radio has a monostereo switch that helps to get rid ofthe buzzing when the fm reception is weak and i had to use itall the time in the office however when you change station the reception defaults back to stereoi am completely disappointed though that it cannot get thesignal of my favorite radio station neither in the office or the gymtv band 
who cares 
i want to be away from the tv am i happy with it 
finally something i forgot to talk before the auto shutoff
it will turn your radio off in  minutes unless you change something on the controls not counting on volume or lockif you want it to be on by your side for more than one hour on the same station you better hit something like monostereo just to reset the timer
its great for those who like to sleep with it since the feature will save your batteriesok right off the bat i will say that i do not yet own this sangean radio
i am in a quest to replace the optimus  portable radio that i bought for some  or  not even two years ago from radio sh  
sorry for the language but it seems they sell junk discontinue it and try to charge you an arm and a leg to repair it
as a longtime avid user of pocket radios since i was a kid listening to baseball games as i fell asleep at night i have owned several portable amfm radios over the last  years
most of them were very cheap and worked for a couple or a few years before breaking downusually just the volume adjuster would get all statickyie it still worked but it was incredibly frustrating fighting with the volume knob all the timebut you would just go out and buy another one for a few bucks and all was well againwell when one went out a couple of years ago i decided to try to find a higher quality radio so that i could avoid the usual  years and out syndrome 
i walked into a radio shack and lo and behold this optimus was there
it had everything i wanted and liked and then some but was rather expensive at it was very small and thin builtin speaker digital tuning sleep function for bedtime listening a clip for wearing on a belt or shirt and it had a few features that i had never had before that i also likeddigital clock lock button alarm onetouch memory select weather band and a tv band
i had struck gold untilbut this one died alsoprobably even sooner than most of the cheapies ive owned
suddenly it started acting weirdcutting outand then soon therafter nothingyou can hear that it has power because there is a low barely audible hissing sound but no stations come in and none of the features workno readout no clock no volume control nothingjust a very low buzzing soundso i emailed radio shack explained my absolute enthusiasm for this radio when it worked and my sheer disappointment that a  radio died after just a year or two of use
they emailed back a few days later saying take it to your local radio shack and theyll send it in for repair
i thought great
so i took it in with the email in handand was promptly told well of course youll still have to pay for the repair and quite frankly it isnt worth it
youll pay more for the repair than you did for the radio
i walked out the first time but came back a few weeks later paid my money and sent it in
then it came back
they said that they are unable to repair it
radio shack no longer makes this particular onoff switch
sorry and good luck
what a joke
they will not stand behind a  transistor radio that breaks after  yearsand there is no way to have it repairedand now i am once again trying to find a radio that will work for more than a yeari bought a jensen digital tuning radio with builtin speaker from meijer for about  a few days ago and have already returned it
it was an absolute nightmare trying to navigate and program the thing
everything took more than one button push often three or fourjust ridiculousand when the batteries went dead and you replaced them you lost all of your presetseven if you do a quick battery switch
unrealso anyway this is just a sad state of affairs
seems you must pay upwards of  minimum to get a radio with decent featuresand then youre likely to have it die on you within a year anywayterribly frustrateddbcons ive had an older dt amfm sangean pocket radio for a about  years
i bought it from c crane up in northern california
ive had many pocket radios for nighttime listening to talk and sports and for travel
the sangean was ok until it slipped out of my pocket once
after that i had to keep it as a night table radio as moving it caused an e to light up on the screen and then it just turned itself off
the buttons on the face do not allow people like me with big hands to touch it while operational without changing the stations and whatever afterwhich you have reset it
the front buttons are very  sensitivewhen it failed c crane said its out of warranty sorry and thats all she wrote
finally it just had the e in the display continuously so i pronounced it dead
if you get one of these remember it may look portable but if you touch one of those front buttons it will change stations and if you drop it you can kiss it goodbye
i have two old sonys and an old ge all of which are workhorses and still working
the sangean cost the most and lasted the shortest period of timepros it had good reception and it was very clear and easy to hear with our without earbuds or pillow speaker
the autooff button was great for nighttime listening
good idea but not robust for regular useextremely disappointed with the reception of this pocket radio
external antenna or earbuds doesnt seem to hold a station when the orientation of the radio itself changes ie
when you turn a corner while walking
my old coby did that but i expected this priced radio to perform much better
would not recommend to anybodythis radio is a little bulkier than i expected
the functionalities are pretty basic digital tuning station presets and amfm band switch etc
i works well in the last month or so
i use it when biking to work
the cspan radio signal used to be very weak when i was using a sony fm tuner on an mp plaer
it is better now
but the diference is not that huge
while the sony player is the size of a thumb drive this one is the size of a deck of cards
as soon as i enter the hallway my office building the signal immediately start to crack
but overall it is not disappointing
i just feel when you have a radio of this size it should be a lot more powerful in receiving signals and resolving them betterwhat is with these guys that they have not figured how to do a direct tune radio
who wants to scan thru  stations to get to the one you want
even my  mercury offered this as well as radio shack on several models some  years ago in their pocket radios
even radio shack dropped this feature which for the life of me i do not understand
sony makes a neat little push button model but it requires that you walk around with some dumb earphones plugged into your ears all dayno speakercmon guys we already have  different models of mp players cant we get one decent pocket radio with push button tuning
if cost is the issue drop the dumb tv tuner that never works well anyhowhere it is two years later and still no push button direct tune radio
of course we have seen another couple hundred new cell phones and another  mp players but no one has yet the sense to build the same radio that radio shack offered some  or more years agonow i find that even my new carmercedes the idiots
now forces me to scan thru a bunch of stations because of their insipid idrive like system
no more direct tuning here either i guess they think it is a good idea to take your eyes off the road to change stations on your radio
what next will see the same thing from directv on our television setsmay   after owning this radio for a while i have found it to be the best of what i have found currently available
tuning is better than other sangaens sound quality is a bit nasal even with setting toward more bass reception is somewhat marginal on  and  am in sf bay area
was going to order up a nd one for backup and today stumbled over another radio on amazon that look more interestingmade by ccrain
is a pocket radio with real direct tuning buttons
push a button and you are at another stationlike your car radio
what a brilliant conceptof course radio shackoptimus brand had the same feature  years ago on a couple of their models which unfortunately have been out of production for many years
as far as i can determine and i have been looking for many years this ccrane is the only model from any manufacturer that offers this convenient featurejust ordered one up today
hopefully will all i expect it to be
is a bit expensive at  bucks but worth it to me if i get my push button tuning and decent performanceincidentally i had to call crane directly to assure myself that push button tuning was a real feature of this radio
the amazon write up is a bit vague on this and the photos helped not at allshows  buttons but not labeled as  thru i just upgraded this sangean on my edited review to  stars as performance is somewhat okbetter than other radios that i have tried over the yearsincluding a couple of other sangean models that were truly marginalthe am reception is ok without earphones but the fm is worse than poor unless you live next to the station
it advertises great sangean performance but thats a joke
i also own the sagean internet radio that sells for   and sounds as bad as a n coby clock radio in a motel just as an asideif you want a great internet radio get a logitech squeezeboxit yields audio that sounds like its pricemy first delivery had to be sent back
the hand lever had completely broken off so it was useless
the second one arrived with no damage
so far its a like
i could spend the cash on a more expensive one but really didnt see why since i wont be using it that muchit is slightly heavier than expectedi had purchased a personal sony tape recorder from amazon that came with its own power cord
unfortunately in one of the times i knocked it off my computer desk the plug end broke so i needed a replacement
after being pretty sure this adapter would fit it i ordered it
when it arrived i plugged one end into the ac jack on the recorder then plugged the other end into my circuit breaker and was relieved that it worked
it is because i have no cd player at this time that i needed something to play my cassette tapes on and the sony fit the bill
so it was nice to find a replacement for the power cord that was compatible with the recorder
at least if i need to replace it in the future i know what to purchasefine product but it injects noise to some am radio stationsno problem with fmi bought it as a world  vac replacement for a  vac supply i plugged into a  vac mains in viet nam
it has a bit of rf noise
the sony icf  i got it for is a general coverage receiver
its very sensitive and picks up the noise from the switching power power supplythis product received good reviews but it would not work with my  toyota
seems more car markers have proprietary radios that dont allow addon disc players
before you order do some research to determine if you can use this item in your newer carthis model is probably out of production since all tv broadcasts are not digital
the radio works fine
i like the weather radio feature although it is unable to receive any but analog television signalsi like this radio alot
i think its a nice compact package and a features a great digital tuning with the ability to listen to the weather and tv signals
however turning it up to near the loudest setting which i have to do when i am in the shower you get an incredible amount of distortion
nice radio good speakers when on a low volume setting but up high the sound is really lousycons  femine design looks like a clutch purse with no handle no power supply included amazon sells the sony acea power supply which sony states it is not for this radio and the sony recommended power supply is acehgwhich i can not find on the internet even on sonys home pagepro am  fm sound quality is very good for this size radio exact digital tuneing is easy weather band is weak along with the tv band and i live in florida only  miles from the ocean
lock in a station is a great idea so it wont change when you accidently touch the tunner until you unlock it
over all it seems to be a good purchasei like everything about the radio except the battery lifetime
it cuts out at certain voltage when the battery is not completely dead
so i have to change the batter more frequently  weeks than the other radios i had  weeksmy wife has used one of these for several years and likes it very much
for its size it has better than average sound quality
am and fm reception are good
tv reception is ok but the sangean dtv is better on weaker stations
wx reception at our location is weak but usablethis radio does not have a backlight and uses  aa cells for power i keep the extra cell from a pack in the refrigerator for the next changeso this is not a big problemthis radio does not have a weatheralert functionfor better  wx reception and potentially lifesaving weatheralert alarm consider one of the midland radios offered on this site
see my review of midland wrupdate april  as a result of the switch from analog to digital tv in the us the analog channels will be turned off feb   the tv audio band of this radio and others like it will no longer receive tv audiothe biggest feature i use is the sleep timer am radio puts me to sleep what can i say
but the no light thing is really dumb why would they leave that out
yeesh if i didnt have a pair of night vision goggles i wear to bed i would be lost
i also like to feature that blocks out bushs voice and inserts easy listening jazz
im not a jazz fan  but im starting to bedid not work how i wanted but was easy to install as alternate methodlittle noisy but no real difference then any other fan i have ever installled works well enough very loud fan though gonna buy another somewhere and toss this one in the junk drawer
wordlittle too loud for my taste but cools nicely
it get great movement through my pc
i may put a fan controller on it to quiet it down a bitworks fine but whines slightly
not annoyingly loud but slightly more than just fan noise
quieter than the old one it replaced
comes with a t  pin connector and adapter for  pin molex
overall reasonable value at  and free shippingi have had this velbon tripod for a couple of years but i rarely use it
instead i use a bogenmanfrotto b digi tripod with ball head
the bogen is  pound heavier
it is also  taller at  with the column raised
the bogen is a much stiffer tripod with a much better ballhead on top
both tripods claim to support cameras up to  pounds but i find that more believable with the bogen than the velbon
i actually bought the velbon first and found the bogen to be so much more of what i wanted that i bought that second
i am keeping the velbon for those occasions eg
backpacking where that  pound makes a difference and i will only be using a light digicamerato be honest the screwdriver is a bit too fat
i do not like it it also feels like a cheap plastic
if you replace the screw driver with a higher end one the set isnt badbought this wide angle lens and adapter for my canon a to shoot lots of interior shots of rooms as i am a house remodeler
lens makes great wide shots to encompass a small room and all its features
where this lens fails in that the size of the adapter and lens is so large hanging out the front of the camera that it blocks half of the flash when shooting
the result is that most of the entire right half of your photos will be dark or have a prominate shadow
this camera is the second a i have had because it has all the features i needed and makes great photos otherwise
my only workaround this shadow problem is to now invest more  money into a slave strobe unit
all combined its making the cost of this camera skyrocket compared with investing in a  higher grade digital  camera with interchangable lenses and flash adaptersfirst off i must say i love my a
it has the features i want other than zoom range plus the rather smallish size is nice after toting  slr bodies and  lenses around for years
this wide angle conversion lens is nothing special though and has some limitations
noticeable barrel distortion but it should not be a problem if your subject has no straight lines in it
need to use lcd for precise framingviewing
the adaptor sticks out about  inches and the lens is about an inch and they are mm diameter therefore it blocks about  of the view through the finder
flash not recommended because the adaptorlens blocks about  of the flash coverage causing a shadow on the bottom right corner
not a problem outdoors
only for use at widest angle setting
essentially it makes your zoom camera a fixedfocal length camerathe largish size and black plastic finish sort of throws off the style of the a itself
comes with front and rear slipon plastic caps and a pouch
im not thrilled but for  i guess it is ok within its limitationsi like the results  but the shadow produced when using flash  is not acceptable it ruins the shoti installed this hard drive in a used pc i purchased
though there are no instructions installation was pretty straight forward
i shopped prices and could not beat amazons price
would recommend this to anyone needing a replacement drive at a bargain priceencouraged by a raving bryan peterson i decided to get myself a d closeup lens
it probably delivers  i was just expecting more out of itthe good very well made before you say one metal ring and two glass elements what could go wrong  i can give you an endless list of needlessly shoddy built cheap accessories
its also easy to use and it comes in a container similar to some that you put filters in the screw model but it doesnt open as easily
which is good since i usually find my filters at the bottom of my bag and the container open unlike the container this lens comes in
distortion and sharpness remain well defined  the optical quality of this design is without complaints from methe bad it enlarges the images but not by a tremendous amount
id say about x
that allows you to get closer than without it but not as close as id want to
obviously a macro lens will do betterbut unlike a macro lens this doesnt break the bank and doesnt take up significant space or weight in your bag either
if like me you have a daily camera bag this is a great addition
if youre a hiker who wants great shots of flowers consider bringing a real macro lens
and if you cannot afford that consider a reverser ring and a cheap mm or mm used manual focus that goes with it insteadi bought these to get my wires off the ground away from my baseboard heaters
does the trick but glad that its hidden for the most part
not the best looking racewayi ordered two raceways and unfortunately have to return them both
my experience pretty much reflects both reviews so far
the item is greyvery grey
i also viewed the pic as being offwhite but no its a medium to mediumdark grey
mine also came in at  instead of 
i do like the slim profile but  is too big for my application
finally one of the raceways arrived bent
of course i dont blame the seller for the damage but ive found that once bent the raceway wont snap shut
the plastic retains this memory and the only solution is to cut the bend outedit  good
looks like amazon changed the description to reflect the correct dimensions although a better picture to reflect the real color might also helpi have had this for  months and use it regularly for work
i use my recorder with and without the microphone and i honestly cant tell a difference
i dont even know if it works or not
i have asked a few of my peers and they cant tell a difference either
i hope this doesnt stop anyone from purchasing one this is not my intent mearly my honest reviewi could not use it  it turns out will not work on a stereo recorderwhen i ordered this microphone it had pictures of all the accessories i thought came with it such as other covers and an extension cord so you can clip the mic onto other things
but when it showed up all it had was the mic with the one cover thats in the picture
when i went back to the product page on amazon the pictures were changed to just the image of the mic that i got
im not sure if it was a mistake to begin with or someone trying to get more salesi bought these as replacement covers for some koss headphones
i thought the covers i was buying were round but they are actually very oval and are bigger than i realized  they have a hard time staying on the average sized earpieces of my koss headphones
i wouldnt buy these againit works fine but the color is blackpicture is grey
not a big deal to me but if you want a certain color i got blackyou might already know this but if you have a monitor that only supports a dvi input this will not work to get the vga out out to work to this monitor
vga is not a digital signal and dvi is so going from analog to digital is not possible without a converter of sorts
this is not why i bought this but i figured id test it with a mac monitor i had laying around just out of curiosity
didnt think it would work and it doesnt
it does work to connect a dvi output from a video card to a vga input of a monitoras i said you may know this but i thought it may be helpful to mentionfigured i would put up this review just in case anyone else might be inclined to make the same mistake as i did
if you have a dvi port from your motherboard and a vga monitor  this will not work unless you have a dvi cable as well
i had to return it its a connector it works it was cheap enough and i sure this is my second review of this producti needed a  and bought this not realizing it wouldnt fit
im not going to downrate because of my mistake
but i have heard that a dvi will not be able to convert to vga in the case of your dvi being analog and not digital
if you have a analog dvi output and buy an adapter to convert it to digital it will not work in most cases
some of these adapters are pointless unless you know whether or not your output is analog or digital and what your input will be able to work withso this does not work in use with a kvm
that was the sole purpose of this purchase
so keep that in mindi bought this adapter for my computer monitor and is magnificentfirst off let me say i have purchased several cables from cables to go and usually have had a good experience especially given the price point
but alas things didnt work out super peachy this timei got this cable to charge an ipod shuffle with a generic but quite reliable wall chargersadly this cable does not work with that charger
nothing happens when i plug in the shuffle
and yes the charger is working finethis cable does work however with apples  w wall charger
i hadnt planned on using this cable with apples overpriced charger but so it goesfinally be forewarned the cable pictured is not the one you will getor at least it isnt the one i just got in the mail
i bought this same cable a year ago from the same seller and that one looks exactly like the picture complete with a tidy plastic enclosure around the female end of the cable
that cable workedand still worksperfectly plus it looks nice sitting on my desktopthe cable i received just now has a naked metal female coupling and the cable itself is  the width of the one i purchased a year ago
so it doesnt work universally and it is much cheaper and uglier than the white  cable cablestogo used to sellin sum think twice if either the aesthetics of this white cable matter to you or if you plan to use this cable with a generic usb wall chargeri do have a core like this in my room i bought it mainly to extend the reach to recharge my ps controller it can also be to extend the range of your webcam so you can show friends how you play games i bought this to add some length to my ipad charging cable
unfortunately it slows the charging rate to about  of the normal rate
usually the ipad will fully charge over night but with the extra usb cable it only gains about  of a charge in that time
otherwise the cable seems to be fineit is only really good as an extension but did not serve the purpose that i originally bought it forwhen i bought these they worked really good
purchased from amazon directly
great price too but after about amonth of use it seems not to work so great anymore
it was worth a shot just wish it would have worked longerthe product works cheap cost wise and standard however the shipment came from asia and it took more than  weeksthe modem i bought from att ended up having a set of  phone couplers with the delivery of the modem
so kept it just in case anywayssometimes i have a need for a longer cable or at least somewhere between the  and  cables i have
this is a great way to extend the lengthneither amazons listing nor cable to gos website say anything about this coupler being cat
there are a number of reviews that call this cat but i dont see what they base this on
if youre using this for the ubiquitous basetx ethernet commonly found in homes and businesses i would stick with something that clearly indicates it is rated for cat such asneewer ethernet connector adapter cable coupler for rj cati can only recommend this coupler for a very short extension no more than  ft  any run longer will likely run into issues
i tested this through a cable analyzer and found a huge db loss when using this coupler
i ended up using a keystone jack which greatly reduced the db loss for my long run of ftthe crimping action of this tool works fine but the wire cutterstripper is pretty iffy
you are better off to slice lightly around the jacket removing about an inch and a half and then lining up and flattening the necessary strands and cutting to length about  for r and  for r
easier to work with that way and less errorsits about  little packets of plain white thermal grease
it is not antec branded as the product photo shows though the packets do have the same logo on them as what is seen in teh product photo
i will add a user pic showing what you actually geti really like the ease of printing labels that simply stick to my cds to show me what i have put on the cd
ive never had any problems personally but i have heard of one problem
i put a label on a final project for my graduate program at college
im not sure how but the label came off inside my professors cd drive
he couldnt view my project and his cd drive had to be taken apart and cleaned
im a little more cautious now when labeling my cdsi actually had to create my own label templates for this product on microsoft office word  because the memorex software was ancient  from   and wouldnt allow me to upload my own images to use on the cd labels
instead it gives you a bunch of cheesylooking clip art images to useunless you want to go through the trouble of creating your own template and potentially wasting a few labels in the process go with something like avery which has free word templates available on its site without the unnecessary restrictions of the memorex software
if you want to go through the hassle of create separate templates for your discs and say envelope address labels  since no one really uses jewel cases anymore then i suppose that this would be the cheaper longterm alternativewhile the product does what i bought it for it is extremely difficult to remove the label from the backing
several labels were torn and the center knockout is also hard to removeive owned this now since  there were complaints by some sites that the fan runs loud or often
i hadnt noticed until the battery is used and then it recharges when power returns and the fan kicks in to cool
i use this in my home so noise is importantideally this was less than apc for a va rack mount
my needs were for an av rack to backup gaming av receiver and wireless access point in that rack
lets say i dont want to lose a three hour gaming session when the power blipsi believe cyberpower has replaced this model with orpfcrtu or even the business model prlcdrtxlu
far more costly but have pfc and pure sinewave for sensitive electronicsif i had to replace this i would stay with cyberpower but get one of the ones above as they offer lcd for status and more features
apc offered an aventertainment ups and conditioner but twice the pricepros inexpensive to comparable models removable batteries rackmountcons bad design for access of battery removalscrews to remove connectors screws to remove tray screws to access batteries noisy fan unless in loud environment or data closettip those complaining of loud or frequently running fan should check the batteries
there are four leadacid ah batteries in the tray two in series each
i noticed after frequent fan running that even though the unit passed builtin test one of the batteries appear swelling over the other three
i replaced all  at around  total
no more frequently running fan
and that batteries were  years old and mark the batteries when you replace them with monthyearst you will need to heat the unit in boiling or almost boiling water for a while
but that does help with the offgassing smell too
take it out of the hot water be careful it holds quite a bit and lay it flat it should stay with no problem if not back into the soupthe slot is not designed for thin cables and if you plan to use them you also need to plan to close the slot with painters tapeif you plan to use two sided tape to hold it in place break down and go buy some m brand that really sticksits alright
it is really annoying to try and straighten especially the center half of the strip
trying to straighten it out just makes the cable channel gap and not hold the cords in
it is acceptable with some heavy duty tape but frustratingthis will indeed conceal cables but i never could get it to lay flat
i tried laying it out flat with weight on it rolling it the other way cursing at it etc
and nothing kept the end from whipping back into a coilalso if you plan to stick it down which youll need to do buy some extra tape
the supplied roll isnt nearly enoughthis works ok to conceal a single power cord
i wanted to hide  speaker cables and a phone cord and found that it had barely enough room in the channel to fit those  relatively thin cablesit arrives in a coil as shown and takes a couple of days to relax and flattenthis cord concealer was cheap and thats exactly what it is
it came in a  foot section all rolled up
that means it now wont stay flat on the ground covering your cables
its okay if you run one cord through it but forget about more than that
this concealer is meant for one cord and is not very durablecomes in a package rolled up as expected which makes setup difficult as it is hard to get to lay flatipurchased  of these cable protectors
each unit was roled in a box
when uncoiled the product would not lay flat even after weighting it down for several days
i had to cut the end off of each unit and it still curled
if i need to have power cables laid out on the floor i would look for another solutiondoes the job and a good price
it took way too much effort to straighten it out though
i soaked it in a hot bath tub as another reviewer suggestedi needed a cord concealer to get a power cord and a headphone cable from the media center to the couch
i picked up the belkin  foot cord concealer from a different vendor for  so i thought that was a good dealfirst it comes rolled up so if you want to use it right away plan on using the double sided tape to stick it to the floor to keep it flat
if you have time though you can place it in a window or outside and let the sun warm it up to make it loose its memory of being curled
then you dont necessarily need to stick it to the floor unless you want toi do want to make everyone aware that this is not  feet of product even though thats what its marked as on the box and in the description
the product is actually only   feet long
so keep that in mind when doing your measurements
luckily for me i only needed a  foot run
before i bought the belkin product i pucked up a different brand that was labeled as  feet and it was really only   feet so im guessing this is a standard practice for this type of product they advertise it as a half foot longer than it actually isthe center channel where you put your cable is wide enough to take a thicker gauge power extension cable plus a thinner gauge cable 
the triangle shaped channels on either side of the main channel are not designed to put cables into
if you needed extra capacity you could cut your own slit on the underside to make use of those triangle channels but they dont come usable out of the boxi wish they had more color selections than tan and grey i would have really liked a white one or even black
other than the colors not being ideal im happy with the job the concealer is doing the dog doesnt keep catching the cables in her paws anymore and it looks way nicer than duct taping the cables to the floorif you dont have a lot of time to uncurl and straighten this concealer look elsewhere
i read all of the reviews and now believe the ones saying it was difficult to uncurl
i had the middle of the strip flat in no time by reversing the roll for an hour but the ends still are not flat
i will be cutting off the ends to get the results i need
i do not have the ability to boil this strip here in the office as one reviewer suggested
i have used other brands that are heavier plastic but easier to uncurl and get to lie flatthis product does exactly what it says it will do
there is some doublesided tape to tape it to the floor but it doesnt cover the entire cord concealer
the way this item is designed it actually needs double the length of tape that comes with it
that being said it lays pretty flat and works well
i put it under a door and the door doesnt seem to damage it all given the frictionlike other reviewers stated you need to flatten out the concealer first
i didnt try the hot water but just putting weights on it for a while will be sufficientok i found this product and fits my need at much lower price than local store with longer length
i also followed the suggestion of simmering with hot boiling water before flatten it out but the effect was not as good as the other brand local store carrythe biggest complain is the cable was not been able to be kept inside the trench and next one is the bottom was bumpy even after hot water treatment
maybe it is too long that curled more when packed for shipping
i wish it could be shorter if that fixes the issuei like this compared to other brands because it has a much larger duct or space to insert cablescords
its also easier to put cablescords in and out of
however that means if you move the concealer around etc
those cablescords are more likely to fall out vs others that have ducts with a tightersmaller opening
it still retains some of the curve from when it was wound in the packaging
as i spread open the duct to insert cables the opening never really closed back and the edges wont lay flat on the floor
like all concealers ive tried the rubber gets easily scuffedscratched and shows dirt after time
this is a fairly dark grey maybe lighter than shown in the picture though
still much better than wiremold which doesnt lay flat at all at least this modelwiremold cdb feet corduct cord protector brownwhich as has a much smaller openingduct and seems prone to show even more wear
the concealers ive bought at office supply chain stores seem to work better and lay flat even those those might also be belkin
so i guess take it or leave it
i myself will be going back to the chain store to find the one that actually works as expectedif youre looking for something long term get something else
unfortunately i myself havent been able to find products that are that much better
still i feel that theres gotta be something better than thesethis item is just ok it is easy to cut with a razor blade to size
biggest issue is the permanent curl
i have been trying to get it to flatten out under a rug for weeks and it still wants to curl back upthe double backed tape doesnt stick to the carpet well and it wants to curl back up into a roll like you wouldnt believe
its nearly impossible to keep it stuck down and not tripping people which was the goali took the advice of other reviewers
to get rid of the curl i soaked it in hot water
works great nowthis product ships coiled and does not like to flatten out
put something large and heavy i used a laserdisc player and a vcr at each end for a few days to help flatten it out
still has the tendancy to want to curl up a bit
once this is flattend out it does do the jobit works for a lot of people but there are a couple different lines of kingston one of which wouldnt work in my delli gave only  stars because i never got chance to use it
before i received this my mac pmu power management unit massed up and i pulled out  hds  optical drives video card and ordered  external drive enclosures and using and use them with my other macscheap construction and feelthin cable works fine thoughhavent noticed any problems with interference
i expected a bit better quality out of a name brand like belkinwork find for a used equipmentbut do drop out signal for a little bitif you leave it on leave it off for the night only on during the morning for  seem to work finddont used this modem modelif you have internet signal more than mb the internet signal seem to drag not stream to the max even not during peak hours during  pm am on the weekendto be honest these units are very problematic unless you get one that is tested right there in front of you but this is the same with most of these broadband modemsrouterswifi units
if you want to see what i mean then try ordering broadband service from one of your stateowned telephone providers and ask for this service
we all witness these guys bring  or  boxes with them
i have seen one man drive away and come back twice with a load of them
basically it is hit or miss with them so maybe renting is a good idea
no  okay here is low down if you get a working one
setup on xp is easy as xp detects it but use the disk to see who has the latest drivers
install
get your isp service setup
start adsl device
login and away you go with your new mb connection if that is what you want
if the device is good however then it does it what it was intended to do
to be honest with these devices it is not really about the brand name but finding one that works without bugs star if it does not work
 stars if it does
 stars all round with these productsive owned this bag for about a yeari dont carry it everyday
perhaps twice a week i would carry it with my dell  laptop with its power supply mouse cd case and other small itemsthe bag is good enough size for my purpose and i like it alotthe only thing i dont like about it is that the handle on the top is beginning to fall off
so i carry it by the backstrapsthe junk it compartment is rarely used though it can be very useful to somei have to give it a star because of its workmanship on the handle
im afraid when the backstrap might go as wellother than that its a good bag especially the fact that it doesnt scream i have a laptop within methe first one i got shipped from amazon didnt work at all it sucked
it didnt work in any digital camera i usedbut theres a warranty on it so you just need to call sandisk send it in and theyll replace it for you the one they sent me seems to be a different model or something and it works fineso if you dont want to have to go through the whole replacement process get a different cardused this on a palm device
both are now beyond obsolete but sandisk is still my favorite brand of portable storage cardnot exactly what i was looking for but got it promptly and it does work just fine
no problems with iti agree with the other reviewer who said this bag is not small
i think it depends on your taste  but for me i was expecting a small bag that was just a little bigger than my kodak camera
i was planning on attaching it to my belt
for my expectations this was way too big and i too returned the itemone of the things that make this bag big is the pouch in front
its hard to see in the picture but this pouch definitely adds to the thickness of the whole bag a side profile would have shown this thicknessbut the quality is very good  if size is not important to you id say this is a good buy
but if youre like me and youre expecting it to be small forget about this onethis is too big in size and is not very attractivethe title of my review sums up this bag  its nice but its big
it says size small so i dont know if maybe i am missing some fine print or i got sent the wrong bag but this bag is rather large for my very compact kodak v camera
dont get me wrong i will still use it i was just hoping for a more compact case
i used a gift certificate to buy this but had i actually paid for it i probably would be sending it backthis is another logitech webcam which doubles as a digital camera
the webcam is able to record video and still images but no sound
although the  is a basic webcam model it has one feature it can double as a digital camera
just unplug it and take it away from the computer for all your ebay photographs or other photo emergency uses when you dont have a better digital camera around
the camera holds mb worth of images
you need  aaa batteries to turn the webcam into a digital camera
the swivel base on which the plastic webcam normally sits doubles as the docking port for downloading images from the digital camera
there is no lcd screen for you to preview images when you take them just a simple viewfinder so beware of parallax errors when you snap something close upi recently purchased a new imac and external harddrive as a back up and wanted a little extra secure feeling knowing that my stuff is bolted down
this product fit well as it is a twinlock system
the cable itself is very stiff and pulls the external over ifwhen i tilt the imac
the locks dont really fit as snug as i would like they kinda feel like they arent on properly
the cable however is very long
i would recommend this product for larger heavier items that dont move often like for dvrs dvd players etc  this product works with a canon i and windows xp in ethernet mode
the wireless option was not testedthe documentation for setup and configuration is inadequate
if you are using this product with a canon i and windows xp i have the following suggestions for installation  throw out the linksys quick start guide
attach the i directly to your computer and install the canon print driver
install the linksys biadmin utility from the linksys startup cd using the autorun installation
attach printer to print server attach print server to network power up print server turn printer off and then on again
you should have a dhcp server on your network to assign an address to the print server
otherwise the print server will use the default failed dhcp address
using the biadmin configuration utility configure the printserver with a fixed ip address from your local network
save the configuration
recycle power on the print server
recycle power on the printer
install an ipp client from the linksys install cd
edriverippippclient  complete installation instructions from pages  to  of the  linksys user guide
the printer can now be accessed remotelynotesthis usb print server works with the canon i but it slows down the performance of the printer
this has little impact on plain text printing but it is very noticeable on photo printing
the extra flexibility of a network print server was worth the speed tradeoff
there are few choices for usb print servers with a wireless option
this is the best one availablei attempted to install the print server per the provided instructions
when i attempted to add the pcmcia card i did not get the indications stated
i called linksys customer service
after wading through their call screening process twice i finally reached a support technician
this process took about  minutes
i then had to repeat the entire process a third time because i could not understand the technician due to a heavy accent
i could understand the second technician that i talked to
i was given instructions by that technician that did not agree with the printed version
those directions worked and the unit began functioning
actually it was linked before that
i just was not aware of it
the instructions stated the wlan light should be on
it is never on steady it only flashes periodically
the last step of the instructions for the pcmcia card was to unplug the eithernet plug
this has to be done before the wlan light will begin blinkingbottom line the unit has worked fine for me once it was installed
the printed instructions and customer support leave a lot to be desired
in the case of the pcmcia card they are flatly incorrecti mostly use this player to work out
its nice and compact has very comfortable earphones that wont fall off and they breathe well
i agree with others that mp sound is great radio is worthless
the case with the clip makes it a little hard to get to the buttons
regardless the clip broke off and i emailed rio a few times to see if i could get a replacement since no one sells a replacement case
didnt get a useful response
two weeks later i called their  number a number of times but couldnt get a human
finally resorted to calling their longdistance number
after spending  minutes on the phone with someone i was told theyd have to order the part but it wasnt in stock call back in a week
a week later i called back and had to waste time resupplying them with all my info
they still didnt have the part but claimed theyd put it on backorder
well see what happens
so bottom line good mp and wma playertake good care of it because customer service is practically nonexistenti got this product because of the size expandability now it can supposedly take sd cards up to mb radio not a high priority and wearability is that a word
right off the bat the radio is worthless as everybody has said
dont buy this product for the integrated radio
it works okay if the transmitter is right in front of you like at the gym but thats about itsecondly the way it handles the expansion memory seems wierd to me when it comes time to transfer music over to the player you have to choose to transfer to the internal memory or external memory separately
this makes it difficult to build a playlist and just move the whole thing over it has a custom format for the memory
i would like to use my external card readerwriter to move music over and then put the card into the player
unfortunately after formatting the card in the rio my pc cannot read the card anymorethe arm band was also not well thought through
all it is a velcro strip that you have to wrap into the player holders belt clip
so when the player is attached to you it doesnt feel very stable
nikes psas have really well thought through arm bands not everything else thoughto be honest im not sure im going to keep this product
the size and expandability do not disappoint
the sound quality is great
if the above issues were resolved this would be the perfect mp playerthis product has been serving me well though it is not perfect
the sound is fine and i love the expandability
with a relatively inexpensive  mb sd card i have more than enough space for my long runs without having to convert my mps to a lower bit rate
the ear buds dont fit perfectly or sound fantastic but they are adequate and stay put while running eg during a  hour run i might resecure them once or twicethe physical quality is not that great
i am on my second unit the menu button broke on the first one
to rios credit getting the unit replaced was simple and painless
i dropped my second unit on a dirt road from about  feet and it popped apart
i was able to snap it back together but was not able to get it perfectly reassembledthe controls are not well designed for runners who would like to skip ahead or repeat songs in the play list
it uses one circular pad for  controls imagining a clock press  oclock for playpause   forward   stop and   back
the layout is intuitive but it is very easy to hit the wrong control while you are running eg press at the  oclock spot and you may get pause or forward
furthermore it is easy to unintentionally hit the large pad while trying to adjust the volume
it would be much better if they used  separate buttons that were a little less sensitive but i guess that would increase the cost a little
the controls can be locked by pressing menu and enter at the same time
although this will prevent you from unintentionally hitting the controls while running it is not useful if you want to make adjustments while you run
this has been a minor annoyance rather than a major problem
most of the time i hit play start running and never touch it againthe rio does not currently support the acc mepg audio format which means that users who buy music from the apple music store or otherwise use the acc format are out of luck for now
however since the rio is flashupgradable it is possible that it will be supported in the future
when i inquired with rio about their plans to support the new format i got the useless response that quotthe rio ss supports mp and wma file formatsquot which of course i already knew
they totally avoided my question and my follow up inquires have been ignoredpros sounds pretty good expandability clips to running shorts or arm bandcons not very rugged poorly designed controls for runners does not support acc filesthis person has obviously never owned this rio s his review reads like the blurb from the rios packaging yet he gushes on and on about it
clicking on his link i find that of his  reviews for amazon he dispenses nothing but  and  starsthis leads me to suspect that the guy gets paid to gush about whatever products by whomever is willing to pay him for his bogus reviews
either that or hes clairvoyant and only buys things that he knows ahead of time hell like
last possibility he is extremely easy to please and has very low standardsme im not going to pretend that i own this rio s so ill give it a  star rating just to keep it even
but i do wish amazon would do a better job of screening out paid hacks like this who seriously undermine the credibility of amazons users comments section which is one of their topmost featuresthis is a neat mp player for athletes
its small lightweight easy to use and sounds great
im a mac user and the player is compatible with itunes  and os  but you have to download a special itunes plugin from the website
the fm reception is okay here in los angeles keep in mind that the headphone cord is the players antenna the player can store  fm presets
the headphones fit okay but produce little bass
the player comes with mb builtin memory but for the price i think sonicblue should have included mb
the file transfers are fast and easy just draganddrop from itunes library to rio player icon
the player window is sufficiently backlit and shows datetime complete song info auto scrolling of long song titles is pretty neat
playback options include shufflerepeat  equalizer settings plus  custom basstreble and sound clarity is sharp
the player lets you set  different bookmarks so you can quickly jump to say track   the powersave mode options lets you extend battery life whether you use alkaline or nimh
the build quality of the player is very good and it has a nice grippy texture and the round shape with redsilvery white coloring looks cool
sound rating  stars easeuse rating  stars storage rating  stars
overall  starsgenerally i like the players size and how well it works while out and about
but its in no way perfect
heres what ive learned having very recently received my ss player
fm radio
everybody complains about it
theres some sort of tuning strength function on this device as when i press play while the tuner is active a different icon comes up and the signal seems to change
hmmm  stopwatch
hard to get to for being a quotsportsquot device
battery strength indicator
a lot of people complain about this one too
for those people note there is a battery type setting alkalinenimh
also with nimh also note theres different battery capacities
ive seen aaa range from  ma to over  ma depending on who made them and what you paid
battery properties such as voltage fall off rates in your battery affect how long this player will run on one charge
time and date
remove the battery and the quottunedquot station is remembered
butthe time and date need to be reset
this must be fixed
as a side note the player settings also revert to default after battery removal
why dont they just save to onboard memory
time i can understand but the general settings
installation
i too had problems which took  minutes to finally resolve
you must install the rio manager software which i found disappointing
all i know is that before installing the software the machine didnt recognize it and after a couple reboots it did
as a usb storage device windows quotshouldquot have assigned it a drive letter automatically
i use other player software which may now work but i just havent tried yet
do not use real one player
its just a conduit for being spammed with ads
i used to use it but found at least microsoft didnt spam me with ads using media player
menu
sometimes setting menu changes dont appear to take effect
i have to go back in and double check the settingsjust to correct the obvious  hundreds of thousands of apple extreme cards are being used  and its very likely many are being used more than  feet from a router
dont spread fudi have a an ibook g with apple extreme and it does fine even in the basement of our home  where the router is on the top floor
our office has  powerbooks  all with extreme cards  and we roam all around our building with very few weak spotsnetgear makes solid products but their userinterface is usually lacking and definitely not mac centric
smc is a better product imho  but if you are an apple user plunk the money for an apple airport  especially bs are available for about  on ebay and they are worth itthis one could be my back upamthis router served its purpose dutily but because technology advances so fast this device isnt operable with any of our new devices
if youre looking for a router make sure you have the  standard your devices run on ac is the newest and fastest n is the prior and still fast
most acn routers can backtrack too making this an obsolete purchasethis has a much better configuration interface than the linksys product but it wont talk to other wireless access points
if youre planning to use wireless in a large area this isnt the one for youi bought this to add to my existing wireless network but theres no way for it to acknowledge that another wireless network already exists and join to it
this is per their tech support who were at least competent and rapid in their response even if i didnt like the answerit works but signal strength not too good
i put it in one bedroom and my laptop can get connected in the other bedroom but not on the porch
my laptop can get signals from neighbors all places so it should not be the problem of the laptop and i believe its reasonable to hold the router responsiblemy wireless connection drops from time to time after connected for more than  hours or so
router needs to be reset by pulling the power plug
i used both linksys and netgear and i found the web interface offered by netgear is more intuitive
unfortunately the wireless connection did not work well with my orinoco wireless card
for  dollars its good for casual users
not recommended for heavy duty or professional usersfirst its a great router and from what i read the range is one of the best
that said it has a bug  if you leave connections idle it will autmotically close them
since i use this router for my work it means i have to constantly reconnect to various servers using ssh database admin program etc
thats when i found out the last official bios is from september of last year
netgear released a v version of the router and theyre no longer supporting this one vother than the above mentioned bug the router works great
easy to setup works with ppoe in europe etc
for people that complain about the signal andor range try changing the channel
the default for france is channel  and i got poor signals
i set the region to europe and channel  and my signal is excellent in another room through two solid concrete wallsthe wireless connectivity as well as the wired connectivity of this router is as good as any ive ever used
the issue with this router is that it cant seem to handle many secure connections
this issue has been confirmed by hundreds of other users on various message boards across the net
netgear tech support has no idea how to fix this and none of the fixes supplied by the community work either
until netgear releases firmware to fix this issue id stay away from itheres a small sample of the lost functionality websites that no longer work through this routeryahoo
mail various issuespizzahutcom customer loginweathercom entering zip codebellsouthcom customer loginthere are many more but you get the ideai had a couple of problems configuring my existing hp networked printer
four emails to support went unanswered
calling tech support was a waste of time
they did not want to help  they just wanted to repeat the same message over and over again there is no blockage
it have it cinfigured wrong
its working
it is coinfigured correctly  all in the same breathbottom line  they could notwould not help
i had to return it
they would rather lay blame elsewhere instead of help me solve the problem
i also wish manufacturers would hire people that can be understood
it looks like netgear jobs out support to pakistan or india
i called several times and everyone had the same thick accent  difficult to understandmy previous router was a netgear rt wired router
it worked perfectly requiring perhaps one restart a year
i added a dlink dwlap access point to the router and had problematic wireless capability
i later acquired a used linksys access point and had similar bad luck
since then i have installed for friends and one small business a variety of dlink and negear wireless routers
all have worked flawlessly
once i saw the price of the mr v drop i jumped at purchasing it as the reviews were quite good
i have been quite disappointed with my mr v purchase
it requires frequent resets
my first mr progressively required more and more resets and died
i was on the phone with the now notorous netgear tech support for over an hour and was told to return the product
i exchanged my mr for another one and was able to keep it up and running for over a week and it now requires a reset every couple of days
sometimes i can just power it down and back up
other times i must do a hard reset
it seems im not the only person with this problem
as far as the actual wireless performance i have not been dissatisfied
it was reasonably easy to set up though i did initially have problems with accessing the network
the range is reasonable
compared to my previous dlink and later on linksys access points experience the netgear experience has been pleasent
so my wireless experience and the ease of setup are the only reasons i gave the product  stars
the instability of the mr v is enough for me to warn any prospective buyer to keep away from this productive got version  of this product and i am using it very well in my living room into two bedroomsi also bought another from another seller then it didnt work i rmaed it then ive got a new one of version  yet i didnt test but i hope it is better new colorsimilar but new shapeive had this router for about  months now
its very easy to setup and maintain
it has a remote access feature that allows you to reconfigure the router remotelythe only drawback is that this router is not very tolerant of file sharing software
it frequently locks up despite severely limiting numbers of connectionsif you intend to use file sharing software get something else
otherwise this is a great routerthis was a good purchase for the money
i would recommend this to other buyers when i bought this router
now there are much faster routers that i would buythis device is not easy to install
the error your license does not permit use with this device is entirely misleading because the problem is actually that the microsoft generic drivers have been installed instead of the belkin set
the other symptom is that the bluetooth configuration control panel wont work
the following is for those familiar with the device managerif the drivers fail to install properly the instructions say to install through the driver update pathway by pointing to the bin folder in the belkin program folder
this will not work in xp
there are a number of threads on the internet but they boil down to  in device manager rightclick the belkin bluetooth adapter and select update driver  select install from a list or specific location advanced  next  select dont search i will choose the driver to install  next  there should be two options belkin bluetooth adapter and belkin bluetooth device
belkin bluetooth device is not digitally signed
select it and click nextthe software worked properly after this maneuver but it took hours to get therepthe belkin ft did what i wanted it to do whichwas move images from my phone to my pc without pulling the mmc card
it found my phone clear across the house
meter range means i can drop pictures on my pc from my garage if i wanted
the software bundle is very very short on documentation but big on function everything works as advertisedim withholding two stars for these reason though
 the aforementioned lack of value in the documentation and  the disappointment i have in not being able to browse my phone directly wouldve been nice to pull all my pictures from the phone rather than pushing each one to the pc
this is largely due to nokias pc suite not being configured correctly but also the byzantine manner in which you must configure bluetooth to make it worknote that this adapter has two versions v being the flag antenna version and v being the silver bullet version
drivers for v are not very current although   is available for registered usersin conclusion while v might be a solid choice i would recommend the linksys usbbt ltasin bdzet over this adapter for firsttimersfredthere are some issues with this belkin bluetooth adapter and wanted to warn potential buyers
i purchased this adapter a a local retailer despite warnings from other reviewers heremac os   works perfectly as every other bluetooth adapter ive triedwindows xp spa sp  works right after installing the widcomm bluetooth drivers
stops working after the first restart
continue to get invalid license key shutting down bluestackserveror something similarthe inconclusive problem is that while it works it detects other bluetooth devices fine on my hp work computer
however on my computer with asus pce motherboard it fails to detect a nokia ngage qd several feet away while a nokia  was detected
using the bluetooth drivers in windows xp sp fixes the problem detecting the ngage qd so it appears the problem surrounds the widcomm  drivers on the cdthe latest by the wayi picked this up for the same reason several other readers did i wanted to be able to move pictures sound and my phonebook from my phone to my laptop and back
i use a thinkpad x using windows xp for this taskuse the supplid drivers from the cd theyre much better than anything windows will attempt to do
and it will just work unlike what windows may createbrowsing with the supplied belkin software is clunky and ackward not nearly as fluid as it could be
its most definitely not as smooth as it is under mac os x but hey thats what you get
it works i get to move pictures around on my phone and my contact list without a cable
but its prone to fits of delays and ackwardnessim wishing there was better integration with windows xp right now xp sp supposedly has smoother bluetooth software and browsing
i wish the belkin sofware worked as nicely
as it stands this isnt the convenient device i hoped it would be but ill keep using iti had the same problem installing the software as some of you
invalid licenceetcetc
the thing is this bluetooth dongle works with my sp
in fact when i plug it in xp finds it installs its drivers and it works fine
i can connect it to my palm tungsten e and sync with no worries
however i wanted to see about surfing the net with it and from what i have read online one way to share an internet connection is with this belkinwidcomm softwarebottom line  it works but is not worth the trouble to me to waste time trying to share an internet connection
i use it to sync with my palm so i dont have to plug it in and nothing elsei have an sp and like it a lot
i couldnt find a  for my daughter so i bought her the sp
aparently the  has been discontinued
i thought that the higher model number and the higher price of the  meant it was a better player than my  bad assumptions
knowing what i know now i should have bought a refurbished  the  wont use standard aa batteries
the  has that option it comes with rechargables
unlike the  the  doesnt display as much information in the display and its not formatted in a way to make it easily understandable
the  doesnt have as many ways to configure its operation as the  does
the  has a great equalizer that is very flexible
the  has a rather crude equalizer that has no flexibility in the way it can be configuredi dont understand why sonic blue would discontinue their best cdmp player and replace it with something that costs more but doesnt work as well
the sp was a great product
ive seen used ones selling for 
im afraid to leave mine unattended on my deskits a nice keyboard
thin nice keys
but the volume and eject buttons dont work at all and you cant go online and get a new driver that will make them work
also the maker has no plans to make a new driver to fix this issue any time soon
i tried to return it but i really had to push to get the seller to pay for most of the shipping not all
they complained to me that amazon wouldnt reimburse them for shipping
they only agreed to pay for some of the shipping when i said it wasnt amazons fault they were selling a product that doesnt work as advertised
i ended up deciding i could live with the nonworking volume and eject buttons
it was less hassle that way than if id returned itbottom line  if you want a nice external keyboard with nonworking volume and eject buttons and you can live with having to reach across to your laptop keyboard any time you want to change the volume or eject a disk buy it
if not dontif i had this to do over again i would have spent more money and got a wireless keyboard or at least one where all the buttons workedthis keyboard makes typing more pleasant
pressing the keys causes a click sound thats not very loud
theres a slight pressure when i press down on a key which i find is helpful for typingthe color is off white
the power caps lock and number lock lights are in the upper right cornerthe computer instantly worked on my mac mini so i didnt have to install software
i prefer this to the apple keyboard kit for several reasons
its easier to type on this keyboard whereas on the apple keyboard my fingers would often accidentally move off the keys
the macalley board has a much stronger and longer cord which seems better because the apple cord i got started malfunctioning after a while so that i had to twist it a certain way for the keyboard to work
also i have to repeat type several keys on the apple machine in order for them to work
however the apple keyboard is much lighter is more resistant to being filled with lint etc due to smaller spaces between the keys and board and it has a light on the caps lock key so i instantly know if the caps lock is onedit this keyboard stopped working after about  year and  months so i decreased the rating to  starsoverall not too bad of a keyboard
it was okay
i have slightly larger hands so i wouldve preferred the keys spaced out abit more
it makes it easier to type a bit faster
my biggest complaint was the usb ports
i tried plugging in my ipod and my digital camera and neither one worked
it said it didnt have enough power
now i suppose if you want to use both ports for just a mouse or something it might be okay
it just seems rather unfortunate to have two usb ports builtin to the keyboard and have such limited use for them
it is however much better than the standard keyboard that comes with the imacjust make sure you test out the usb ports if you buy this to make sure it suits your needsive used this for a while now and i think it was a mistake to buy it
its a laptop style kb low profile and while its an improvement on the original awful apple keyboard its just not as comfortable as a classic full range inexpensive pc keyboard
im going to keep lookingthe kb requires a software driver to enable the sound and eject keys
this is unfortunate software drivers are hard to write and buggy drivers reduce system stability
theres no guarantee the drivers will work with  or that macally will update them
this may be true of all nonapple keyboards howeverworse the drivers are distributed using the obsolete sit format
the allume software that opens sit archives is no longer bundled with macs
the current owner has acquired a reputation for spam and very ill behaved software installation
i contacted macally about this but they did not seem very savvy
if youre stuck with sit i suggest downloading unarchiver rather than the stuffit product
if you do download allumes product to open the sit use a spam account
my yahoo spamonly account gets at least one allume spam a weekthe keyboard has two usb ports but they wont work with a modern thumb drive
im not sure theyre even usb  compliant but they work with a mouse
i wouldnt give these ports much weightbtw this review has  out of  persons who found it useful
its very typical for relatively negative amazon reviews to get lower ratings but this is a bit of out range
i wonder if an interested party is playing games
my recommendation for amazon reviews is to disregard the useful rating sort reviews from lowest to highest and read from the bottom upvolume doesnt work
shortcuts to dashboard are nonexistent
its bulky and they keys are pretty noisy
it works for the most part and does its job but next time i need a replacement keyboard i will just shell out the extra money for an apple producti bought this to replace the wireless keyboard that came with my imac in hopes that i would have easier access to usb ports on the side of the keyboard and would be able to load my bootcamp partition easier since it requires a usb keyboard to do the startup choicesevery part of my experience with this keyboard has been disappointing
it started with the shipping where it was being prepared for  days before actually being shipped
when i received it the drivers on the cd did not fully function for mac osx  the basic keyboard worked but the function keys and eject buttons did not
downloading the new driver from the website fixed that but that was not straightforward since the macally website no longer lists the icekey as a productthen there is the height of the keyboard
the front edge is  taller then that of an apple keyboard
if you use the foldout feet to put it at more of an angle which i have done with every other keyboard that i have had it becomes to tall and steep for me to comfortably use
using it without the rear feet takes some adjustment too since the keyboard is taller but flatter than what i consider a normal keyboardthis morning i tried plugging in a usb flashdrive in the usb port on the side on the keyboard
the port did not have enough power to run the flashdrive
i tested a few other devices and a few other flash drives did work but other flash drives and usb powered devices that i have used via the side usb ports on an actual apple keyboard did not work with the macallyif i had to do this again i would not buy this keyboardthis keyboard is better than the stock apple imac keyboard for rapid typing as it has a shorter key stroke
still it isnt as good as most laptop keyboards
some of the key switches squeak when you press them and one key arrived somewhat twisted out of position i think because one of the scissors links is tweaked
the touch is a bit heavier than it needs to be and writing a great deal does make fingers and wrists sore
when going fast i find that the shift keys dont engage
overall im disappointed for the money the quality ought to be better with a lighter smoother and more consistent touch
follow up note this was hurting my hands and i replaced it with a kensington slim type keyboard mac version and a belkin usb hub
the kensington is much better  crisp clean touch that doesnt have the slight sponginess of the macally
i recommend you buy the kensingtoni went to circuit city yesterday to purchase some new speakers
i listened to these among others
in my opinion the quality is good for the price
they are just not that clear
the midrange sounds kind of muffled
the bass sounds good though
spend a few dollars more and get some creative labs inspire speakers they sound much betteri like this cooling device and id have given it a fivestar rating if it werent for the fact that it has a lifespan of only about six months
ive purchased several of these over time i lose count either four or five and have had the same results every time
when it works it does a great job of keeping my laptop cool
after about six months i find the units begin to fail
fail meaning they simply stop working period
i have not had one yet that has lasted beyond six months
ive tried one other brand and did not care for it in terms of efficiency or design so im sticking with the targus till i see something else come along that seems truly better
positives for the targus aside from effeciency include being lightweight with nice rounded design and no rough edges and a small footprint that fits nicely in a carrying bag
im realizing now that ill have to resign myself to budgeting two of these per year into my finances
its a shame they do not last longer  they really are effective while they lastefficiency  lifespan  grand total in the beginning the fans were very powerful and effective
also the concave shape allowed for great air flowif it simply had a power cord instead of a faulty plug for the power cord i would still be a happy customer today instead of wiggling the cord to get it to worki did buy a worse fan pad though and i have revised my review for that onethe cooling pad i received is not the same as the one shown
i had ordered this as a replacement to fit into a matching targus laptop stand and thus needed the one with the curved sides as shown in the image
nonetheless i tried out this version of this fan which is thinner and much quieter but turned out to be not nearly as effective at cooling as the one with the curved sides shown in the imagei followed the amazon procedure for notifying them that the image doesnt match the product but if you are still seeing the image of the silvergrey fan with the curved sides you can see how effective that wasi think theres an error with amazon confusing reviews of the targus chill padmat with the coolpad
therefore this review is specifically for the chill pad aka chill mative had the chill pad for a week now and it performs exactly as described
it has definitely reduced the heat that my powerbook g releases by at least f estimation
usually i would just put my laptop on top of my pillow and then put them both over my lap because the heat is too unbearable for my legs
i know that is dangerous but i didnt have a chill pad until a week ago
please dont do this at home eitherthe chill pad comes in an aluminum colored textured plastic
in other words the pad is not smooth
the fans are placed on the top of the cooler in the middle so it doesnt really get in the way of my powerbook gs fans which are on the sides
theres an onoff switch attached to the usbpower adapter cord
the cord is short so there isnt an extra long and annoying cord that youd have to carry around
the pad isnt too thick either
it is as thick as my laptop  about an inch in heightpersonally i would like the targus chill pad much better if there were a sign on the package that said this chill pad is only suitable for  notebooks otherwise it is too small for  notebooks esp
with widescreen
in addition theres this warning smallprint that says this product contains chemicals including lead known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm
wash hands after handling
okay so knowing that most laptop owners are usually on the go why would you make a cooling chill pad that had dangerous chemicals including lead in it
even though this chill pad has amazing potentials there are plenty of noncarcinogenic notebook coolers out there that can perform just as well with a longer width
as a result im returning my chill pad todayi purchased this cooling device for my bighonkin hp pavilion  laptop because there were times when my laptop was literally too hot to touch
im not sure if the device has actually helped extend the life of my pc but i feel much better about letting it run constantly
in any case i think a cooling pad is an excellent investment especially if you have a laptop that doesnt cool itself particularly wellhowever i have to give the targus chill pad a c because ive only had it  months now and it seems like its ready to break
for the most part it just sits on my desk under my laptop
i dont move it terribly often except when i travel once a month
as i write this review the chill pads cooling fans are making a pretty healthy racket
mind you it wasnt always like this  when the pad was new it was almost silent
but as time has gone by the fans have gotten progressively louder
now im concerned the cooling fans will soon fail because the left one will occasionally sound like my blender
a quick tap on the top of the fan seems to fix it but its happening more and more oftenfor  its hard to expect something that will last forever
however i think the lifetime should be longer than  or  months
good idea poor executioni expected better from targus
doesnt really cool the laptop that welli liked this for the price
i had the previous version of this which lasted a few years while constantly running
this version comes with a cheaply made wire which has already broken
i have to prop a book on it to keep it lined up just right so that the fans spin
i will not buy another one unless they use the old better wirethis cooler is too small for any regular sized notebook
its also very flimsy the one i have broke withen a few months
not worth the moneyi liked the chillmat but it doesnt blow air onto the bottom of the laptop but it sucks air and blows it out the back of the chillmat and i guess for some computers its okay
mine wasnt much cooler to the touch than wout it
i guess since mine tends to get hot on the lower left where my palm rests it wasnt as nice as i would have wanted for the money
i ended up buying another cooler from vantec lapcool which actually blows air onto the bottom instead of drawing air
it did a better job
i still have the targus chill pad but wont use it unless the vantec breaks down
so in my opinion for my amd turion  laptop id prefer the vantec over the targusi bought this notebook cooling pad as a birthday present for my husband about  years ago
despite us not using it too often at its peak use we only used it about  times per week it completely died this morning
about a year ago it began making noises as if the fans were having issues getting going
i have kept the cool pad almost entirely dust free and in good condition but it just seems the little fans that could spun for the last time this morningit does keep your laptop cool and for  which is the price amazon lists it at the time of the review it cant be beat for how well it works
however dont expect it to last more than  yearsi have purchased two targus chill mats and while i can say they both work well when they do work both of my chill mats have ceased to function
while the cooling tray does cool my laptop and it cools it very effectively the power switch on the targus chill mat is very cheaply made and the wires have been pulled out of both units i purchased
i was able to splice the cords together and got another three months use out of the one tray from it but for the full retail price of this tray i expected morealso the little rubber lift on the back of the tray have a tendency to fall off
they are loose on one unit having fallen off and been pushed back in several times and the other unit that travels with me they are just missinglostalso the little stoppers on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to help keep the tray from slipping have all but one fallen off tooanother negative if you have a wide screen laptopnotebook the targus chill mat is not wide enough to provide good stability for the laptop
the smaller laptops are fine but mine is a  widescreen and so it doesnt fit properlyso summary is it works great while its working but its cheaply made and for the price you could probably find a sturdier unitgood product doing good job for good pricetill  the switch fall a part and then just keep twisting the wiresto keep the fans thing runninglittle detail to screw good productespecially when you forgot that the fans are not runningbecause the wires are disconnect and your notebook dyed on you somewhere in middle of your workits okget what you pay for
they become noisy every couple of years but fit my notebook stand perfectly
bought twofor some reason i miscalculated size of this pad
it is shorter that my notebook
i think spec should state clearly what is supported size of laptop
anyway it is working and when fans is blowing air it actually cool down laptop
unfortunately quality of fans is low
at start up fans makes a lot of noise and it takes few min to go noise away
i am expecting fan to get stuck very soonthis targus pau notebook chill pad worked well providing adequate cooling airflow for my laptop for about a year after which the power cord receptacle on the unit developed a fault probably a solder joint broke inside from the pressure of inserting the power plug
after that the operation became intermittent and shortly afterwards it crapped out completely
i took the unit apart and found it fairly well constructed considering the plastic components but could not repair the faulty receptacle
as theres no easy way to recycle the two  vdc small fans the unit becomes trash
its a shame because but for this design flaw its a very effective unit for well i purchased this item for my gateway gz laptop cuz i noticed it was running a little sluggish and a friend told me try getting a cooling pad and see if it runs the computer a little cool and give it more speed
so i tried it and i cant really tell if its working or not
i installed new memory chips and now got gb
so i dont know if its the memory chips making it run faster or the fact that theres a cooling pad
i still feel hot air blowing outta the side of my laptop
p on winter months i use it as a hand warmer thats how warm the air is
kinda like a laptop with a mini heater on the side
but it seems to be working find via usb port and not too loud of a sound
i cant say id recommend it cuz i dont know if its even making a difference but at the price youre paying for it
all i can say is just trial and error 
buy it and you see for yourself if its junk or treasurei have the one pictured but i got it at walmart for 
so those worried about it breaking take note of that
i like this cooler because the way they have the fan exhaust coming out of the slit on the back
opposed to underneath the pad so as long as you keep the back clear your good
the one thing i dont like is that it sucks doesnt blow hot air
so my laptop and the pad are fighting each other for air though i think the pad is winning
i went into the pad to see if i could switch the fans around but there doesnt look to be an easy way
i suppose this could be the reason it breaks due to the constant struggle for air
if it werent for the fans id given this a  stari bought this product  year ago
it works great for  month after that the fans stop working
the solution was simple cut off the switch its not necessary if you plug it into a ubs port its bucause you need to fan you computerafter this simple operation its working again
i think it worth the money that you paythis device has great sound especially with decent headphones but is a case study in falsity in advertising since the only other way to explain the companys claim that the battery lasts up to  hours is to assume that they rounded up to the nearest multiple of  also note that theres no window and songs added without reformatting will as an inviolable rule never end up where you want them
but it is really small just make sure you pack a few extra batterieswhen this device worked it was great
small could go running with it and i remember excellent audio clarity
but every once in a while it wouldnt work
and i could never figure out why
 of the time worked great
 of time it really pissed me off
a year later it seems to have completely stopped working
would probably have given a  if the player was more solid and tech difficultiesbugs had been worked outi saw over  consumer reviews  praising this product and an equal number saying that it is hopelessly buggy or simply does not worki am a moderately experienced pc user who bought and installed studio deluxe version  in june  this product is beautifully designed and rich in features for a consumer video product
i found a number of blatant and frustrating bugs but in the end was able to create a beautiful  minute videohere is what i recommend  go to the pinnaclesyscom site and spend at least  minutes going through their forum postings
notice that the forum is nicely designed and very active
notice that there are hundreds of very frustrated users who have spent weeks or even months getting pinnacle to work the way its supposed to
notice that many of the threads have almost no helpful info from pinnacle staff and are sprinkled with comments like hello pinnacle anybody home
or sad accounts of trying to get phone support
users list the things theyve tried and eventually somebody comes up with a solution or workaround
do not buy this product unless you are willing to troubleshoot your problems with other users on the pinnacle forum and try  things before finding the thing that solves your problem
if you make the plunge buy it from a local retailer with a  day return policy or better and get right to work
install this on a late model computer running xp
follow all their install recommendations and those on the forum to the letter including adding a nd hard drive
my pc was a  dell  but it was very uptodate and it was adequate
if you are working to a deadline leave lots of time for problem solving and refining your work
no matter what software you use you will spend a crazy amount of time polishing your video
complete a small project before starting a large project
you may lose your work and have to start over or find that you are unable to output your work to dvd
there are bugs in this software but keep your cool and dont blame everything on pinnacle
in my case  of the problems were operator error and  of the problems were due to a bad dvd burner
if you can wait  months
the whole video editing dvd burner situation may be ready for prime time by theni bought this software over a year ago to edit video from my sony digital  camerainstallationit took me close to  months to setup because of issues between windows me and the included firewire card
i actually had to hack the microsoft drivers inf file to get the card to work properly on my systemuser interfacethe software is amazing easy to use
the user interface is very intuitiveto capture hookup your digital camcorder to the firewire card with the included cable
you just say you want to record and up to  minutes of video is transfered at a time
this is due to a limit in the size of avi filesthe system is capable of automatically sensing scene breaks so when it captures it automatically organizes scenesfor editing it just have to arrange the scenes
you can also shorten the scenes through again a very good uithe software has  voice tracks
you can easily add music from mps or cds to your video
you can also do voiceovers  i havent tried this yet if you are making dvds you can add chapters and menus
the ui for doing this is pretty good as wellyou can also add stills
ive made many videos which are combination of video and stills pictues from a digital camerathe software comes with many transitions
you can do fads and other cool effectsyou can output your movie to dvd svcd vcd realnetworks microsoft media player format or mpeg  no quicktime support now the bad the software has been very unreliable at times i lost hours of work
anyone who looks at the message boards will see that the user base of this software is generally unhappy
i seem to finally have a patch that has made the software reasonable reliable
i can honestly say that i love the software but have never been so frustrated with the qauality of a piece of software before
when it works its really good but it doesnt always workbecause of the unreliability of the software i would not recommend it to a computer novicei am an avid gamer and i owned the white microsoft intellimouse optical and it worked great with games and had a great feel but it was white and i converted my system to all black
so i decided to look for a new mouse
well after reading the reviews on the mx and it was black and grey i decided to go with it
it works great precesion wise but i have a few gripes
the back and forward buttons are both placed on the left side of the mouse which are hard to get at where as when i used the microsoft intellimouse optical with each button on each side i would fine i would occasional use them as they are right there
as a gamer i use the scroll where to cycle thru weapons and i always set the scroll wheel click push down on it as my jump button
this seems natural to me and im sure other people use it as this funtion as well
well compared to the microsoft intellimouse optical pushing down on the wheel takes some force and ive found during gaming i more often then not due to the amount of force needed to click the wheel i end up scrolling it up or down at the same time and my weapons end up changing on me
with the microsoft intellimouse optical it had the easiest push down on scroll and i never made a mistake with it
so probable because of this problem i will be purchasing the microsoft intellimouse optical again
i use a fellows mouse pad with gell wrist pad
never have any problems with it but now with this mouse i get some friction which sometimes created a griping sound which is anoying where as my old microsoft intellimouse optical flowed friction freebut dont get me wrong without this few problems would be a decent mouse
but for a gamer i highly recommend the microsoft intellimouse optical not the explorer version as it is similar to this mouse with button layoutsave a few bucks and go with the microsoft intellimouse opticalim sure you mustve heard the hype about how precise this mouse and its all true
however this mouse isnt perfect from a gaming perspective
the weight for one is way too heavy and can cause wrist strain after extended use with click fest games such as diablo and online fps
i didnt notice it at first but after a few hours of intense gaming my wrist started hurting so bad i literally saw stars
this happened on a consistent basis despite me having an ergonomically perfect chair and desk combo
im very dissapointed with logitech because ive never experienced wrist strains with my old ms explorer  mouse even after more than  hours of useoverall if you can handle pushing this absurdly heavy mouse around all day then go for it
if notthen stay away for your own goodi know that this mouse is kinda old and outdated but its hard to find a good wired mouse these days
i read all about logitech and the mx series mice and had a good feeling going into thisphysical stuffi got the mouse and was very excited
it has a somewhat unusual feel to the mouse itself
you can feel the mouse very slightly stick to your hand when you touch it
the finish isnt extremely smooth
but other than that it fits good in the hand
the button placement isnt bad considering how many buttons you have
the wheel button presses fairly hard almost too hard and the wheel scrolls with a cheap feel
i wont expect this one to last all that long
overall i was fairly pleased with the mouse until i tried 
softwarethe logitech mouseware software is terrible
they claim that it allows for button customization which it does but for  program
there is no program specific customization
if you run cad applications or firefox or any program that deviates from windows defaults you are basically sol
ive done reading and logitech has an advanced settings program which is more of a joke than mouseware
it basically gives you  check marks which do no good
there are rd party software that i think will do the job like logigame but thats another ram hogging program to runoverallif you want to do real computing programming cad graphic editing look at other mice
i cant say for games because i dont play computer games
i came from a microsoft intellimouse explorer  and would go back in a heartbeat if i could
i was suckered in by logitechs reputation here dont do the samenearly perfect
if it werent for the fact that the logitech software takes over my synaptics touchpad software on my laptop it would be perfect
with the logitech software installed my touchpad was useless
too bad because it worked fairly well except the scroll bar was not super accuratebeing really sensitive to the ugliness of any kind of computer cables i bought the mx wireless mouse from logitech mostly based on its cordless design and its many buttonsas much as i really wanted to like this mouse i really do hate cables i ended up being frustrated once too many with the iffyness of the wireless signal connection
i simply could not find any practical spot on my desk that wasnt far enough from any em influence
moreover if the base was more than  or  away from the mouse the connection became erratic
when it worked it was beautiful
when it didnt i wanted to throw it out the windowin the end i decided to send it back and ordered reluctantly its corded brethen the mx
boy what a difference a simple cord make
i have been using this mouse for about  weeks now and i still get impressed and elated by the feeling of extreme precision and confident authority this mouse gives me whenever i use it
indeed i have even grown to love its cable
this is how good this mouse iseverything i liked about the mx is in the mx without the frustration
the buttons are where i expect to find them with just the right amount of resistance to them
the mouse feels just right in the palm of my hand
its weight is an improvement over the slightly too heavy mx
its mouse software is simple effective and extremely flexible
the optical design virtually never needs cleaningthe only negative i might point to and a very subjective one at that is that the mx silver accent was a perfect match for my dual g
the mx silver is more smokey grey than silver yes we mac users really are that picky with the esthetics of our tools  all in all i cannot recommend this mouse the mx not the mx enough
it is quite simply the very best mouse i have ever used and certainly the only mouse i have ever felt that passionate aboutlike some other people im only getting around to a review after about  years of steady usethis has been my work mouse and it has seen a very steady stream of use over the last several years
i used it so much ive worn the feet off it and the contacts have been scraped down to the point it wont charge anymore
actually ive had charging problems with the mouse for the last few years
ive always been able to clean the contacts or jiggle the mouse etc and get to to charge againthe mouse itself still works fine but it wont charge even new rechargeable batteries anymore
im not complaining too much because i certainly got good service from this mouse
but the whole recharging feature was kinda messed up from the start and that is what finally killed it
i dont even think they sell this mouse new anymore but given the problems i had with recharging i would not recommend buying it usedi bought this after reading a highlycomplimentary review extremetechcom
i dont think switching from my old corded mouse was really worth the effort and in fact i might go back to it
although i do like the elimination of cord drag here are the things i dont like as another reviewer mentioned you do have to remember to charge the mouse regularly although ive searched the documentation and havent found out exactly how long a charge should last
i had to make a run back to the office this weekend when i realized i had left the mouse on my desk and i couldnt afford the hour downtime monday morning waiting for the mouse to charge the small printed setup guide whose content appears to be used for several different products tells you that the charger must be placed  inches from any electrical device
try to find a spot on your desk  inches away from any other electrical device the mouse is fairly heavy which means you cannot place it on an inclined surface such as a keyboard tray because it will slide down
but the weight does not make it difficult to use other than that
 sometimes an activity especially scrolling appears to quotstickquot ie the page continues to scroll after youve stopped telling it to
this usually happens to me in browser windows as opposed to desktop applications the software for configuring the mouse doesnt seem to work well
for example ive tried several times to configure the universal scroll properties
the options i select never seem to stick but theres no indication that my options failed or the reason for the failureso id have to say im not all that pleased with this mouse
i havent gone back to my old corded one yet but if the recharging thing gets to be too much trouble i probably will
the benefits of the this cordless mouse just dont outweigh the annoyancesthe router itself is very good but it also runs at a high temperature and is extremely hot to the touch and the rebate well you wont get it because i tried but the company said that i didnt buy it within the rebate promotional period i sent them a copy of the receipt and rebate form again but i still was denied the money i guess the rebate people are illiteratebeing from the video game generation it seemed like a great idea
i must admit it is very easy to use if you are used to using a pc joystick
if you only want to use a small point and shoot or very small slr without flash battery grip or lenses over mm this is an acceptable solutioni now only use this head for holding my flash unit
the problem is that as a general rule your head should support about  times the weight of your system which only allows for about  lbs and i have lenses that weigh more than that
if you have flash units andor heavy lenses that you will be using you will notice this head creep as gravity pulls on ita better alternative is the mgrc head which is very smooth and easy to use with the added benefit of being rated for about  lbs
instead of   of course it comes at a price but for something you will be using regularly it is nice to have something you are comfortable with and trusti have this for about  years now
it has been great for group shots
only recently that i use it for macrophotography with d and mm vr nikon macro lens
unfortunately the weight is too much for the ball head to hold the camera when it is pointed at an angle no matter how tightly it is seti strongly agree with the other reviewers that boses speakers are way over price
they are living off the hype of their success of the wave radio and their early surround sound system that were great theater quality
that is the only reason they have to justify over pricing their other not too hot products
i got these speakers years ago and the price were still the sameperformancequalitythese speakers are very clear and you get a good range of sound
high pitch sound can be heard but there are no bass sound what so ever
if you have a receiver a subwoofer is necessary or these speakers are too boring to listen to
i would say the sound is dryflat not very special but again are very clear
these speakers are loudspeaker i noticed they renamed them multipurpose meaning they belong in a church mall or other civic spaces that doesnt need bass but have some clarity
the surround sound effect is a gimmick they sound like any other above average quality speakers
they are bigger size then normal satellite speakers
they do have hanging bracket that can be screw to the wall
are not weather proofpricewhy did i pay for overpriced speakers
i got gift certificate and needed to finish my rear satellites of my surround system
at good guys nothing was cheap and i heard of bose before and the salesman said they were great full of nonsense
at base price of  they are price at a low to average price tower speakers that will give you more bass
for being a supporting cast as the rear satellite i think they should be priced under a hundred dollar
for multipurpose or civic loudspeaker price should be no more then a hundredtwenty dollar for these guys
if you can find them on sale for under hundred they would be a great pick up but otherwise past on these and polk audio klipsch are better priceperformancethis is a nice lens relatively small with decent resolving power better at close distancesand a greatimo focal length for an  cropwhat i didnt like was that it is relatively slow for a fixed focal lenth at  it does not have full time manual focus my   seemed to resolve this is a subjective conglomerate of resolution and contrast better at infinity focus
as far as small primes go this is one of the few to chose from in this range i like pentaxs selection better it is a good performernote i find the mm usm edge sharpness similari have the canon  prime lens which i like very much but on my canon xti its not quite wide enough
so i purchased this lens and also a sigma f ex macro to take on vacation thinking the sigma would be used for more flexibility and the mm for a very light walkaround lensin my tests though my  wasnt nearly as sharp as my 
it might have just been my copy of the lens i dont know
but the sigma was as sharp as the mm
so i returned the mm and will keep the sigma
with a prime you lose the zoom so it better be both a sharper and b brighter wider aperture
since it was the same sharpness as the sigma and no brighter back it goes
i was thinking id sell my  but now ill keep it as its both very sharp and has an f apertureagain it could have have been the copy i got but since my sigma fits my needs i wont try againi know whitebox version is identical to retail version but for a msrp of  i would expect a retail version from amazonmy review of this lens compare to my  ii and mmpros better build quality great zoom rangecons not silent as expected noticeable is noisy slower focus in low light not expected from this usm not seeing better image qualityi purchased this when i was interested in getting the mm or the mm and i should have spent the extra money
the quality is decent but i am not too impressedi bought this lens about a year ago and i was surely disappointed with its performance
images are not sharp at all or at least not as expected
it is an ok lens for snapshotsafter  weeks  of which in the caribbean i returned this lens to canon in nj for repair and realignmentpictures are too blurry and autofocus seems to be fast but inaccurate forward focus very noticeableshould be back within a week from now so ill update my review then
thank goodness i had my mm l with mei think this may be the last nonl lens i buybogus exceptionthis lens has a very useful focal range is fairly compact has a decent minimum focus distance and has image stabilization
everything you would want in a good walkaround lens basically
unfortunately it just didnt sing for me
i wanted it to be better than it is i guess its because im spoiled by owning some l glass and great thirdparty lenses like thetamron sp mm di vc usd canon mount afaci do a lot of product photography and in the small space that is my home studio im constantly running up against the minimum focus distance on the canon mm lenses
the tamron mm works well enough but sometimes m isnt quite long enough to get the perspective that im after
i can switch to prime lenses such as the canon mm macro however i thought that this lens would be a good allaround compromise since it covers more focal range on the long end and focuses pretty close
not quite close enough im afraid
it has a little section at the end labeled macro but thats a joke
the closest focusing distance is approximately  inches cm and the max
magnification is a mere x
my tamron mm on the other hand focuses as close as  inches cm and has a max
magnification ratio of x even though it is not labeled macro
the canon mm didnt gain me any ground in the area of close focus while giving up a considerable amount of image qualityspeaking of image quality it is only moderately good and when youre used to shooting with high quality glass its a disappointment
the image stabilization is an earlier generation and so its not as effective as todays is
i just couldnt see myself accepting the drop in quality to gain the additional focal range
you can see that this lens doesnt really hold its value as the resale price for used is considerably less than the price for new
its currently selling used for only about  of the new cost
compare this to most l lenses which hold their resale value much better usually demanding  or more of the new price
on the upside you can easily pick one of these up for around  here or on the bay and try it out if you like with minimal riskreleased in  this is now showing its age
this or something like it would be a great candidate for a canon remake
i hope they consider it because there are not any other full frame lenses to choose from that cover this particular range
there is an efs lens with a very similar field of view range thecanon efs mm f is usm ud wide angle zoom lens for canon digital slr cameraswhich is an exceptionally good lens
if youre shooting on a crop body definitely skip this lens and get that one
if youre shooting full frame save up for the tamron mm or the canon mm fhappy shootingi originally reviewed this as a consumer who had no idea about photography
now i have some knowledge and have upgraded to the   and this lens now sits as a in case my lens dies emergencyoverall for a beginner on a budget this is a good lens
way better then any kit lens
the zoom ring is loose and slides around very easily when you do not want it to
if you want a narrow depth of field when only a small amount of the image is in focus and you are on a budget get the   lens instead
but if you are looking for a good quality walk around lens this is great for a beginner or casual photogpros good quality lens for pricecons does not open up enough loose zoom ringthis lens is good but not great
i always compare it to a swiss army knife it does a lot of things but none of them as well as a more specialized tool wouldkeep in mind that this is a consumergrade zoom lens  its not going to deliver the results that a prime lens or an lseries zoom will
compared to kit lenses and lowend consumer grade zooms however this lens shinesits a good lens generalpurpose lens for casual photography or when you only want to carry one lens but its not really sharp enough or fast enough for the serious amateur or professional who needs to make large prints
it has close focus capabilities but cant compare to a real macro lens
its not very fast
it covers a useful range although its not quite wide enough for shooting indoors with a cropped sensor
while the image stabilization works well its a firstgeneration system thats not as good as the is on more recent lens designs especially while panningits an older lens that was designed for film and it shows
while even a lowend dslr will outresolve this lens film hits its sweet spot
ive found it to be very soft at focal lengths mm and below it gets sharper at longer lengths and is good enough for most purposes in the  range
at mm on a d i can get good but not great x prints larger print sizes make this lenss weaknesses very prominentall in all its probably not the best choice for the apsc dslr owner but a great one for a film shooter
within the same price range the efs  is is probably a better choice for the digital shooter who wants an allinone lens
professionals or serious amateurs in need of a general purpose zoom should strongly consider stepping up to either the considerably more expensive efs  f is or ef  flive had this now for about   years now
its my most used lens
there are so many pros and cons with this particular item and ill just share a bitprospricegood upgrade from the stock mmrange flexibilityconszooming in or out tends to feel sticky at times not like a smooth transition as youd like it to beattaching a lens hood to the end of this will of course add weight and will therefore extend your lens all the way out while youre onthego
i always have to retract mine whenever i notice that someones bumped into me or i bump into some random object
feels like an inconveniencenot so much a premium buildfeel
but hey you get for what you pay for right
kinda makes me wonder why this is the standard lens for the canon dall in all its just an ok lens
nothing special
i use this on a canon ti and no im obviously not a professional photographer but i can tell the subtle differences in objects
anyways i would recommend this to any average amateur photographeri have been using this lens for the past  yearsconsidering the price is a great lensbut it sucks dust i thought i am the only one to get this but found out that almost everyone got infected with the dustthis can make it a useless buy after a very short periodit is a great lens but expect some slight play in the twopart extension of the barrel expect focus and zoom rings that are not silkysmooth at first i though it was broken but then ive found out that it is typical from this lens the manual focus ring is smallnarrow and requires familiarity to quickly find it while shooting no focal length lock is present  expect zoomcreepgravityzooming when carrying this lens in a downward positiongood price for the quality of picture im happyone thing that i learned over the last  years of photography lensesand cameras can differ from sample to sample andlong range zooms especially sigmas are the worst offenders
i first bought this efmm for use on my original dlast summerit turned out to be the rd most optically defective lens that ever owned next to my old sigma  and mmthe right side of the lens never got sharp yet the center and left were fine
i sold it
last week i saw a mm for sale at hunts photo so i tried it out it was better
i brought my d down today to try it out and i noticed the edges were very low resolutionthis one was made in taiwan
i explained to the salesperson my story with this lens and she took one off of a used d kit to try out
this one wassharp to the edges even wide open and made in japan
it was spot clean and had a red mark on the mount so i think it was serviced and adjusted by canon it was even cheaper than the original one i looked at
now i am happy this is the sharpest wide zoom that i own but unless yours was adjusted by canonwho knowspurchased june  a little disappointed so farthe lens creep is more like a lens dropthe outside shots are very good for the most part how much is me or the lens
i have some beautiful shots of weddings and outdoor events on bright days but hit and miss indoorsautofocus not quick indoors and i had expected more from the is featurein a brightly lit gymnasium the shots were very dull and lifeless and i was unable to get anything good with movement of the subject
wish i had had my  mm canon for that eventi will probably sell and look for something elseits an okay lens for a travel lens in that price range
the range pretty much covers everything i need to do on trips but i now prefer to just take my efs kit lenses with me  and 
the  is quite soft has a bit of zoom creep and has some difficult focusing in low light or indoors just focus manually then
it still takes nice pictures and i usually stop it at f if i really want it to be sharper
i prefer to do as little postprocessing as possible and i find the two kit lenses produce better and sharper results for me for around the same price
bear in mind the build of the kit lenses isnt quite as solid and heavy as the  but i dont mind less weight on the camerai bought this lens to serve as one lens fits all needs
it definitely served the purpose
however this lens has inherent flaws  poor motor that makes the lens not to focus quickly lack of sharpness in the image and the sound during focus etc
i was suffering to get a good sharp picture with this one
i will definitely discourage getting this lens as there are better ones out there  even from canon
although i read several discouraging reviews before i bought this price was the attractive feature at that pointsadly at the end my digital slr camera with this lens was stolen by chennai airport baggage handlers in india during my last tripi am planning to get a new camera and a lens  definitely not this lensthis lens came with my d and is probably one of the better kit lenses
it features is which is very useful for low light situations
one of the things i dont like about this lens is the fact that it doesnt have a fixed aperture
the aperture increases as you zoom out which is a real bummer
another weakness is the image quality
images are not very sharp in my opinion and saturationcontrast is soso
if your looking for a starter lens then this is a lens you might consider
its light and pretty reasonably priced for a lens having isthis lens has been my workhorse for the past two years
i have dragged this lens through the rain forests of the amazon backpacked with it in europe and hiked with it in new zealand
the lens locks into focus very quickly and the image stabilization works quite well
when i first got the lens i played with turning off the is and then taking the same photo with the is and i found that with the is i could get the same quality photo at a slower shutter speed if need behowever that all being said this lens does suffer from some problems
a friend of mine and my sister also have this lens and two of our lenses arrived out of the box feeling quite loose
while holding the camera body with one hand and the end of the lens with the other you could move the end of the lens about an alarming amount
i am not sure if other owners have this same problem or if it is just normal
or maybe the looseness has just gotten worse over the past two years due to usethe biggest problem with this lens is dust in the lens
google this lens dust and see how many people out there are complaining that this lens sucks dust into the body due to the extending piston design
if i hold this lens upside down after it spends some time in my camera bag i can see dust all over the inside of the lens
i am not taking photos with a lens that i know produces spots and may be pumping the dust into my slr body
after only two years i am now forced with the choice of returning the lens to canon to be cleaned or writing off the lens
canon can not tell me how much the cleaning will cost until i send it to them
however i will have to pay  for their time making the estimate if i decide that the repairs are too costlydespite the problems unless you have the money for an l lens get this lens because it is fantastic
based on my budget at the time i would not hesitate to get this lens again despite the problems
but if you want a lens that will last longer and is much better spend the extra money on an li used this lens on the d
first of all on a crop camera the widest the lens goes mm is not wide at all
usually for a general purpose lens you want the lens have a wide side but this lens doesnt
if you have a full frame camera i would not recommend this camera at all
although the focal range is very convenient it is not very sharp and the  varying aperture just wont cut it
if you spend all that money on a full frame camera you need to get nice glass
for anyone using film this would be a great lens
if you need a cheap general purpose lens for a film camera this is your lens
one of the things i liked about this lens was the build quality
the build quality is pretty good
it is made of a strong feeling plastic
i liked how the zoom and focus ring felt
i did get some lens creep and when the lens was fully extended it felt a little loose
if you have a crop camera and are looking for an upgrade from the kit lens you wont be happy with this
its built like a nicer lens but your images wont be nicer
i recommend the tamron mm  it has a  aperture is tack sharp wide open has a lens hood included and is much wider
you really dont need the extra reach to mm
the lack of good image quality makes this lens no good for all cameras especially full frame and the lack of a wide focal length makes it no good for a crop camera
however if you are using a film camera you might want to consider this lens
i sold this lens for the tamron mm  and could not be happier
also with the  lens image stabilization will not be required and you will have beautiful out of focus backgroundsi have been using this lens for five years and have probably taken over  photographs with it film and fullframe digital with sky filters colored filters for black  white film and polarizing filters as appropriate
as time has passed i find that i use it less and less because i can almost always get better results with something elsei have often found a kind of harsh contrast to the photographs i take with this lens
when using it i have to be particularly diligent about lighting as a result
zoom is convenient for composing but the camera is not optimal for controlling distracting backgrounds this lens is certainly not appropriate for portraitsonly once did i get pictures with this lens that were much better than i expected when handheld photos at maximum zoom on slow film in a dark temple came out perfectly
thats entirely a credit to the image stabilizernowadays i regard this as a snapshot lens as such its often superseded by a pointandshoot camera which takes pictures almost as well and is a lot easier to carry aroundfirst i should point out im an amatuer
this is my first lens for my canon rebel xti
i purchased this lens on amazon over a year ago and although i have no other lens to compare this to  i am dissapointed
heres why i read a few reviews indicating that this lens could be your only lens  good for all purpose
i have to disagree
i am often frustrated by the limited mm range
especially for landscape shots
now if i knew how to crop photoshop etc perhaps this wouldnt be as big an issue for me
in retrospect i wish i had purchased a telephoto lens with mm range and purchased the basic lens that came with the xti for shortrange photos i was warned that the lens was heavy but i thought hey  im  pretty strong  no big deal
however now i wish i had gone with a lighter lens
the lens is heavy and makes carrying around your camera all day a little less appealing
for a casual photographer who wants good shots i have to imagine there is a decent quality lighter lens out there for less money however i admit i have no idea yet if thats true
 i find that about  of my shots are a bit blurry
i attribute this to being an amatuer but i never had this problem with less sophisticated pointandshoot cameras
is it possible im doing something wrong
probably
but again im writing this as an amatuer so if youre like me perhaps theres a better lens out there or maybe not  ill have to try another one and find out
in summary although i have no major complaints with this lens i was dissapointed after reading all the glowing reviews
i am now considering purchasing the canon ef mm f is usm lens or the mm fl is usm autofocus lens
i plan on trying them both out at a local camera store before purchasing  especially since i want to make sure i get enough zoom in my next lensgood luck with your purchasewere all looking for a good allpurpose lens something that is wide enough for group shots but has enough zoom range to remove the frequent requirement to change lenses
the usm with full time manual focus was something that attracted me to it as well
having something that would focus fast and quietly compared to the grinding of the  kit lens  were talking prestm days here would have been a great thingin the end it never worked for me  while it was ok at the long end in terms of focal range it wasnt wide enough on a crop at the short end
the usm focus was great but the lens itself was average with too much chromatic aberration and corner softnessthe image stabilizer was also hard to get used to and missed a few good tripod shots because i forgot to turn it off it will not detect a tripod and try to compensate for the motion that isnt there
not sure why canon ever thought this would be a good kit lens on the d  it was such a waste of a good camera on a mediocre lens
maybe it was ok in the film days yes thats when it was designed but its not capable of keeping up with modern digital sensorswhen canon introduced the  stm lens that was the obvious candidate to replace it
it is the one lens solution to have on a crop camera
on a full frame im still not convinced it would be a good lens on the modenr high density sensors but i never tried it myselfi was a bit sad to let it go  the build quality was great the lens had a solid feel which you dont get with the modern plastic lenses even if they have a metal mount it still attaches to plastic and it looked great
i miss the distance window something that the  doesnt havei might buy another one if i can find a cheap nonfunctional copy and keep it as an ornament  its a good looking lensi got this lens as the kit lens with my d
for the first month or so i was pretty disappointed with the quality of images from it
specifically indoor available light shots were not impressive
outdoor shots looked very good
as i started getting into strobiststyle shooting i became much happer with the lens
the problem is that while the specs claim that this is a f lens its only that for a tiny range at the widest zoom mm and it rapidly drops to f
the lens is far slower than its label and size implyit also suffers from lens creep it will self zoom to mm when hanging over your shoulderfor me the biggest downside is that the range  would be great on a full frame camera but it is not as good on a crop sensor camera like my d
mm is a long telephoto and i dont have much use for it
it could have been useful for indoor sports but at f it is simply way too slow
similarly mm on a canon crop sensor is equivalent to mm on a full frame
it is more of a normal lens than wide angle
for candid shots in normal houses the widest setting  is simply too longso its a good lens if you have a lot of light and a fair amount of room
its far higher in both build and image quality compared to the  kit  used by cheaper rebels
but modern enthusiastlevel canons like the d and d let alone the d really deserve better glassi own  different canon lensesthis lens does everything from macro to wide angle landscapes to mm  mm portraits to telephotoyes there are faster lenses for photographing weddings in a dark chapel there are longer telephotos but this lens does a bit of everythingthe drawback is that this is the only canon lens i have ever owned that has to be refurbished every couple yearsthree times this had to be sent back because the autofocus and image stabilization failedcanon used to charge  to bring the lens back to factory specs but as of sept  canon is charging  to fix the lensand with the way canon is raising the repair costs in  it will probably cost  to have the autofocus and image stabilization fixed againno other canon lens that i own has ever needed to be repaired but this lens has required three separate factory fixin to bring it to factory specsdiscussing this with canon customer service their response is that is the way it is
if you can make the autofocus and image stabilization stop working in  months we fix it for free but if it takes  months for this lens to stop working we charged you again and again and again to bring it back to working conditionthis lens has a great speed and is large enough to shoot in a variety of lighting conditions
its good enough to use as a walk around lens as it can get to a variety of distances and still produce a good shot
the lens creep on this is horrible though so be prepared and be careful as once you tip that lens down the zoom is going to fall right out to the extended position
i find that i need to keep my hands on the lens while walking around with the cam to keep it from dropping out to the extended positioni have had this lens now for three years
it is my second lens
my first serious lens was the canon mm f macro
this lens was intended to be everything the macro prime wasnt
for a while it wasits a good lens no doubt
useful versatile fast and pretty sharp for the price
not super sharp though
beware of amateurs claiming sharpness when they havent seen anything better
the  mm macro kills this lens for sharpnessthat said ive sold framed prints at  x  and  x  from this lens no sweat
but there are a couple of areas where this lens shows its weaknessesi shot a wedding with it  my first
i chose it for the versatility in a high speed situation and it was the right choice amongst the two lenses i have
but it struggled to keep up and outright failed without the flash even when i was shooting at iso  at the mainly candlelit reception
even with is on
with flash  ex and a diffuser it performed very well
i managed to get a couple shots of the newlywed couple entering the reception hall without the flash hand held at  second
yes they were motion blurred  but that was them moving
and the contrast between the relatively sharp areas around them and their movement worked well
the is worksbut upon processing the images from the wedding i noticed that in several shots there was such bad ca that i was literally forced to go in and clone it out
lighting was a cross between natural light through the windows candle light and incandescent
the ca was visible even in x prints of those images
and those were the i do shots
the most critical of all
that really put a bad taste in my mouth concerning this lensso in the end yes i use this lens
its a good one
not my favorite but it is too versatile to pass up until i can replace it with a  fl and a  fl iiprobably more than adequate for amatuers
if youre going to use it for weddings its a decent lens to get started with but youll probably want to replace it with the above two lenses asaplove the lens however the lens slides and u have to refocus again and againcould be very annoying
so i try not to hold my camera facing down when hand held but i do forget so this happensmake sure you buy it with the knowledge that you wont be able to use it to the full extent a wide angle lens is used to
otherwise you will be severely disappointed with this lens
but just how soi know a photographer that uses this lens for wedding photography with her d
for her the lens does the job wonderfully
the lens takes sharp pictures is light enough to haul around in a wedding and wide enough on a  form factor camera to provide sufficient field of view for such event
the field of view on a  form factor camera would be equivalent to mm on full format almost normal viewi on the other hand used my mm lens for nature photography and let me tell you the results were not just disappointing but down right useless
simply stated you will not be able to use high contrastsaturation landscape and nature pictures that are procuded by this lens
the bright sun will cause sever chromatic aberration in your pictures
hence the fringes of trees and light poles for example will display the dreaded discoloration with this lens the color is generally purple
every tree branch at the top corners will become purple at the fringes
those are truly unacceptable resultsnow for the big question is it possible that i had a bad copy
probably not
after being so disappointed i researched this lens extensively especially on fred miranda site and found that others had the same problem
in fact its overall score on that site was  at the time of my research thus my  star rating
after learning the facts i decided to return the lens instead of exchanging it with another one
since then i have ordered a  lshould you order it
this lens is a great value
in fact i rank it as a best value lens after the mm  in the lower end range of canon prime lenses
nonetheless dont expect to take stunning nature photos with it otherwise chromatic aberration will stun youps
i agree with most of what a previous reviewer mentioned in his post but wonder if he owns a good copy
this lens has been in production for a while and there may be a difference in quality between various batches out therepros  sharp center at f sharp corners at f great contrast vivid color reproduction no problems with flaring fast autofocusing has focus ringdistance scale unlike mm f metal lens mount more solid feel unlike mm f decent price cons lots of chromatic aberration color fringing soft corners on full frame af hunts a lot in low light situations noisy af motor this lens is known for having bad copies unsharp at any aperture due to bad glassmine was great thoughsummaryif you want another prime lens to add to your mm f this lens is a good buy especially sincethe mm on a crop  is closer to a real mm mmmm x crop  rebel ddetcimage quality is on par with the mm f but it just has the big color fringing issuesalso another good prime although more expensive at  is the canon mm f i bought this lens for a couple of reasons
first of all i picked it up really cheap used and you can get it quite cheap even new
secondly i really wanted a standardview lens for my rebel xt
but honestly i cant say that i am extremely impressed with it
simply put the sharpness is just not there like it is with say the mm f mm f or mm f
in fact sharpness ranges from equal to worse than the mm depending on aperture
there also seems to be somewhat of a decentering effect where the right side of the picture is especially soft
and chromatic aberrations are on the high side
honestly i dont now how canon went wrong with this lens as the mm f is a very similar design and actually a great lens
oh and like the mm f build quality leaves something to be desiredon the other hand it is better than the kit zoom
and even though it really cant beat the mm in terms of sharpness it does beat that lens in terms of contrast and color saturation
oh and it is cheap
so it may at least be worth considering
but overall i would pass on this lens in favor of the much better mm f
of course the mm f is somewhat pricier than this lens but well worth itthis is a great lense with caveatsi prefer it to the nifty  since you can do everything the nifty can and get much closer to the subjectwhen you have focus deadon it just cant be beat except by a better l macro lensebut like another poster had commented it grabs the wrong focus point at timesi find that anything lower than  simply delivers a fuzzy picture
above  it is sharp as heckim looking forward to upgrading to the new ef mm is macro soon
but ill keep this little gemi needed a macro lens and thought i could save some money
that was my primary reason for buying this particular lens
but im kind of disappointed in it
mine seems very noisy and slow focusing
and while now i finally have macro capability the overall quality is just sosoi have only used it one afternoon for about an hour shooting flowers in the back yard
maybe my pictures will improve
im sure some of the problem is my unprofessional technique but im also thinking that i might have had more fun with a better lens than this one
theres no substitute for good quality and this lens quality isnt the bestif you follow my reviews youll see ive learned the hard way about cheap products
they say you get what you pay for because its truenow this lens is great for beginners who have no idea what theyre doing and want to dabble with macro shots on a budget
sure knock yourself outif you need professional quality macro shots and are using professional gear im on a canon d mark ii then you need the l series lenses
sorry to be that guy but its true
night and day difference between a plastic macro lens and a top shelf l series lens
i would even go with the sigma or something before thishowever if your camera body is only so good ti for example then this is about as good a lens as you need
why put expensive tires on a cheap carjust my  cents speaking from experience only not biasfor me i thought this would be an upgrade to a niffty fiffty but its basically the same thing but with macro  minus the fstop amountlike the  the lens is very slow and sounds like a fisherprice toy from walmart
i had a real difficult time focusing with af
the lens would only af on areas with high contrast in textures as for the fine details you are out of luck
to me the af on this lens is useless
mf is the way to go
i even had some back focusing problems out of the boxit feels and looks better than the  and the close up stuff is pretty cool
but if you are anal like me i would highly suggest getting the mm macro if you do plan on getting this lens or keeping it youll really want to crank up the shutter speed or your focas points will be soft
and turn off the affor less than  this is a pretty decent mm lens but its not the best choice unless you do simple straightmacro work
why
in my experience for  or smaller magnification focusing distance of about m or  ftcanon ef mm f usm standard  medium telephoto lens for canon slr camerasprovides better contrast and image sharpness than this lens at any aperture value
so the only time this lens is the better choice is close distance macro worknow when i use this lens at  to  magnification range the resolution and contrast are good but i noticed a bit too much chromatic aberration ca with shiny objects such as jewelries and silverware
the color is magenta and green depending on the distance of the object in relation to the focusing distance
the ca decreased to some extent by stopping down
a significant drop of ca was seen at f for  and f for  magnification although ca was still noticeable at those fstops
sure at such magnifications you would stop down to about that range anyway due to very thin depth of field but i would be happier of ca was lower from wider apertures for a bit more creative flexibility
meanwhile its not impossible to correct for ca in professional image editing softwares but that just means more editing workthe lens is excellent for nonshiny small product shoots such as hair accessories cosmetic products food etc although tilt shift would be useful whenever the image uses creative styling
therefore for creative macro work tsemm possibly with extension tubes would be more useful although there is a price to pay in terms of dollars pounds and more demanding manual work
whether mm macro is better or worse is not so much of an issue as other people say
efmm f macro provides more working distance and flattens perspective which may or may not be good for product photography but not as different as what you can do with tse mm as a macro lens
the mm tse is a truly excellent lens even if you combine with an extension tube for  magnificationabout the only thing this lens is superior tocanon ef mm f usm standard  medium telephoto lens for canon slr camerasat nonmacro work is that this macro gives more pleasing bokeh than f
but for that matter mm f or tsemm is better and so this isnt a good reason to buy this lensin short efmm f macro lens is good for simple straightforward macro work
if you dont do macro buycanon ef mm f usm standard  medium telephoto lens for canon slr camerasorcanon ef mm f ii camera lens
if you use more elaborate styling or creative work buycanon tse mm f tilt shift lens for canon slr camerasorcanon tse mm f tilt shift lens for canon slr cameras
if you do macro work of jewelry or any other shiny or high contrast objects be careful about chromatic aberration and stop down as neededhaving already owned the mm  and the tamron   i wanted a real macro lens and decided to get this
unfortunately the construction is shoddy similar to the mm  and i could not get a much closer shot over the  overall it was the worse of both lenses i owned
i would highly recommend the tamron because it is also a zoom it is more versatile and can still do nice macros compared to this lensi carry this all day for weddings and at motorsport events its really not as heavy or as big as you might have read try carrying a  f is around all dayif youre debating on getting the is or getting the f because of price that is one thing and only you can decide
but if you make your money shooting for a living think long and hard the f can be stopped to f the f cant be opened to f
you can always turn is off if you dont need it
it can mean the difference between someone paying you for that shot or notyes this is a topend flash but canon sure makes it difficult to use on all but their standard macro lens
i was coming from an opteka rl ettl ii macro twin ring lite flash and the transition was frustrating
first of all the opteka starts out to fit any mm filter size and provides adapters for smaller lenses
with stepdown adapters the opteka will fit virtually any lens
this canon starts out at only a mm filter size which means that larger lenses will be blocked by the ring and thats a really poor design choice
this rig could double as a fill flash on many lenses not just macro if only the design allowed for itknowing that going in i assumed that this would still fit any lens with a mm filter size
not so
it only fits the original nonl nonis mm macro lens
in order to fit the l macro lens you are asked to buy a  adapter which is little more than a stepup ring which should only cost about 
i had assumed it would fit the new tamron mmm macro vc lens because that lens has the same mm filter size as the original canon mm macro
but no the clamps on this ring are designed only to fit the canon
i had to buy a different  adapter which then allows this to fit any lens with a mm filteronce i had that annoyance straightened out its down to the performance of the unit itself
there are two main modes an ettl mode which sets the brightness of the flash automatically and a manual mode which allows you to set the brightness
the ettl mode is easier to start with because you can adjust the flash compensation in your camera
still getting the right balance of flash and background light is difficult
you will need to experiment and should be comfortable using the m for manual mode on your camerathe main problem with macro flash is that the light dropoff is very dramatic and at the default settings you will get a welllit subject with a very dark or even completely black background
this may be what you want for some photos but you will quickly tire of this look as it is not natural looking at all
this combines with the fact that the light from the flashes is too harsh and what you end up with is a very sharp but very artificial looking photographthere are two ways to improve upon this and achieve more pleasing naturallooking photos
the first is to use a diffuser to soften the light
i got some custombuilt ones from the uk on the auction site
secondly you have to find a way to light your background
there are several ways to do this
you can remove one of the flashes and manually aim it at the background
this is difficult to do with only two hands
you can utilize sunlight a slave flash or a light on a stand to light the background
you can use a slower shutter speed to capture more background light
you can turn up the iso and turn down the flash compensation
you can also add some fill light in post
or you can use a combination of these
there are all techniques that you will need to explore on your own to achieve the look that youre afterthis is a wellbuilt but overpriced unit that is capable of very good lighting of macro subjects but only if you are willing to take the time to do some customization manual exposure adjustments and background lighting
i dont like the fact that canon forces you to very limited choices of lenses but now that the opteka rl is no longer available this is essentially the only twin light true flash rig available for canoni was happy to be able to find a compact cassette radio player because these things are almost impossible to buy
bought it for my mom because her old compact cassette radio player was acting up and i wanted to buy a replacement before they became extinctwithout comparing to mp players or hd audio sound the audio quality of the coby is more than adequate
the radio reception is not as clear as id like it to befor the price it is a decent value
the sound is fair
the buttons are kinda cheap
i have seen better made cassette players for the same moneyfor the office it is fine
i still have alot of cassettes i like and it suits me fine for at workthis product is very well made i have no problems with it
my lower rating is due to amazon failing to list the size
it is huge
its  long while i was hoping for something a foot shorter
i hope they remedy their listing by actually including this pertinent information
they list the weight but not the size how much sense does that make
im going to return this and get the pstc which is  longplease be aware although this is a linear filter it does not say so on the website
it will not work with an autofocus camera
so get a circular polarizer cirpl which is more expensiveshooting with this filter sometimes causes a huge cloud of flare on the picture so i need to take it off at times
i think this filter will only serve as a protection to your lens from scratch and nothing else
and its serving its purpose for mehoya mm uv haze protection filteri suppose the overall quality is good and the results for the most part were fine but if the colors at the top edges are already dark deep blue sky for instance the vignetting is fairly pronounced
i can crop or fix in photoshop but i dont want to have to allow for a crop when im framing a shoti bought this device a little over a year ago and use it every day
i carry it on my keychain
i have a few concerns about the appearance and some questions about daily use especially on a keychain that hesitates me to recommend this particular model to otherstechnologically the device is fast and reliable
i have had no problems in over one year of daily useincluding in environments with big static electricity problems including static shocks that travel through the unitthe shape and color are both extremely cool and attractive
i get compliments on this device for both its form and its functionthe durability is very questionable
the circuit board inside is not affixed to the unit so it shakes freely which is probably a good thing since you cant accidentally break it off its internal mountthe device is not watertight
i didnt think this was such a big deal until after several rainy days
the usb connector immediately rusted but the device still works
if the device is required to be on your keychain it should be watertight or at least waterresistant
the lexar device is neither and the rusty insides have made me relegate it to a backup devicethe keychain loop is not large enough for normalsize keychains so you need to use a small keychain loop and not attach it directly to the keychain
you must also have a quickrelease keychain if you plan to remove it as the base is what attaches to the keychainof course the cap falls off constantly and the painted markings will scratch off after only a few daysif this device is cheap i recommend it
i have seen viking and other brands use this exact housing with a different color
since this is only a usb  unit you should expect to see it available for incredibly low prices
even one year ago i got it for less than twenty dollars after rebate which is exceptionally cheapi agree with the reviewers who feel these lexars are not made to withstand very rough treatment but theyre not all that flimsy either
i find them absolutely wonderful for transporting documents from home to work
weve also use them  to copy albums of digital pictures and of course to share fully licensed mpshowever the  meg model is not usb  enabled so the speed needed to make the latter two tasks really easy with this model is not available
id spring for the extra bucks required to get the speed and capacity offered in their  modeldespite the maudio site offering  bit compatible drivers for this card they will not work well
the latest driver causes widespread bsods which have been complained about by owners for over a year now with no response from maudio
the oldest driver set does actually work but if you have any sort of modern motherboard with any features such as ce or speedstep good luck recording because you will experience random unsolvable distortion
also if your motherboard has lots of components you will most likely not even have a low enough pcie irq to satisfy the minimum requirements of this card which will also cause staticlong story short dont buy this card unless you have a windows xp bit computerwhen i bought a new pc recently i installed the current driver and popped in the card
i soon discovered that the driver worked only for xp
as of  maudio does not have a vista driver for this cardi used it on my old pc for over a year and loved it
i wanted  bit audio and this one is an excellent entry level card for  bitif youre using xp and arent upgrading or replacing your pc soon this is a good option
one caveat
the driver may not play well with your video driverthis lens doesnt focus well with my nikon d x and d h camera bodies
i called nikon and was told i need to send the lens to nikon with one of the cameras to have the camera adjusted to work with the lens
thats probably going to cost about  or so
its not good to sell this lens without telling people it wont work out of the box with all nikon slrsnikon mm fd af dcnikkor lens for nikon digital slr camerasi was really hoping to just love this lens but it has been rather disappointing
it is softer than most of my lenses even when stopped down
then the aperature ring started to lock all the time
so i sent it in to nikon complaining that it just wasnt that sharp and the locking aperature ring was a problem easy to fix but really annoying when it locks while you are chasing a toddler at a photoshoot and miss the shot
it just came back from nikon and they claim it is in perfect working condition but the softness i see and the ring problem are due to it being an old design on a new body ds
the rumor is that this lens will be updated in the next year and i certainly intend to buy the newer version that will not have the dc
the dc is sort of a waste too
there are some reviews of it online but the difference between front bokeh and rear bokeh is nearly impossible to notice
and it can screw up your focus
just keep the dc in the center and youll be better
im glad to see nikon ditching the dc technologyi prefer the new lens caps with the pinch grip in the center
spend the extra buck for the newer style lens capits an official nikon lens cap
ive had knock off versions so im just happy it says nikon on it
though when it arrived it seemed rather cheap
either way it protects my glass which is what i paid fordont knw wht to say
lost my lens cap and got this oneserves the purposebig deal
could have been more cheap i believe thats y starsthe lens cap is identical to to original one which i lost and it works perfectly
however i think twelve bucks for a small piece of plasic is a rip
i would have given it five stars otherwisewhat can you say about a piece of plastic really
its to protect a lens
it fits
it says nikon on it instead of canon  thats a good thingworks as advertised kit already came with one now i have extra one
it snaps on and snaps off perfectgood enoughi just dont like the hole in the lense caplooks very cheaobut it serves the purposeit protects my lenseit is set in a plastic clear bag with nikon and its info all over it
it looks fake almost as i have never bought nikon parts packaged as such
but there were all the correct numbering and part numbers on the capoverall it looks and fits correctly
i did feel the edges of it and it feels a bit more sharper then the one that i had with my lens
maybe ill take a light file to it and soften the edgesjust like the title says its a nikon mm lens cap
it works although its really quite expensive for something that comes free with every lensthis cap has a center pinch feature which is great if you have a long lens hood and you cant quite reach down and remove a standard lens cap with the releases on the sides
however because of the center pinch feature there are internal mechanisms inside the cap taking up space that cause it to almost touch the front element when you put it on
if there is a small slight of hand and you mount the cap even a little bit off center depending on your lens it is easy to touch the front element
when this happened for me it left a small mark that i easily wiped off with a microfiber cloth
its still safe for the lens as glass is much harder than plastic but i still consider it a hassle to have to be so precise when putting on the lens cap
also if you were to drop the lens on the front the lens cap would provide almost no clearance between the front element possible transferring the shock to the front element instead of absorbing it
once again this problem only presents itself in lenses where the front element is very close to the front mount so if your lens has good clearance between the front element and the front of the enclosure then you dont have to worry about this problemi really hope that this short review is of some help to those who are out there searching for a nice and affordable camera to buy
there are so many to choose from and so many different ways especially with shopping via the internet to purchase cameras that it helps to have someone help out
youll find that the nikon fm is lightweight but as durable as some cameras that are much more expensivei am an avid photographer and i love two brands of cameras canon and nikon
the nikon fm is a durable and dependable mm film camera
the kit comes complete with everything you will need to begin your new photographic adventure
my only concern for people that are not very familiar with cameras is that you might now realize that this model is not automatic like the newer versions
if you have the time to spend focusing your subjectthen this is a camera that will perform consistently for you
if you are brand new to photography and would like for your camera to do all of the focusing and other adjustments youre likely better off at least reviewing the newer versions of this same camerai have used this camera over and over and over again
in all honesty its as good a camera as any at this level
the photos are always crisp and predictable and the body of the camera has held up well for over  years
ive found myself taking photographs and then the rain would come and soak myself and the camera
even without proper water protection the camera has not shown any problems or any sign of rustingyoull find it easy to load your film and quite easy to get used to taking great pictures
the lens that is included with the camera kit is a very good one and will serve most of your needs
there is a great array of additional lenses and other products that you can buy to add to you nikon fmthe camera was launched to the public as the nikon fm in  a magazine that i like to read popular photography felt that nikon could have done a bit better with this camera outfitbut that was only their opinion
but in  an automatic version of the lightweight fm the nikon fe was also being introduced as a continuation model to the discontinued nikon fe
the fe was retired in  for many nikon fans mixed feelings were abundant about the original launch of the nikon fm
but few could argue that the general mechanics of the camera are good to outstandingtake your time in researching the right camera for you
i think that this would be a great camera for students who are taking an introductory photography class
with automaticeverything cameras its too easy to swith to auto when youre learning how to take photographs in a class
the nikon fm would allow the new student to focus on the true and important elements of photography that are extremely helpful to an aspiring photographeri hope this was helpful at least in part
it was a pleasure to share information with you and id be happy to entertain questions about anything that ive missed in this reviewhappy picture takingpeter cannicescottsdale arizonanot sure if its the kit lenses that came with my d or if its the camera but the viewfinder seems awful dark to me
exposures seem to be goodthe rs from polk can be had for as little as pair if you spot a good sale and are a reasonable buy for under pair
they are small not too heavy and nice looking
like a lot of smaller speakers they tend to open up more when played loudly than they do at lower listening levelsthese ported speakers sound decent with lowerpowered amps i have a proton  maded by nad in the s puts out  honest watts rms but may benefit from higher power in increased accuracy and balance
since my amp sounds a bit warm i found the output from the rs was soft and too concentrated in the midrange at the expense of bass response
they dont have much extended bass and benefit from the reinforcement of a decent subwoofer
i tried them alone and with an nht  powered sub and the low end was definitely improved with the added bass outputcompared to better and more expensive  bookshelf speakers the rs color their sound somewhat with thicker vocals compressed guitars and horns somewhat thumpy bass and drums and a noticible push in the midrange
i found them however a definite improvement over similar size units from sony  or jbli played music ranging from electronica and rock to jazz and classical
hiphop music tended to sound best because there really is no midrange in a lot of hiphop tracks so the speaker could concentrate in the highs and lows
rock songs suffered from tooheavy guitar and weak bass responsebass is improved by moving these close to a wall though the speaker may get boomy and drops off noticably when moved more than a foot outthe bottom line is these speakers are pretty good for moderate stereo systems smaller rooms and less discriminating listening but better sound comes from other brands like nht paradigm or atom for a bit more moneyprice was great
the sound was ok but very low even cranked all the way
too tight
uncomfortable within moments
not sending back giving to a kid who is happy with them and has a smaller headthe sound is fine and they are very light
unfortunately they are light becausesennheiser didnt use enough plastic to make the phones large enough for most heads
these things are really smallif you are anywhere above size  hat try something elsei liked the sennheuser hd  headphone when i first started using them
after using them for awhile they would fall off every time i put my head down to pick something up from the floor
i later bought the sennheuser hd
the hd fits my head and ears much better
i have a small head
j hallthis is my rd sony  cd changer
the first one lasted  years the second one lasted  years and now i just set up my rd one
we use this for whole house stereo and sound is fine
the problem is the skipping everyone else has reported
to me it is worth the  month it will cost me when this one goes out in  years
i looked at other models but reports indicated poor sound qualityso i stuck with this disposable sonyi dare not to buy any more cd players until the engineers can finally come up with a produce that will work without chewing up my cds or skipping a lot and just not functioning
i have owned a lot of cd players and they are all the same
maybe if we can get it designed and manufactured in the usa we can buy one that really works
i am a product design engineer and i have never seen such consistent nonworking cd players in all of my life and career
at age  i am completely fed up with crap cd players
not just sony but everyone
you would think they could have fixed it by now
in order to play the cds i have to play them on my computer
i have a mac with an internal drive that works but i cant seem to get much audio volume out of it
i also have the lightscribe and my cds work fine in it
so maybe vibration is a big part of why cd players dont workthe radio gives you everything you would expect from a small unit
however the headphone jack is a major let down
the headphones are not in stereo and you only hear sound thru one side not bothnot the best sound quality but works well for am which is what i use it for
when using headphones you may only get sound in one ear
i have two of these radios and both have the problem
i have tried different headphones and have the same problemthe felt should have been better quality
other than that i am happy with the purchaseas other reviewers have pointed out the arrows shown on the top part of the brush werent on the one i received
hopefully one isnt supposed to actually orient the brush in a particular direction
also theres no smaller brush to clean the pad itself unlike the discwasher systems of years pastthe fluid is difficult to spread evenly on the pad and tends to accumulate in spots on the album
in terms of cleaning it does a fairly good job  not as good as the old discwasher systemsi feel like i way over paid for this radio based on the visual design factor
the volume fluctuates constantly while listening to the radio to the point that i am forced to get up and fix it several times per hour
i mostly listen to talk radio on it and again as others have said it has an awfully low base tone which makes all voices sound booming further complicating the volume issue
also as others have noted during quiet moments in music there is an annoyingly loud and low buzzing tone which means i cannot use it to listen to music
im not sure why i havent returned this itemsorry folks i meant  to review the model three that i own and i put it in the wrong spot
but if the one is anything like the threethe tivoli model  is one finesounding little radio
a bit bigger than a brick its audio is well balanced meaning that there is solid bass as well as clear and defined midrange and treble
it is truly a pleasure to listen to and enjoy
it has an analog tuner with an led signal strength indicator
the fm reception is very selective and sensitive which is a plus in the signalcrowded inner city
the am reception is average and ok for most local stationsi would have given the tivoli  stars but will subtract  stars for the following reasons
its builtin power supply is cheap and not up to the task of powering its components adequately
during quiet times when the volume level was down very low i could hear a  hz hum produced through the tivolis speaker from across an average size room
additionally when the set is played loudly so that there is a heavy load on its power supply i could see slight dimming of the power and signal leds accompanying audio with heavy bass
furthermore when this strain on the power supply occurs it causes the fm tuner to drift off frequency on some stations
the specifications for the power supply are  vdc at  ma
i called cambridge support at  and they suggested obtaining a filtered power supply
i purchased at radio shack a filtered power supply rated  vdc at  ma
this did the trick
no hum audible and no sign of stress on the new power supply
for a radio of this quality the power supply should be better
the radio shack power supply is cat
no
 be careful to get the correct size and polarity plug tip to fit the tivolis external power supply jack
another star comes off because of the tivolis lack of a switch to switch between radio and auxiliary audio
one must reach behind the radio to plug and unplug external devices from its auxiliary audio jack
other than that i recommend this radio for its great audio performance especially at low volumes
incidentally the amazon product description listed one of its cons being that it doesnt play very loudly
come on guys
its a tiny radio
it is more than adequate to fill an average room with nice sound
for the desk office cubicle or anywhere space is scarce it is perfectcorrection the model one is a mono unit
this is a combination of left and right audio summed into one speakermy comment below is incorrect
the tivoli one is a fine radiosounds great if you like hearing only one half of your music
the single speaker does not playback both left and right channels combined into one it plays just one of the channels
this is especially noticeable when you try listening to music whos left and right tracks are very differentso having sunk  on the radio i pretty much have to buy the second speaker unit now
which will sound great but will be much more than i had anticipated spending on a bedroom radioi own two of these tivoli model ones  the walnutbeige in the kitchen and the hunter greeenmaple in my office
the walnut one is the oldest and most used  purchased in   the gorgeous full sound with rich bass is as much the case for both radios today as when i bought them
if how it sounds on the first day is your only consideration youll buy one as soon as youve heard it because its big sound from a tiny boxreceptionam reception isnt very good at all and is subject to all sorts of interference
but for most of us am performance isnt of much importance
i like many am most interested in fm
i have absolutely no complaints here because fm stations come in strong even being able to capture faint distant signals
fm reception in my rural location is superbcabinetthe cabinet top and sides are real beautifully crafted wood
its a welcomed change from black plastic
the face is equally classy looking but not woodtuning inthe tuning power and volume knobs are shiny smooth  lacking any kind of surface texture or knurling
if your fingers are moist or oily this can be a problem but not a major one
the tuning knob is big bold and beautiful and feels wonderful in its operation like a fine mids era pioneer stereo receiver
you know when the station is dialed in perfectly by the orange tuning led on the radio face which glows most brightly when the signal is at its strongesttuning out
heres where the future isnt so bright
the  year old kitchen radios tuning knob has for several years physically moved all by itself
the result
suddenly youre listening to a scratchy boomy outoftune station requiring you to physically retune it
its absolutely maddening
i have a tiny spot on the counter in a small kitchen where only a compact radio will fit
and as much as id like to throw this radio out the window at times for this frustrating flaw it fits the tiny spot and sounds wonderful but only when it decides to stay on a stationon top of this it gets to a point where all you hear is scratchiness and static when trying to tune a station
to eliminate that you must exercise the tuning knob back and forth back and forth several times just as youd do for an oldfashioned volume knob with noisy dirty rheostat contacts to quiet it down
then the automatic self detuning begins anew
i swear its as if its possessed by a demonim sad to report that the nd tivoli in my office which is used far less is beginning to exhibit these same tendencies but to a lesser degree  for now that isconclusionim planning to buy the digital sangean wr compact table radio to replace my model one based on sangeans high customer reviews
the tivoli seemed like perfection in almost every way when i first fired it up and for about  years henceforth
then the demons awakened and it was only downhill from there
so beware as others have reported the samei really like the quality and the looks of this radio
but in some locations in our home and with some programming the bass is unacceptably boomy
i realize an external equalizer would solve this problem but so would a simple inexpensive builtin tone control and at the cost of this radio it shouldnt raise the cost a nicklebottom line try before buying or be sure of return possibilityjust a comment on tivoli ones fm sensitivity
ive got about tabletop radios and have hooked them one by one to anoutdoor yagi antennai think i just got a bad one but the tivoli had by far the worstfm sensitivity of all  stations that i get wonderfully on my wr orduo were very weak on the tivolii remember the original radios of this type and always wanted onepity that this one did so poorlyfor example i like to listen to a station  miles away
my other radiosget it fine but the tivoli almost couldnt hear iti finally gave it to a lady i know who uses it for a kitchen radioby far the best radio ive had is a boston acoustics with a cd player built inbut the tivoli is just not for dxersjerry odelli had heard rave reviews regarding tivoli radios and took the plunge  purchased one myselfwhile this particular model offers clear precise sound it lacks any sort of warmth or bass responsei was stunned as the sound borders on abrasive at louder volumesquality appears good nice wood cabinet and reception was decent though it would lose signal more thani would have likedfor about half the money you can purchase a sangean w which to my ears blows the tivoli model one out ofthe waterthe sangean has great reception and most importantly a very warm  bass responsive tonethe sangean in many respects is similar to the original boston acoustics receptor radio which isprobablly the best bookshelf radio i have ever ownedit worked until one day it stopped holding stations
we can set it to a station with great reception and clarity and they it will start to fade and the little lights will fade above the off dial and we will have to fiddle with the tuning over and over again
we called tivoli and they informed us that the grease on the tuner may have settled and that we should turn off the radio and turn the tuning dial back and forth many times to spread the grease out again
this did not work and we have a wonky radio
i wish they had just used a digital tuner it does look nicelike the old klh which this replaced when the klh finally after over  years bit the dust
sound is passable
surprisingly the internal antenna works as well as an external one which i did buy but was a wastevery good sound from a box this size very nice stereo headphone output
the tuning started great but degrades quickly just like any cheap transistor radio
 years in and i can barely tune anything in
stations had wandered across the dial and all compressed in
had to open it up and adjust the capacitor blow some compressed air in therethat helped somewhat
they need to go digital with the tuner and the product will be a lot better
granted i wouldnt have this problem if it werent that the only  quality stations are all within  hz of each other all the way over at the thinking mans end of the diali have both model  and model  i liked the simple design and well balanced sound
i was also sold to henry kloss reputation since i used the cambridge soundwork ensemble  years ago
however ive found several irritating problems which prevents me from giving it  or  starts
when i first got the model  i had to return to the store twice because both radios were dead out of the box
the quality control needed improvement at that time
later i got a model  for work
the volume control is very nonlinear
its almost like a stepfunction
the usable range is between  oclock and  its extremely difficult to set the volume right for the office
then i discovered that the model  was interferred by my ham radio transmitting at  mhz
the isolation really should be better than this
most recently i found that the model  is interferred by my new wireless home network
now thats really inconvenient
wondering if model  does better
i also have a sangean wr you can see my review there it has none of the above problems except that the bass is a bit overly done
also the reception is a little better than tivoli
buildquality is very close to tivolitivoli got the right concept about a simple good quality radio
but the execution falls a bit shortthis is a very good radio
but that is all it is a goodsounding radio
it is not highfidelity it is not stereo it is not something you can crank up for pulsating your hardwood floorsi bought this for my home office and am very pleased
for home office use it is generally on low to moderate volume
it is much better sounding than the radio on a clock radio but i have a boom box that i take on picnics that sounds better
since my boom box doesnt fit into my home office decor this one fit the bill nicely
it is nice to look at and very compacti highly recommend this for office or den use where you are listening to npr big band or easy listening stuffi purchased this unit to work only as a network dhcp i guess im glad thats all i wanted it forif you need it for everyday use its slow and clumbsythis product works fine
however very hard to see the small lettering that distinguishes the wan port from the lan ports
i hope i dont have to connect or disconnect cables from the unit too oftencouldnt get the router configured to access the network i returned it
will go wireless and hope for better success
i believe it may work for othersit does what it is supposed to do
basic  mbps router
easy to setup i mean plug in
it is okworked well will use again for other issues i have used thios product on other ocassions as well each time it works out okstand alone cd recorders need blank music cds which have an opc code on them so they can be recognized by the recorder allowing the disc to be recorded on
maxell has had  a very good music blank cd in the past but this is not it
ive had some work a few work only for a song or two and some dont work at all
dont waste your money on the maxell music cds or the tdk which are even worse  they just dont work but go for the sony music cds i tried the ones in the purple package and they work fine
sony music cds have the opc code and they work in stand alone cd recordersfor some reason i got the idea that this cloth would clean the laptop screen on its own but i think it just added a little further smudging
it must be that i also need to buy some kind of solution or spray with which to use it  havent done so yet so my laptop inherited from my daughter remains a hodgepodge of fingerprints
on the assumption that it works well when accompanied by a spray im giving it an average reviewi like the product though i would tend to use a smoothfinished microfiber cloth to clean lens glassas far as microfiber cleaning cloths go ive had better and ive had worse
id rate this one as average there are better ones out therei thought since it was m it was going to be the best
it was a hugh cloth and i liked that but it seem to smear more than clean so i do not use it very often and probably will find another use for it other than my kindle
but i love the big sizethe cloth is very durable great for getting rid of dust but not so good for splatter on screeni like that it is washable and reusablei find that using this on a screen can leave a lot of streaksnot fully clean dustit works on other surfaces just fine but i was hoping for better performance for my laptopphone screenthis is a really good remote for my panasonic tv and sony vcr but it wont work with my ge dvd player
i have a device rca universal remote and it dont work eithermy tv have  modes radio video and tv
i have to use my tv remote to put the tv on video mode to watch dvds
this remote doesnt have a botton to do thati lost the vcr remote and that was the whole reason for buying this one
it does serve that  purpose quite welllisten it does its jobthis universal remote control works perfect the way you input the code for your tv or device is very very simple and that is greatif you wrongly press another button like vcr you just press tv and it works again what i mean is that it does not get misconfigured like others universal controls that i have had in the past
so baisically no qualmsserves its purposeone doesnt work all of the time
i have one in the bedroom that is fine
the button that you press to go back to the last station you watched works
the one in the living room does not
it is hard to change channels at times
it works when it wantstowe bought this to operate a portable dvd player and were not able to get it to work despite trying all of the manufacturers codes including the search feature
screaming at it did not help either
we finally ran over it with a steam roller which didnt improve its performance any but was briefly satisfyingjust your standard telephone wire
purchased it on amazon because it was cheap and i was too lazy to go to the store and purchase onei brought this router and the notebook adapter to share my internet conneciton
setup was very easy just using the quick set up card
the price is just great given that it is  times faster than the prior generation product
the broadband management utility is a nice utility to visually manage and check your connection
the wireless encryption security feature gives you added peace of mind knowing that a roaming intruder doesnt piggy back on your internet connectioni have intermittent disruptions with the laptop to which the router is connected via the ethernet cable reporting network disconnected
this requires a reboot and a labourous disk check up
despite having all the updated firmwaremy suggestion  research other products netgear etc also
make sure you take advantage of a  day guarantee if availablegenerally it works great
starts up quickly easy to set up including wep security good range hums along reliablymy only complaint is that it seems to broadcast the ssid by default and i cant find a way to turn it off
id prefer if my neighbors couldnt see my network so easily
i live in an apartment so this is a serious concern for me
hopefully a firmware upgrade will add this featureinstallation was somewhat lengthy and more involved with a fairly longer manual than expected
it would not sustain a connection initially and i couldnt find an easy and quick tech support  number
eventually i had to uninstall then reinstall twice and reset my access pointrouter dlink dip and i was almost ready to give up
finally it started working and no problems since hopefully never
maybe with the microsoft base station things would have gone smoother
i am not sure why microsoft has to make a bigger and more complicated production out of things and i wish in retrospect i stayed with dlink products
i knocked off two stars because of this
the best part of my purchase however was the seller just great otherwise i probably would have returned or resold iti just received this adapter and installed it almost without any problems
the instructions in the booklet for inserting the card were different from the softwareone said to turn off your computer
i tried it without turning it off and it worked sort of
after completing the installation i still didnt have an interent or networking connection and the signal strenght was poor
we have a linksys wireless routerabout five feet awayafter going through the help screen in the utility menu about four timesit was no help
i finally figured out that it needed the ssidit didnt detect it automatically like the usb version does
to make a long story shorti finally manually inputted the ssid and after tinkering a little more it workedi realize that for a laptop you dont need a really long cable
i had this mouse on a laptop and at that time i would have rated it  stars
then i got a desktop instead and because the towers on the floor this mouses footlong cord is just not suitable
but because i love the ergonomics of this mouse i bought a usb hub to connect it to the desktop
expensive solution huh
it is a really comfortable mouse and i recommend it if cable length is not an issuei got this mouse first but have since gotten the labtec mini wireless optical mouse  and heres whyim one of those who always rolled his eyes at the idea of wireless mice especially for laptops
the idea that someone would need a radiocontrolled device to communicate with a computer that was two inches away seemed ridiculouswell its not
if you hate trackpads i do and cant make yourself spend the  premium for a laptop with a pointing stick i cant you want a wireless mouse for your laptop
i learned this the hard way by first buying a wired mini mouse for my new laptop
i soon learned that wireless mice arent silly at allthat mouse cable which isnt much of a problem for a desktop becomes a huge hassle with a notebook since it has to be unwound and rewound for every work session
worse each winding twists and kinks the cable more and you eventually wind up with a rats nest thats always in your wayso i knew i had to get another mouse but wanted as few things to shlep as possible
most wireless mice require that you add three things to your travel kit the mouse the transmitter and a carrying bag
not this one since the usb transmitter stores inside the mouse itself this mouse is its own carrying casethat much less to worry aboutits so cleverly designed it makes me chuckle with admiration
its just a case of getting everything righti bought this little mouse to keep in my laptop bag
i figured it would be nicer than using the touchpad when staying in hotels
not only that but it is a microsoft mouse so that means qualitywell it is a good quality mouse but there are a few minuses for me
i am not a small guy over this thing is too small in my hand
yes i am a big guy so i should have thought of it but still it is really small
it cannot use the intellimouse software that ms uses with all its other mice
that means i cannot reprogram the middle button as a back button to ease web browsing
the cord is very short to allow for more compact storage
well my laptop has the usb port on the rear left side of the laptopand i am right handed
it barely makes it around my dell inspiron overall just not a good purchase for memy advice would be to try it out in the store before you buyronmmmmm functional but it does noticably dim the computer monitor when my flat screen is plugged into the splitter
this occurs even if my flat screen is turned off and is not in use
please also note the computer screen and an external monitor may not work on the same resolutions
you may have to switch your computer display settings to view either external flat screen or the computer monitor
it can be a bit of a hassel
price is right though and it will work in a pinchive got a small flatpanel over my treadmill that i wanted to run off the same computer as my main work monitor and i bought this to split the signal
the resolution is fine
i can watch movies over the flatpanel while im on the treadmill but the signal to the main monitor is so dim it is really useless for anything other than writing reviews like this so ive ended up buying a vga extenderamplifier and this thing goes into the spare cable binthis item works but i cannot have both the tv and computer monitor hooked up at the same time
the tv will make a buzzing sound and the picture displayed cannot be deciphered
its all snow and lines
but it works perfect if i disconnect one and leave the other in
i was hoping i wouldnt have to do that but at least i do not have to unscrew it from behind the tv to hook up the monitor
i am happy with my purchase even though it doesnt work  like i thought it wouldas far as range of sound this is an excellent and economical system
however the power supply is risky because it overheats
it gets soo hot that you can barely touch it
i turn it off every night because im afraid it might catch firewell ive had this tripod for  months now
i hoped like many others that it was a solid aluminum beast but the truth is it isnt
its mostly hard black plastic
the plastic is ok but it broke on me on the plastic where the legs connect to the central memberi purchased a dolica proline at the same time as this one
so far it has been a better more durable tripod overallthis one outperforms the dolica if its being used for shooting videos thoughthe sony name is good but this product is relatively brittle
i would recommend it only for someone who will use it for lightduty purposesi give it  stars despite the fact that it broke on mefirst im a budget filmmaker
a really budget filmmaker
nonetheless i like to get prolooking results
while im not expecting perfection from a budget tripod for my money i want it to operate as advertisedbuild quality not too bad not too great
a lot of plastic and i had concerns about the reliability of the center brace and leg clamps
the head itself in conjunction with the quick release plate has too much flex for me to be used with a dslrperformance this is where things start to get hairy
like i said the quick release has too much flex to give consistent results and i often find my self tightening the head down only to find my framing off by quite a bit because of how the camera settles in
and this is just with the kit lens
naturally the riser crank isnt smooth at all but i cant really complain about that
what troubles me the most about this though is the operation of the fluid head
there are at least three different spots in rotation where you can feel a jump in the drag force on the head making it completely impossible to get a smooth pan
not only that but the head isnt truly level relative to the legs so you may end up with an unintentional dutch angle when you try to pan around from a seemingly level perspectiveoverall id say its mehtookay for casual use just for photography and basic video but it just doesnt hold up to even mildly demanding workcant seem to figure how to keep the camcorder securely on the top
other than that it works finemy wife bought this tripod for me after an older one broke when i forced a retaining clip that was supposed to secure a telescoping leg segment in place but did not hold well
the newer breed of tripods this sony tripod included have a revised design for the retaining clips
whether the new design will prove to be more robust than the previous generation is an empirical question only time will tell
however after looking at many models both professional and moderately priced like this sony it appeared to me that all had the same retaining clip design
one can only hope that the clips will hold the extended leg segments securely in place and will be less fragile than the previous designthe retaining clips aside this sony tripod has little to distinguish itself from the competition
the tiltpan head does not distinguish itself for smooth movement but it is adequate for the casual use to which i would put it
the black color is a nice touch compared to the pewter color of many other tripods but that is a matter of personal taste
i doubt that sony is the manufacturer of such a pedestrian product and my guess is that they are an oem reseller that inflates the price by marketing it under their own brand name
other tripods in this price range come with carrying cases
this does not though the case from my broken tripod fits it
some tripods have a hook at the bottom of the center tube from which stabilizing weights can be suspended
this model does not
and it is mostly plastic except for the leg tubes and the tiltpan handle
that is not necessarily bad but again whether or not it will stand up under use is an empirical questionbotom line it works but it is by no means outstanding and it does not appear to be any better nor any worse for that matter than the competition in the same price range
perhaps the main distinguishing feature is the black colori needed a travel size tripod for my d and my sony point and shoot
i know this is not like those professional type expensive ones no
but this is very casual and easy to use
of course there are lot of restrictions and limited functionality as to the usage
it wont work as a ballhead tripod if you have used one but this is good for casual travel type requirements
i used it in my trip to mexico and italy
sometimes i found it really not working as i need but then its only  usd vs a  usd onereceived this tri pod in what appeared to be a new condition
the only problem was that one of the three leg supports was not connected to one of the three legs
a  pin or short rod was missing
this made the tri pod unsafe  to use
i needed it for a christmas photo shoot couldnt wait for another  had to pick one up locally
the company focus camera who sold me the tri pod through amazon understood  credited my purchase
thank you focus camerai agree that this card has some very good points when it comes to gaming and other applications video quality in watching dvds is excellent compared to my older nvidia card
i have noticed increased performance speed fps and textures in several games too
however i have also noticed that since installing the card its less than three weeks old as of this writing ive been getting increased system lockups in the middle of game playing and dvd watching something that was never a problem before
ati recommends that you have at least a  watt power supply to get the best performance out of the  pro and so i had upgraded that to a  watt one shortly after i bought the card
the funny thing is i really didnt notice that much difference in performance when i was using a  watt power supply
my computer is also a pentium iii ghz with mb it should in theory be more than ample to run the card flawlesslyi cant tell for sure if the drivers are to blame as been discussed many times
i used the ones that came with the product and also the newest ones from their website and it didnt seem to matter nor did it matter what settings i used
id still get random lockups
and even though im using windows xp the crashes are bad enough to require rebooting of the system
sometimes it takes several reboots before the system comes back to its proper capacity ie after the windows xp logo comes on the screen stays blankno option to do a quotsafe modequot or quotlast configurationquot menu option bootim not even sure if the card is overheating even though it has its own builtin fan and yes it runs fine
as of now im having second thoughts about the card which i had bought due to many great reviews it had
maybe i should have waited for the newer geforce fx as i had never had problems with nvidia cards and drivers like i do now with ati productsi generally like the card but with reservations
if i had enjoyed the stability i thought i would be getting especially considering im using windows xp itd get five stars from me
performance is one thing but without running into the inconvenience of crashes its just not worth itthe only time i havent experienced crashes is when i do light stuff like surfing the net word processing writing email etc
when it comes to quotheavy dutyquot gaming why it crashes on older games dating back to  is beyond me i seem to be missing the boat on this one
your mileage may varymy old realistic radio shack analog receiver out performs the radio reception that this has
this is a nice radio but certainly not the best for the moneywhile this radio is very good beware of sony service and also that sony will use defective parts in its products and then run out of replacements to fix their problems
capacitors that leak all over the circuit board etc rendering the product inoperative
bottom line when you buy a sony radio and maybe other sony products and carry it out of the store dont expect sony to stand behind that product that you spent good money for for more than a few months
instead expect sony to tell you to send it in for repair and then they leave you hanging for weeks and if you finally get curious and ask them where your service request is for them to tell you nicely that they no longer have the parts to fix whatever it is you sent them
this is sonys way of telling you to buy another one
sony does not stand behind the products their life cycle is  months and after that parts not available
but sony will be happy to have you go to the trouble to spend shipping money to send them your product and let it disappear into the sony us service black hole until you contact them to ask where is it
sony does not deserve your hard earned dollar
again once you buy a sony forget service after the salethey could care less
sonys quality is terrible
dont spend your money on sony unless you like repeat buying over and over again
obsolete is what they sell and they dont service it
so plan to throw your unit away if it fails dont waste your time with sony servicewith little use the volume control is noisy
might expect that from a  radio but not a sony in this price rangehow do you program each band to search upper and lower limits cant figure this outits ok butim disappointed in the sw performance which was my reason for selecting this model
the search feature is subpar in my view
if i had it all to do over i would select a model that used the old method of sliding dial selection
the digital scan method used here is veg and does not lock on very well so the result is not many stations are picked up
the fm performance meets all requirements it locks in and the sound using phones is surperb
ditto the local am selection
no problem here
its only the sw operation that in my view is lackingi dont know whats wrong but i just cant access any am station whatsoever
not even turning off the attenuator
fm works fine though
this is an extremely well built unit and would hate to let it goit is a very capable fullfeatured sw and other radio band receiverbutit eats batteries
 hours or so in my experience
there is difficulty in obtaining a v ma ac charger in my searching
there have comments regarding static generation with adaptersit does run down the alkaline aas to the bitter end  approaching  volt
i use nicad rechargeable batteries v charged but there is a modification that needs to be made
the problem is that inserting one of the rechargeables is very tight several brands
so i use a razor and partially remove one of the aa cells overwrapdo that and all is well  fits fine
i think sony discourages rechargables  there is some wisdom there dont mix recharge and normal batteriesverify verify i had placed the sony icfswgr currently in the  range into my shopping cart after reading the positive reviews and yet one attracted my attention at the last moment
within that review the author mentioned that the ac power cord was not includedamazon reported the power cord was no longer offered sony acehg ac adaptor  so i searched about the web to discover the ac power cord is 
at six other businesses the power cord is consistently for what reason would i purchase an ac cord at  the price of the radio  this seems to be a basic inclusion with the product
the power cord to my pc was only   my other electronics came with a power cordthe cord is too short for someone who runs
the sound is average but okay for a headset but i expected this for the price
the headset is a bit thicker than the other cheaper sony headset i purchased which is lighter and has a longer cord
i will use this one for casual listening and the other headset for running
the headset is less likely to snap in half like the cheaperlighter pair i purchased from sony but i am still quite careful with these
its a basic average headphone for someone who just wants something that wont fall out of the ears like the earbudssome people just cant wear them while running
i like this headphone set but prefer the cheaper ones i replaced after they snapped
if the cord was longer it might helpi guess the sound is ok for the price
however the sound is not nearly as good as the sony mdra that this replaced an older model that cost about the same and are a similar style
an ab comparison shows these to sound muddy the midrange and treble sound buriedthis dvd carousel is just ok  it plays dvds well enough most of the time ill get to that later
but there are flaws in the design skipping from disk to disk isnt easy
theres a large pause as it stops at each disk and theres no way to jump directly to a specific disk
you may be thinking bid deal as i did when i read reviews but it really does get annoying
my  year old teac cd carousel could complete five laps in the time this toshiba does one disks can get slightly out of align in their cradle causing the dvd to return a no disk error even though its there
so you have to open the tray and get it back in alignment
not a huge deal but minor annoyance
compound that with the above annoyance and they add up
 ive had dvds not play on this player
i had assumed they were defective and took them back at which time the clerk took it and popped it into their  dvd player and it worked just fine
there were no issues with the region encoding or anything like thatbut on the positive side it works fine and plays movies well enough
i use the optical cable for the audio and it sounds awesomeso it has that going for itwhich is niceupdate  as of january  im still using this dvd player
everything still works great
granted im not a power user who watches tons of dvds but its still ticking after  years of useupdate   as of june  dvd player is still great
no issues even with a  year old abusing it as he loads in his elmo dvds
he pushes the tray in manually rather than using the buttons  still no issues
i must say im considering going to  stars at this point just due to longevitythis is a good overall monitor but its not quotprofessionalquot quality as its name might suggestwhile color reproduction is excellent text can be a little fuzzy especially if you switch to a higher brightness modethere are also two thin horizontal lines running across the screen due to monitors internal design
i dont really notice them on a dark background but they are visible on a white background
its very annoying to see this on a monitor with quotproquot labela nice touch is the ability to adjust monitor settings via downloadable software
there is also ability to autoadjust geometry and other settings to save you time and headacheto sum it up if you are into graphic design or if you mostly work with office documents you should look elsewhereif you want a monitor for games and movies this model will work great for youi sold my five year old agfa ephoto camera in order to upgrade and get something with a better zoom user friendlyness size  battery life
here is what i gotthis camera is definitely light weight user friendly  has a great battery life
but the zoom leaves a lot to be desired
but what could i expect from a  purchase
i looked around all over the net to find a deal and this was itfor the money this camera is worth every penny
will recommend to anyone who wants to save money and buy a camera that is hasslefreethe cd package was open when i open the box
i have not had a chance to use any yet
i hope they are all there
i thought for sure i ordered the printable cds
however with the past  items i have received the packaging has been great
i havent had any problems with the cds in the pastwhat is there to say
they work and theyre cheap for branded merchandise
if youre superstitious about brands and drive combinations pay more money
your loss if you wouldoverall this wasnt a bad spindle
the burned disks last a while
about  in  would not take or lost data after a while but i wasnt expecting miracles here
im trying a new brandi never purchased this brand of cdr but did purchase some images recorded on one
the person who recorded it put an adhesive backed paper label on the non data surface to id the disc
when i noticed the cd seemed to have a defect couldnt read contents i then noticed a blemish on the data recorded side
when i went to remove the label directly over the blemish the entire data and layers easily peeled off
may have been a bad batch but still i dont recommend using any adhesivepaper label to identify the contents of a cdrthe ones that are good work well
many of them are rejected saying they are corrupted
my last ct cake of these were all good
not sure what the problem was maybe something i did
but i had to throw quite a few of them away right off the spindlecdr media is pretty standard this is no exception reliable and cheap but now im buringing things to dvd as the prices have declinedthe record capability is just fine but it was expected that the discs would be printer compatibleneed better representation of product pleasethe bogen swivel tilt head was recommended as a must have to accent the monopod i also purchased  a solidly built unit but totally usless with any monopod
i would give it  stars for qualitysturdyness but zero stars for functionality with a monopod
the quick relase is usefull however but doesnt help in photography just the camera removal
best to get a real tripod with these features already therethese were good headphones for the price but the low price should let you know something
i got these as my everyday beatemup headphones for the gym and to throw in my backpack
they have good sound quality actually but they arent that comfortable
in fact theyre pretty uncomfortable after a while
no fabric to cover the plastic earbuds isnt great and after about  minutes i have to take them out for a while because they start irritating my earsanyway you get what you pay for
i dont regret buying these headphones at all but theyre certainly not  or  star headphonestldrgood sound quality poor comfortthese work okay but i much prefer other ones
the sound is too quiet and is not the best quality
i have bought other cheap earphones with much better soundfor the price these headphones cant be beat
the best part is that they dont sound bad
quality seems good so far however im not sure how long they will ultimately lastedit i was able to purchase this item for about 
theyre good but i doubt that theyre worth these are slightly better than an ipod headphones
not as good as basic sony budsweird because my other panasonic headphones all sound waay better than these
thetreble is not quite as accurate and the bass is moderate at best
the best featureis that the earbuds are very lightweight and i can barely feel themthe headphones respond well to all equalizer settings
sound is very clear very clean but after long use they can get uncomfortable
they are are however more comfortable than the original ipod headphones and they also perform better than the original ipod oneslet me just say this it does the job fine however if your looking for a affordable earphone with deep bass this item is not for you
the volume can be loud
however the bass is sorta midranged
i personally prefer deeper bass
i also find myself orienting the earphone just to get its full potential which can be irritating at times
keep in mind im not saying this is a bad earphone
its actually good but not great far from excellent
overall satisfactory of this item is a solid bwelltheyre cheap thats for surefit  pretty poor
theres no foam sleeve or outer wrap to help the earbud stay securely in the outer ear
so they feel as if theyll easily fall out if they are not placed exactly the right waysound  pretty poor
theres no bass whatsoever
sound really lacks any definition
sobe forewarnedbut they are cheapthey have good sound but i find they are too big to fit inside my earbut for the price their not badthe wires are very thin and tangle easily
sound quality is okay for  pricei dont use these for listening to high fidelity playback but for talk radio and casual listening these do fine
more expensive buds arent needed for thatthe model two is a great little unit which i think works great on its own but the subwoofer is also a good addition
i like having the option to upgrade the set and this is a recommended addon
if you already have the model  and you like it then youll be happy to get this
if you have the model  and are disappointed then getting this would be a losing battle
it does not transform the sound  the addition is subtle but good
if you already like the model  then this will support that appreciation
if you arent satisfied with the model  then this may be more money for something not that different
the subwoofer improves the low end and makes the sound a little fuller but does not transform it
i like to use the model  as speakers for a small television i have set up which doubles as my computer monitor
used this way the model two is a perfect fittivoli is tightlipped about the actual performance characteristics of its equipment but does state that the subwoofer extends the frequency range of the model two by one half octave
the ratio of hz frequencies per secondto octave differences are  to  one octave up is twicde the hz and one octave down is half the hzso if the model two extends down to about  hz a reasonable guess fir  drivers then the subwoofer further extends down to about hz
not a lot of help just a small tweak
thats not much for 
it wasnt too bad at the subwoofers original price of about  but at twice the price its little for the price
however it will tweak the sound it its own small way
if you  want lots of unrealistic thumpin bass get something else like dr dre ear phones or such childpleasers that add extra emphasis to the low endthis is an exact repacement for my radios
does the job
its hard to believe they cost as much as they do but there isnt much alternative other than replacing both radios with new ones
just used the pair this weekend skiing with my sons
they work greateven though this unit comes with several different cups meant to accomodate different radio models it doesnt work too well with my older motorola talkabouts
none of the cups makes for a snug fit and the radios just sort of rest loosly in the charger
it still works and they get charged but you have to balance the radios just right in the charger in order for contact to be made so that the batteries get juice
and slightly bumping it will knock the radios around and youll loose the connection
i suppose this is a nonissue with newer radios that i assume fit snugly and properly into the chargeri thought these were batteries that could be charged while i used my radio
the picture is true but it makes it look like it is a battery charger
they arent
they must be in the radio to be charged
unfortunately the batteries dont last all day if you use them all day
we are communicating in a campground and i have to switch radios at about pm
we ended up sending these back and buying extra radios
motorola you need to make a battery charger so i can charge the battery and switch when neededthe quality of memorex cdrs has been going slightly downhill for years
as soon as they were outsourced to chinai got lucky with this batch only  disks were bad
it varies though some of them have zero and others have had as meny as  bad disks
sad but memorex is still one of the best brands out therethe description says lasts forever with simpletechs lifetime guarantee but when you get it you will find out that the limited warranty is only  yearlooks like a nice case unfortunately it does not fit all ipaqsi was having trouble finding a pair of headphones that stayed inon my ears when i ran
the ipod headphones were definitely a no go and i invested in a pair of sony that fell right off despite their sporty claim
my mother had these and i sat down and ordered my own pair that same night after running with them once
the sound quality is decent for the price and they stay put
i usually run  miles  times a week and i have had them for about a year now
i havent had a single problem
if you are a stickler for sound quality these might not be the best bet but if youre using them for runningan on the fly pair its not a bad investmenti would have to agree with the reviews stating the awkward design of the actual earbud of these
they just do not stay secure no matter how you try to bend the wire that wraps around your ear
you can shove them in if you try hard enough however you better not twitch a muscle cause when you do they will fall out
if you press the phones to your ear and hold them they sound relatively good
pretty good highs and mids and decent if a bit muddy lows
if the phones actually stayed in i would give these a  of five for their price rangefirst of all ill give this one point for style
it looks good and has a very low profile so that others cant really tell youre wearing it without looking up close
another point is that i got this for working out
it definitely stays in place and i use it often because other ear buds tend to fall out of my ear when jogging
this would stays perfectly in place
another point ill give because its easy to slip into your ear
other buds that clip around your ear usually take both hands to get it adjusted just right
this one i have no problem wrapping it around my ear with only one hand and a quick turn of the wrist
the only issue is the sound which is poor
koss is a great brand that makes nice headphones but these sound lame
the bass is too low and drowns out any highs
very little fidelity compared to other ear buds ive gotten as stock headphones with mp players from sony or creative labs
i usually learn spanish when i workout so it serves its purposes of staying in place and there is no need for rich sound
if you want headphones that are comfortable and will stay in your ear during heavy activity these do the job
if youre looking for sound quality definitely go somewhere elsedid not find the sound quality to be any better than any other garden variety earbud
bass response is average which means generally not so goodon the plus side they are very comfortable and you can wear them for hours without discomfort and the wrap around wires are very handy for exercise
bottom line  highly recommended for active use but if you need a more full bodied rounder sound with stong bass and midrange get another headsetthey are ok headphones i dont consider myself an expert but i wasnt blown away i guess for the price its a good buy
i just needed a good pair of headphones for running and for tha they are okthey dont fit that great and let in quite a bit of wind noise when im riding my bike above  mileshourother than that i think theyre ok  when im lying in bed its necessary to push them in to equalize the sound otherwise one of them will insert further than the otheri guess nonslip is a loose term
true enough hear headphones arent likely to come off entirely but they are likely to slip during most exercise routines
the bud design is clever but even for my big ears the clip fits loosely enough to allow the buds to jar out of position
because the sound flows away from the ear canal this makes average speakers even less enjoyable
however this is the first pair of headphones ive owned that werent slaughtered by the rigors of a sweaty run
the design keeps sweat from drowning out the sound halfway through my three mile
the cord is also perfect length for sliding in my pack or my ipod tunebandthese are great at the lower x setting but are kind of blurry at the x setting so i tend to not even use that settingat  power the field of view is bigger but what you see is a smaller circle through the eye piece
at  power the circle fills up the image through the eye piece but the field of view is smaller
it would be nice if the image through the eye piece was constant at all powers
i ended up leaving setting at around  power
the size of binoculars is handy and confortable when usingyes it is good to see a show theater or birdsbut not enough in qualityi knew it when i bougth itll be usefull when im going to see odd things at contrysideits quite expensive in brazil something like thatdont expect to much for somenthing cheapthis item is what i wanted to connect my newly purchased from amazon binoculars to my tripod
problem was the threads on the adaptor were not well made or not checked by a quality control person
but againa fellow in my office has a die set and was able to clean up the threads and the adaptor now works perfectly
i dont like sending things back and was glad to fix it up so it would work but this should not bethis is a brilliant amateur camera for what nikon calls the prosumer market consumers who fancy themselves professionals on the basis of having taken pictures for cousin georges wedding
when used with nikon lenses and accessories it performs extremely well and is rugged enough but lacks those features that allow adaptation of the camera body for technical uses live tv monitoring bellows use or anything that made the f series wonderful for innovation in imaging
in other words if you want nikon to dictate the limitations of your cameras based on marketing concepts this is a swell camera and cheap
on the other hand do not think of  the d as a backup to professional cameras as the nikkormat was for years
neither should one depend on the owners manual to be  forthcoming about the cameras  limitations the telephone help line is hopeless and the best information is on nikons uk websiteits strictly prosumer mancable is a little stiff doesnt bend very easily
put it on my blue ray player and has a good clear picture
thanksthe connectors are too bulky to fit next to other connectors in the back of most receivers
not necessarily worth the higher cost of monster brandi own about  sets of these and these are no better then any of the others
in fact monster are superiorultimatly where it makes a difference is in the connector and the quality of the fiber
since the signal doesnt have to travel a great distance the quality of the fiber doesnt really matter all that much unless its so bad that it actually attenuates the signal
but thats really badsecond the connector is the most important part of the cable
since that is where the end of the fiber is and where the lite must leave the fiber it has to be either clieved very well or highly polished so the signal is not refractedall of this attention to detail adds to production so ultimatley you get what you pay for
paying  for a monster cable is very reasonable
if you were to buy a professional cable you would pay close to  you dont see those cables on amazonthis is a good quality cable no problems there
just dont try to remove it the connectors are so tight youll need a pair of pliers
seriously
and be careful connecting them  you have to push so hard to work them on that you run a serious risk of damaging your equipment especially if youre going into a plastic housing like an ab switchive tested these cables on multiple pieces of equipment along with other cables belkin
these are not snug
they are borderline damaging
i would not recommend unless youre setting up something like an av cart that will see a lot of movement and abuse and you dont want the cables to ever come loosethese cords sound great and feel really durable
i am currently using them to hook my numark board into sound equipment and they do the job nicely
they sound good the hookups are solid so all is well rightnot quitethe connection tips and thick rubberized cable are connected by a bulky and ridged plastic
the kind of plastic youd expect to find on the dash of an old gm
the reason is to hold the thick rubber to the rest of the cord however this makes it very difficult to plug in the cords side by side on select unitsi feel these cords will hold up longer than most rca cords but that ruggedness comes at a space costthis is a cute little unit thats perfect for students or first timers
the screen is nice and sharp and it doesnt need batteries
the memory is small though and the rubber flip cover is annoying
you should opt for the blue carrying case which lists for an additional amount
overall this is a nicely done product for the pricei bought this palm to replace one that i had lost palm iiixe
i thought why not go with the newest palm out
i got the zire happy that i did not have to worry about batteries and a hotsync cradle and i thought the price was great
once i got it home and took it out the package i plugged it up to the computer and turned it on
the screen was nice and crisp great size and weight but no back light
my wife said that is something you can live with out so against my feelings i decided to keep it so i synced my palm to put my info into the new palm
during the sync process it froze my computer and the palm froze
i tried this about  times then said something is wrong here so i took it back to the store for a new one the ran out so i got the m
this one worked well it synced with no problem
then i realized what happened when looked at all the info i had on the m it was  mbs of memory
the zire only has mbs
bottom line is if you are a serious palm person this  mbs gives you no room to add anything to this pda
the zire may be good for a hs
kid or some one who is looking for a glorified phone book
all in all this is overpriced and should not have the palm name behind iti looked into this model to replace my sons ailing m palm pilot
at that time the m was the entry level palm on the market
there were design issues with that model and several componants and in fact the entire unit was replaced by palm during the warentee period
i will say that even though the customer support was a bit spotty some reps would say they couldnt replace only to have the next one say they couldit was overall quite good
due to good support i felt comfortable looking at the brand againultimately i went with a handspring model for the bigger screen back light and larger memory
with this models memory  it is difficult to justify the purchase if you plan on putting on additional software
there are many small programs that could be loaded but just a few good size programs would hog all the memory entirely
he had a few homework manager type programs on him m same size memory that required the bulk of the space
being a child he wanted some games too or what was the fun of it  ie what was the incesntive to not lose it
some graphic intensive games themselves are quite largewe were always taking off one thing to load something elsei find palms screens a bit hard to read without reading glasses something my child doesnt find hard to do but since i am loading and maintianing the unit it mattered to methis isnt a bad unit by any means
if your needs are entry level and will stay there perhaps this is a good choice
if your need to load software will be minimal this might be a good choice as well but im not sure that is something you would know when you purchase
it is usually better to purchase the most technology you can afford
and the newest
this version of os is not the newest
some available software will not be written for it
most will but some will be written for  a newer os i also had to make a decision to choose an older os witht he handpring it is a give and take for featuresfor a bit more money you can get quite a bit more whallop
and for a modest amount more you can get a significant amount more whallop
im afraid that with this unit you are starting at  steps back alreadyunless as i said your needs are very minimal and will stay that wayi really liked how light and small this was but it was limited to mb of memory and was bampw with the release of this pda at its time really was a bummer
all the pdas on the market were color so the applications you could download were limited
also the was only mb of memory and you couldnt expand
if it was released a year ealier it woulda been way more usefulthis is the third time the lens mechanism has broken
the first one was with a similar c and it was repaired under warranty
the second time it broke it was not under warranty and too expensive to repair
i thought the lens looked sturdier on the c but it failedthe mechanism that moves the lens in and out failed
it had taken two pictures and then the next picture the lens just got stuckive pulled the camera apart  but cant get the lens out  maybe ill try againits too bad because the lens was good for the cameras compact size for its age it was fun to use all the controls and it was very good in low lightmy other camera i had to sell on ebay for parts  i fear this will go the same wayim not an avid photographer but i do like my photos to resemble the colors and shapes that they are in real life which was not happening with my old kodak easyshare
it sufficed for photographing things to sell on ebay andor craigslist but not much morei received the olympus c as a handmedown from my aunt who wanted to upgrade
she used the camera for a trip to italy and is the very definition of enthusiastic ps photographer and it took gorgeous photos so i had high hopesit does take very nice pictures
i wouldnt know a chromatic aberration unless it was pointed to me but the colors and shapes are true
you can play with the exposure time which is nice
flash is a must when taking indoor shots and it can overexpose in this way
you also have to use the lcd over the viewfinder because its the only way to ensure the focus is correct
but for the most part im very pleased with the photoswhat is making me want to upgrade is the onoff mechanism as well as its speed or lack thereof
i have promised myself never to buy a camera with a sliding door as the power switch because it has been spontaneously shutting itself off even if im very careful in not touching it
also it takes about  seconds to fully start up from the moment the door opens to when you can actually take a picture
probably okay if youre taking pictures of things that dont move but definitely not a camera you want to take to the zoo or a partyalso the flap that covers the usb port is a flimsy sort of rubber and was open and flapping away when i got it from my aunt
same with the power portto conclude it takes nice pictures but is so slow it probably doesnt suit most peoples needspros mp resolution in a small welldesigned metal body allows a great deal of manual control good color reproduction higher than expected contrast from tonal balance low image noise with moderate shutter speeds spot metering shooting priority play mode double press of quick view button good night exposures with automatic noise reduction solid build quality bright high resolution lcd monitor with antireflective coating included infrared remote control decent battery life but id still recommend getting a spare compact dimensions  x  x  in weighing  ozcons some purple fringing  chromatic aberrations noisy images quotjaggiesquot visible limited adjustment on image parameters no manual white balance no manual focus some blue cast using the flash no af illuminator high redeye occurrence poor movie mode when compared to competition manual is on cd lcd not very useful in very low light glacial write times for tiffs slow image write times raw format not supported you cant slide the lens cover to turn the camera on and off when mounted on a tripod nor can you change the battery or xd card poor macro ability fastest continuous shooting speed is only  fps no histogram display in record or play mode the supplied mb xd card is inadequate
be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for more memory the batteries supplied are proprietary so add a few bucks to your budget for a sparethe cz is a decent camera with mp resolution in a compact package
but there is no manual white balance and no manual focus plus the images compare unfavorably against its competition
at this price point check out the canon si hope this helps you in your buying decision
peaceas reported by others my lens cover is giving up its ghost
the camera does not turn on everytime on first attempt
opening the cover and general cleaning did not help
the powerdown mechanism is still very effective though  sometimes in the middle of composing a shot it would power down at the slightest provocationit was a great camera  years back with a solid feel and a compact size then
now it is neither here nor there the superzoom cameras have made a x optical lens obsolete or entry level only and the really compact cameras have made this look like a tanklosing a camera in slightly over  years is not good my minolta slr from  is still functional a i suppose it is time to buy again and i will buy another olympus this time  probably the e with dual lens kit
that would allow me to use the current remote  and i have been very satisfied with the opticsworks wellit  works
not so sure what to do to clean the brush from gathered lent particles
some have the  spin  brush feature to sling off particles  and entergize the magnetic field to  gather new dust particles
oh well it  does look  good and it has a nice nikon brand  name on iti was looking for a good pocket lens cleaner for my dslr
this does an okay job but more often then not i have to use something else
if it is simply a matter of dust this is the perfect toolit is a little massive for a pocket but still a great item to carry for that quick dust off and get back to shootingdont choose this as your only path for lens cleaning when out on a shootmy first item arrived damaged
the package broken and the item inside damaged on the area of the clip
so both ends still workingthe idea is great and it really get the lenses clear without fingreprints or other stains
a lot cleaner and handy that the old cloth technique
sometimes i combined with a giotto blower but i found that the brush is many times enoughmy problems with this products were  arrived damaged   the cap does not fit the brush end logical place to put it so you cannot put it there while using the chemical tip and you end with the camera the lenspen and the cap on you hands  the brush is starting after a week of frequent use to were out leaving some hairs on the lens
and  the tip with the chemical that makes the trick gets replenished only by touching a very little sponge on the cap
inside the pen there is nothing but air and the plastic that moves the brush in and out
then i do not expect this cleaning pens will last much longer
very disappointed since i thought that being branded nikon it would be better constructed like not leaving its hairs backi will get another because it really works better and faster than the cloth but i would try the lenspen brand to see if it last longer than the nikona great product that last shorter that expectedi wear plastic frames with glass lenses
since there are no nose tabs i tend to get facial oils on the lenses
this pen just smears them around
i am buying the microfiber cloths that i know work
i wish that this lens pen worked for me
it would have been just what i was looking for
oh well
at least the price is lowthe thing i hate about this is that cap always seems to fall of easily
other than that i have found it to be alright does its job when i need to clean dust of a lenseits okay
but is also nice to add to your must haves for your nikon camera
you will like iti was primarily looking for a good lens brush and this one fills that need
however the brush end is unprotected from dust or lint from a camera bag or pocket
a cover for the brush end would have been good like a lipstick design brush
i havent used the cleaner feature yet as i have some hesitation about applying liquid to lens coatings and would do this only as a last resortbrushes dont work very well on camera lenses because they just move the dirt around or put dirt on the lens that was already in the brush
buy a rocket blower insteadhelloi had a nice lens pen that received as a gift and another one that i bought for cheaper
i wanted another good one as a spare
so i looked several models and selected this based on the good comments
i received the package pretty quickly but when i opened it i was a little disappointed with the quality
on the brush end the hair is not cut evenly and to the other end the flat cleaner is glued to the body with a cheap glue and when you open the cap everything movesit will do the job but for this quality you can find for cheaper
i was expecting a nicer product for the price
hope this helpsin the meantime ordered one from adorama which was cheaper and shipped faster
one side works well for eliminating smudges and surface scratches the other is a brush for whisking away dust and lint
pretty basicits ok does what it does cleans 
its nice to have in your camera bag and does not take up much room even in the smallest bagsbecarefull when you use this guy as the hairs will break free of the pen and you might not know it until after you look at your picturesnikon lens cleaning pen works great for me
i generally use it in one or two months on my mm vr lens
good productfor the price the tool is not bad
the brush works well around the edges of the lens but take care not to touch it as even clean hands will leave a bit of grease on the brush and it does smear the lens
im not entirely impressed by the round tip polishing tool
i ordered  of these pens and  lenspens by the way  they are absolutely identical and im sure they come from the same factory just with different brands  dont be fooled by the price difference
so far i used one nikon pen and one lenspen and both left a bit of ghostsmearmarks on my lenses  not impressive at all
after using the pens i always have to give the lenses a wipe with a cleaning cloth alsoi would approve the use of this tool though as there is no other way to safely get into the tight corners of the lens area not with a cloth anyway and also on the sensor side of the lens where you have even less space to work this does come in handyas closing remark  i will not get anywhere close to a sensor with this pen
it is not being sold as a sensor cleaner but just in case you were wonderingmine started shedding the first time i used it
im glad i bought the rocket air blaster along with it to blow the hairs off my lenses after cleaning them
its a good little tool but it sure seems to be falling apart quicklytried to use this on a very sensitive lens and the pad at the end left little smudge marks
they were easily removed with lens cleaner but this was not the best buy for my needs
great idea thoughi received this today and firstly let me say the brush end is very nice the brush is soft and i feel comfortable using it on my lenseshowever the other end of the pen with the cleaning tip is of concern to me and i advise caution for the following reason
i took the common sense approach of testing it on something other than expensive glass before using and to my alarm when brushing it against my hand it left a black smeared mark
i tested it further and every time i brush it against anything it leaves a black smeared mark
it seems apparent there is some kind of black dye in the cloth tip or something along those lines i found nothing in the paperwork to suggest this was normal either way i do not think you want to use anything on glass that leaves a mark
especially since it was not that easy to wash off of my hand let alone anything elsevery strange needless to say that part of the pen will not be used by me anytime soon
be aware of this and check before trying this maybe a freak occurrence on my brush or it may not
terrible quality control by nikon there i thinkthis does work but a squeeze blower and a lens cloth do just as good a job from what i can seei got this in a kit with a gorillapod and i really liked it because it was so compact
i never used the spray but the brush was great for getting rid of dust quickly in the field
i like to travel light and convenient so this was perfectunfortunately the glue on the brush head is both cheap and applies directly to plastic a major nono
after about  trips this thing broke down on me
thats not bad except most photographers wont see this last for more than  monthsi dont get it
what is it
a brush and some type of felt pad
it does not remove it blends
best way to clean is to use a gotti blower lens tissue and lens solution
a brush is good to use as well
i blow off my camera every time i use it
not worth it really
a brush would be just finethe brush is the only thing saving this item
the lens cleaner is terrible
plain and simple
the brush is nice compact and pen shaped so its easy to holduse
i would not replace it with the same item if i lose it etcworks well enough but feels cheap
ive used it a few times now and its effective and clearing away dust from the lensgood idea and design but targus has one almost identical except it has the retractable brush on one side and a cap you remove on the other side that covers a small spay nozzle
it comes filled with cleaning solution and a cleaning clothsometimes a brush just wont get off the fingerprints the targus tgklpc just seems a lot more versatile and effectivethe targus pen is available at radio shack for  as well as tons of online storesive had this for about  months now and it gets a pretty regular amount of use
my favorite thing about this is its light and it has a clip so it fits in a shirt pocket for easy access during a videophoto shoot
also the nonbrush side im not sure what that thing is called looks like a pad works great and ive never had a single issue with that end of the pen which is why im giving  starsnow for the downsides it sheds like crazy and it has since day one
i had hoped it would stop over time maybe a few loose strands from shipping or something but it as been very constant
in fact it has gotten to the point where so many have fallen out and the glue that hold the whole brush in stopped working and the whole brush has actually fallen out all together
i was able to shove it back into place and i hope to get a few more months of use out of it but i can already tell its on its last leg though the design is great i will not be buying this particular brand again as it just doesnt last long and the shedding can become a major issue if you dont have time to triple check your lens for strands from the brush
not to mention you could get an even cheaper version and probably have the same issues but save yourself a couple bucksit serves its purpose
i have had it on several vacations and it heldup well relatively
if i buy again i would just go with a kit because it is more bang for your bucki bought this item as a gift to myself in december and was excited to own something compact and contained as opposed to my microfiber cloth i was using
while i enjoy the brush to remove debris from my various dslr lenses the other end came filthy black and turns everything it touches black including my lens clothing and skin
obviously defeats the intended purpose of this item
looking through the reviews i am not the only person this has happened to
just a heads up to those considering purchasingi purchased this product based on the reviews
im happy with the ability to clean the smudgesfingerprints using the carbon pad
after you gently rub on the lens using the carbon pad you can see carbon powder leftover on the surface
its not big deal since you can clean that off using the brush on the other sidemy issue is that every time i use the brush at least  bristle breaks off and gets stuck on the edge of the lens
this is the most annoying because when that happens i have to use my finger to remove those stuck threads and then have clean the lens againonly time i didnt have this issue is when i clean my nikkor  mm with uv filterit doesnt have any edge where threads gets caught on at all times
i rarely remove the uv filter from that lens therefore the lens itself requires infrequent cleaningnot sure if it just a defective product or its normali got this from amazon warehouse and it barely had any of the cleaning compound in it
i twisted the tip in as far as possible but there was very little residue when i removed it
and its brand new
the brush works fine but the bristles seem to come out easily
i could probably give this pen two stars and call it a day but im assuming it normally includes more of the compound i watched a youtube video on how to use these things ha so ill go with you should assume the battery is the last to give up on a pda right
no
my sj works in just over  year and the battery has some problem
initially it seems it can never charged up always stuck with  then 
well one day it gives  again
so i keep on using it until suddenly it collapse without any warning
strange thing is even with power plug in the clie cant be turned on
either the cable connection is not right or the battery has charging problem
however the light is on showing power is pluged ini heard about same bad story about the touch screen on another one year old cliewhat the heck is happening to sonyso ive been using my logitech io pen at work for a week now
it works fine
installation was easy
viewing the notes is simple
converting notes to a microsoft word image not ocr  i didnt buy the ocr software is simple
docking station is convenient
carrying a pen and notebook into a meeting is much easier than carrying a laptop
technical note im using the newer version  of the logitech io software
so why three starsfirst the pen is huge
about six inches long and  of an inch in diameter
if youre in a meeting taking notes you get a lot of stares from coworkers what the heck youre holding
kind of disconcerting
and i work at a software company in silicon valley where there are plenty of early adoptersanyhow people invariably ask for a demo during which they are pretty surprised at how it works
after surprise comes judgement  people either think its cool or think its a very stupid geekly gadget
one coworker thought it was very cool and wanted to buy one for her husband
several folks just roll their eyesi just want a pen that gets notes onto my pc not to feel like i have the st century equivalent of a pocket protectorlogitech needs to make the pen smaller and less conspicuous
until they do i fear that this product will not make it through the chasm and make it to mainstream success as the ipod blackberry palm pilot and canon digital elph all have doneform factor matters as much as functionality and the io is not quite there in its form factor
its too big
logitech please make it smallerso if you see a like new io pen being sold in the near future it might be minelogitech has produced a truly innovative product the io digital pen
rather than struggle in the effort to create a paperless society many companies have tried in the past decade logitech is trying to marry the two technologies
the io digital pen is a great idea targeted specifically for students and designers who do a lot of writing and sketching but still find having a digital copy of their document handy
its features as a pen are great however the digital aspect still requires some work
read on to see what we thought of the penfull review  bytesectorcomthis product looks like a brand new idea
however this idea has already been introduced in asia long ago
last year a new product penpower true ink has hit the market
anyone who is interested in this product can simply do a google search
compare these  products the advantages of io is its independence and ease for carrying anywhere
but the hidden charge for the electronic paper is kinda tricky as logitech doesnt mention much about it
at the same time with trueink real people just use real paper
it also has ocr to translate the handwriting into typing
but the problem is its still considered as an input advice
that is you gotta have computer aside while using it
the usb cable is long enough to give you some flexibility
i think soon there will be cordless usb cradle for it like the one for io
the company is also expecting blueteeth tech will lead it into a new erabottomline is i would like to see the combination of these  but unless you just wanna get something cool its still a bit risky to use io in a daily basisoverall seems to be a decent qualityits not a double din its more like it did not fit on my truck which is a regular double din
overall shipped fast and would work for idk what vehicleprice was great  but i will be returningthis kit worked good in my  ford expedition i had to trim the kit a little with a razor
its made a little cheap but works good i like very easy to installthe piece came broken due to poor shipping the pieces didnt fit very well had to modify a bit next time i will buy a different name brand that costs morei have this stuck into the hole
it is not secured well
the instructions were difficult to follow and you have to wonder whats going to keep the radio in place
it fills up the hole but is not clipped in well
i was expecting a little more substance
shipping was promptkind of cheap quality
it does install in less then a minute and it looks very clean and flush
i would recommend this
mercury mountaineer  mach radio removed for thisif you are wondering what or how to use this check out my youtube post on it
netcommercial is my page the title to find it is azden cam mixerworks fine
as stated by others it is not an amplifier just a pass through for multi mics
 ins and one outmake sure you use the right decent cables to reduce any static or hiss as complained about
it is not a pro mixer but will work in a pinch for  bucks
like if you are lapeling two people and one is dominant over the other
this will allow you to bring down the dominantnot for boosting a soft spoken person
you will need to catch that in editing
yet if both are at the same level at shooting it makes it easier to crank up the whole track in editing then trying to do it on the flyi did try it with using an azden lapel and an azden shotgun
there is obvious pick up diff for the different caliber mics
yet as stated if you are using a couple of lapels of the same make you will find it a handy goodie in the bagif you use this mic in short mode youll be fine
the quality is pretty impressiveforget about the long mode
its worse than your internal mic on your dslr or camcordernow the big downsidethis mic does not have a light indicator that tells you whether the mic is on or off
bad bad absolutely badif your battery is out you wont know if it is out when you turn on the mic because theres no indicatoryoull be filming with the mic switch turned to on when in contrast the mic will be off because the battery would be outafter a great shoot when you playback what you shot youll only get silencevery bad designhowever taking only one aa battery to run this mic is a big plus
makes the mic very light in weightive had the bic dvb speakers for about  weeks now and believe they are broken in
im using these as computer speakers with a lepai  watt amp
they have a good sound and sound better than the computer speakers i had hooked to my computer
the only problems ive come across is that these speakers are not made to be set on a flat surface and will wobble if you set them on a flat surface
they are made to be connected to a wall or ceiling with the appropriate mounts
i had to use blutack to get them to set on my desktop properly
the other problem is when cranked up and they will play loud the plastic enclosures resonate a bit at some frequencies and you can here this
the problems being stated they do sound goodthey cant compete with my pioneer spbslr speakers that i payed  for
ill probably end up replacing the bics with a pair of mica mb speakersone of the speakers has a bad rattling sound during any heavy bass output like maybe the woofer is damaged
wish i could have sent them back for refund
plan on getting a pair of mica mbs and hope they are good speakersupdate contacted bic support through their email and they sent me a replacement woofer
they do sound better now but still have some cabinet resonance during intense passages
theyll do for now but i will eventually replace them with a pair of mica speakersafter having this a year i now can say the voices are not very clear and dont carry faryes i can turn the center up some when theyre talking low but then its too loud a second lateri assumed was the movies faultbut i hooked up a old techcics bookshelf n did a side by side with the same part in several moviesand then musicwondering if i can get a diff tweeters in itprobably not enough roomi use this in a small room so it works fine
wish it had a little more high end response
but for the money it works greati was so very impressed by the raving reports
but hearing is believing
physically well built
mediocre sound
no comparison with a yamaha half its size
no transparency hallow colored sound mediocre imaging
bass booms at port resonance can be cured by plugging the port with an old sock but loose bass response
not flat response
good and tight mid and high range
you can get better sound for less if you go to a  yamaha product
all together not bad
good try but no cigari bought three pairs of these recently because the price was low enough to give them a try and i have had other bics before and many were actually pretty good for lowends
i wanted larger ones for my garage for more range
the first two pair i bought did not have the si on the model number on the back
just dv
the veneer on these is absolutely horrible to say the least
does not look like wood and is very thin and badly glued on
the veneer is pealling all over because they were not put one very well and the seams or off
construction of the box is not great either
i then picked up a pair on ebay for  total as parts to replace a bad tweeter on one of mine
those did have si on the back and had different grills and much better realistic veneers
boxes appear to be assembled better as well
i believe these are older models but certainly superior
i just swapped out the drivers and crossovers and they work great
definitely no where near high or even midlevel speakers but good enough for a garage or second system
i added more damping material and they sound great
ported so puts out enough bass and the tweeter puts out nice highs
screw down binding posts as well
the driver has weak magnet support so if they are dropped you have a good chance of losing the driver
just make sure the si is on the model number on the back label and dont spend more than  for good used ones
i would write it off as just on bad pair but i had two pair like this
to me it means bic cheaped out on quality of the box
speakers were identical
all of them were made in chinai received the pair of dvsi speakers this afternoon and promptly hooked them up to my sound system
within a few minutes of listening and trying to place them correctly i noticed a vibration sound from from one of them
i took off the grille and sure enough one of the  woofers was sounding slightly blown making almost a hissing and scratching sound
im giving  stars because the one speaker that is working properly is starting to sound really good
im about  hours into breaking them in and its starting to warm up
i have setup an exchange through amazon so im looking forward to getting the new pair
ill update my review after the new pair arrives
im expecting my dv rears tomorrow as welllistened to these for a few days with a hk and vintage marantz  tried them on stands no stands etc
mediocre sound at best
my paradigm titans v sound much more natural and open
much better bass too
polk rti also sounds much better
but those speakers cost  times as much
build quality seems good
nothing wrong with these speakers
but theres nothing awesome about them either
i think youd be better off spending a little more to get entry level infinity primus speakers
or go even cheaper and get the dayton bookshelf speakers for less than half the price of the bic speakerslike many inexpensive splitters this offers a balanced inductive circuit inside that dc couples thru all ports i actually tore it open and inspected it
it offers no dc blocking in either direction to any port i had to install my own for my application
it seemed well made otherwisewe installed this outside on our antenna to keep the wires as short as possible to get a good signal
i am not sure if this is supposed to be water proof or resistant but the rain killed it
maybe we are dumb but if it is supposed to go on an antenna outside shouldnt it be able to handle weatherdespite a higher quality feelweight than the ideal satant diplexer i purchased from lowes this item did not perform as well
it successfully combined two antennae but did not boost overall signal strength as i hoped
as with most antenna issues your situation may produce different results
its worth a shotthis item work well  at about the same as any brands on the market at about the same costworks for what i used it for
input one line to two different units
worked for me and hope it works for youworked fine with the digital antenna but mostly static with dish network
not worth the cost to pay for return postageproduct and delivery is outstandsing
very good price
allows you to combine your cable and  other video inputs dvd etc into a single cable output where each of the video inputs are placed on a separate cable channel
if you have a dish box with  video outputs the channel plus will place them onto a single tv cable output on two separate channelsok after  or  years im now looking for a box that acts like the but need to get with the timeshdmi inputsand whats with the mono audio
these boxes should transmit stereo and hdmi inputs
i also wish there were another rf input allowed
why
because id like to add local tv antenna to be put in the same input baseband as cable tvright now im using the  to add my dish via composite input to  to my  how about components video inputs
it shouldnt cost that much more
all these electronic techniques are a few decades old and i imagine a small chip should be able to do itmaybe double the costone added notemy first  popped a capacitor which i changed out
take a closer look  at your design  pleasei bought this product so i could watch my dvd player on all  of my house tvs
i have a roof mounted antenna from which i get my locals
no cable no satellite
my antenna is a powered type but when i use it powered i get severe interference in my two modulated channels
when i turn the power supply off on my powered antenna the interference clears up and the picture is great
however without a powered antenna i loose two of my channels because they are pretty far awaythen if that is not bad enough the unit itself looses some gain on the antenna signal as it passes through it
so i was loosing two more channels there
bringing my total number of channels i can no longer get to  when you have an antenna only you do not want to loose any channels
also one of the distant tv outputs produces an annoying popzap sound on the tv that is hooked to it every  seconds
like the sound of static that your clothes make in the winter time when the air is dryi am still trying to narrow down the cause of that but im guessing its probably not the tvim just very disappointed after reading all the hypeoh and the biggest annoyance i have sent questions to  linear corp via email and get no responseit seems and im no electrician that someone taped an adapter to the bottom of an antenna
in a better way than i could think of off hand
kinda reminds me of an old field radio antenna
i have not had the chance to use it but it came and plugs in easily enoughcant get much range out of this guy although i wasnt expecting much
i do feel like it could work a bit better than it does thoughi bought this mic a few years ago to be used on my low cost cobra  wxst iii use my cb for when i off road my toyota tacoma with the ttora membersthe sound is great according to the people that are listeningfits great in my handthe only reason i only gave it stars is the heat shrink that is near the connector dry rotted and split open to expose the wiring belownow i need to disassemble dissolder and add new head shrinkother than that a great microphone and excellent priceupdate  october  it has been over  yearsthe mic still functions great but the rubber sheathing for the wiring is dry rottingfirst was at the connection now at the coil sectionnot happy going to contact cobra to see if they will do anythingwhich i doubt because its been a long time since i bought ittime to look for something differenta user guide was not provided
plug this into my music device to full volume the speaker did not amplify the volume
there is no volume control on the speaker so you are pretty much stuckhave had this speaker for about  years and it still works
its very easy to install
it is louder than my cb speaker but the speaker quality could be betteras a stock radio without all the mods it does a fair to poor job at best
unless your going to spring more money to have this radio peaked and tuned dont waist your money
i would go with a galaxy dx or dx
i bought this radio as a backup and am going to have it upgraded eventuallyworks ok except for the problem with the squelch that bleeds thru and is very annoying
seem to me they should have fixed that by now
i have been given instructions off the internet that would have me cut wires and resolder some
i think that kind of repair should be done by the manufacturer either during manufacture or after for freei bought this radio to simply see what was available on shortwave broadcasts the reception is decent if you are holding it and do not have any electronic interference around but overall it showed me i want to buy a better quality short wave radio in the near futureif you want to see if you like short wave radio give this unit a try if you already do and want a replacement spend a little more and get a better devicethis radio is okay
just okay
okay
lol
i love radio
i love listening to radio as well as collecting shortwave radios
i am especially fond of old fashioned analog radios
digital radios just do not do it for this baby boomer
that being said this radio worked well right out of the box
reception and build quality are average but you really cant complain about anything especially for this priceok  isnt much to pay for a radio so i guess i shouldnt be too picky but i wouldnt recommend this onei compared it to the much smallerkaito wrx amfm shortwave radio bluefor writing the review although the latter does cost twice as muchthis coby is bigger than the average small portable but despite its size mine has a tendency to fall over backwards
the switches are good enough but the tuning is stiff
i listened to the coby and the kaito side byside and the kaito had was sharp and clear compared the the distinctly muddy sound of the cobyam reception was a disaster with whistles all over the band
the kaito was very good on am
i didnt have problems with fm but the kaito pulled in more stationsfor shortwave the dial calibration was really bad
one station that was at  khz appeared at about  or about half way across the dial
it wasnt an image because nothing was at 
i would say use this for a disaster radio but that stiff tuning worries me with doubts that it might faildue to the recessed tuning dial and the dim gray color light gray numbers on medium gray background this radio is very hard to see except in strong direct light while the kaito is easy to read
the one plus the coby has is a clear visual indication of which band is selectedthe coby tunes longwave which is unusual but i couldnt get any stations
i can with other radios the kaito doesnt tune lwone nice thing i can say is that the battery door is hinged and youre not likely to lose itif you ask my advice pay an extra  and get the kaito
if youre rally stuck at  get thecoby cxcb  band amfm shortwave radiowhich at least has digital tuning readout and works ok on fm and shortwave am not so muchfor  the coby cxcb is only ok the am band suffers from bad station bleed especially between stations but the majority of stations i got came in fine though one i listen to couldnt really be heard due to bleed
fm performance is much better and quite good given the radios price
the longwave band didnt pick up anything aside from bleed from another band but it isnt really used in the us as far as i understand
im a shortwave novice and im not sure how to judge the performance of the shortwave bands
outdoors in the middle of the day with the antenna fully extended i was able to pick up a few stations on the shortwave band clearly mostly religious onesas for the unit and its accessories the included earbuds are okay and are more enjoyable to use than the speaker
it can be tough to see which band youre on in low lighting because the yellow background that appears behind the transparent number of the band youre on is too far behind said number to be clearly visible
the tuning bar is off on the am band by about  khz
the fm tuning bar seems accurate
i have no idea if the shortwave tuning is accurate but one station i recognized showed up correctly so i have a hunch that it is
the unit can run on both battery power and with a v adapter
i wasnt able to test it out with an adapter because quite frankly i have no idea where to get one
finally build quality feels pretty good for a cheapo radio but the tuning dial should have been designed to stick out more to make it easier to turn you can only turn it little by littledespite these issues for  it is worth it both as an interesting item and as a decent fm radioi bought this band radio and it works great in the us and in latin america but unfortunately it does not work in europei bought two of these from soulgood via amazon marketplace in used  very good condition
the cost was  each as opposed to the new price of the used  very good was a broken tab on the battery door of one and some small scratches on the corner of the other
nothing to worry aboutthe coby cb measures  long  tall and  thick
its a tad big for a shirt pocket but fits a bdu or jacket pocket
the overall feel of the radio is fine  its a  plastic radio and it feels like it
its not flimsy but it doesnt yell sturdy either
the entire radio  except for the display  is grey
it requires two aa batteries which are not included
using rayovac alkalines i got about  hours of use in my testing
the batteries go in endtoend and the battery door is just a snaptoclose piece of plastic
it is held on the radio via two small plastic tabsthe left side of the radio has the headphone jack and the power adapter port
the headphone jack is a standard mm jack and it does put sound out through both ear pieces
the power adapter is made for a dc  volt center pin connector
you can find them at radio shack for around  if youre interested or you may have one laying around from an old cell phonethe  speaker is on the front left side
it sounds okay but is a little tinnyalso on the front is the display
the casing shows the shortwave bands fm am and lw listed at the top and mhz and khz at the bottom
the tuned indicator shows a red led when the radio is tuned into a strong station
the power indicator is a yellow piece of painted plastic thats attached to the on  off switch right below it and it just turns yellow when the radio is switched to the on position whether there are batteries in it or not
the band selector and on  off switch are right under the display
the band selector is just what it says
it slides sidetoside to switch between bands with another painted yellow mark to show through the top to show what band youre on
the slider moves easily and stops at each station nicely
the bands are shortwave  through  fm am and lw
the numbers are visible through the screen but barely
the dark grey  black background mixes in with the faded white numbersthe right side of the cb has the tuning and volume knobs
i like the knobs theyre actual knobs not just dials found on most inexpensive radios
the tuning knob is on top and controls the tuning indicated by a stainless wire thats between the numbers and plastic window
finetuning is very easy
the volume knob works just as easily and needs no further explanation
the top of the radio is where the antenna is
it rotates out from the left side and is  when fully extended
it swivels too
however its one of the most flimsy antennas ive seen on a radio and i highly encourage you to use it only when necessarythe back has the typical stand a piece of plastic that moves to make the viewing angle easier when at a table
it has all of the bandlengths listed as well as a world map with the regions numberedin terms of performance the cb is just okay
fm comes in as good as any other radio of this size
am is a bit tricky at times
ive had the fm drift every now and then but not am
the shortwave  the reason i got this radio  is good
compared to other inexpensive  and under shortwave radios ive used i give it a  out of  for shortwave receptionearphones are also included
theyre hard in stereo and they work
theres not much else to say about them expect what youd find at big lots for three bucksin general this is a good starter radio or a gift for the new shortwave user
if youre into shortwave as a hobby you might think of this as a dollar store shortwave radio
for me  a newcomer who doesnt want to spend more than  on a radio  its adequatethis produce fell a little below expectations
it has not held up well but for the price it is okay
shipped quickly but was smaller than i thought and didnt realize it was battery operatedbut yes it is okfoe emergency in power outages or outside in my forrest work pretty good
on short vawe bands in evening i can hear signals all over the worldi bought this solely for use at the gym
like a lot of gyms the televisions in my gym have their audio set to run through fm radios so i needed a portable radio if i wanted to be able to pass the time watching tv while doing my time on the cardio equipment
the audio quality is fine
definitely not spectacular but what can anyone expect for less than ten bucks
my only complaint about this is that it has an analog dial with tiny little numbers that are nearly impossible to read
its also a little bulkier than i thought it would be but its very lightsometimes opened and the ribbon would be stuck inside
worked ok especially since this is the only product of its kind out there
bought for the cleaner part  was a gift to my father
he wasnt impressed but it works for what we got it fori originally had a vhs cassette cleaner from a company called geneva which was an excellent cleaner i was  satistfied with it
this geneva cleaner cleaned in a wet mode using alcohol and left all my videos squeaky clean
the kinyo cleaner is not nearly as good cleaning vhs cassettes and im sure its because it works on a dry mode
it has also broken some of my old vhs tapes and ive had to open them and taped the ends together again
for its value the kinyo cleanser is a good one but you should be taking a good look at it so you can stop it before it reaches the end otherwise it will break the tape at the endthis like other vcr rewinders i have ordered has fallen a little bit short
i have an old one also and it works better than this one
the problem is staying closed while it rewinds none of my older ones have ever done thatyou can find batteried for a little less but the lenmar have always treated me well and not given any firmware nagging like some other generics can
does not have the full mah capacity more like  but still decentupdate  october  these batteries are still going strong
i am very pleased and plan to buy another one as the battery life is still very high and they are seeing use on a weekly basispurchased two dlc batteries from adorama via amazon and two lic lenmark batteries from mee  i bought these to use in my new flashpoint grip on my canon d this set up is used to shoot my daughters competitive cheerleading eventsone of the dlc batteries was defective from the start it appeared to charge but in reality did not accept a charge
adorama promptly refunded me for the defective unit excellent customer servicethe other dlc  worked fine and is in my camera now
i am very pleased with its performance
the dlc seems to focus the camera slightly faster than the lic but this could just be a perception on my part
overall i am happy with all three batteries that work and yes disappointed in the one that did notbattery life seems highly acceptable  i have no complaints
will i buy these again
yes i can buy three of these for the price of one canon batterynot lenmar batteriesi purchased additional batteries thinking that i was ordering lenmar batteriesnot
they are some no name chinese knockoff
cannot qualify the quantity but the vendor blames amazon for using the lenmar description and take no responsibility for that descriptionwill update this in a couple weeks once ive given the batteries a workoutthese ear buds do the job adequately
they dont fit my ears as well as ipod ones but you get what you pay fori needed a pair of earphones for my netbook and these fit the bill perfectly
not a big expense if they get misplacedwork fine for the intended purposethere are many many other earphones that are better if your main use is music but for my purposes these are hi fi compared to the builtin netbook speakers and i dont have to worry about losing thembtw their musicality isnt bad  much better than the no name ear buds on sale at mbk mah boon krang in thailand for example and really not much worse than stock apple earbudsthese are the cheapest decent brand name earphones ive foundwas a little upset about these but very nice sound quality guess they better than nothing  for the price i paidmy husband suffers from some kind of mysterious broken headphone curse so ive become somewhat of an expert in comparing brands
the sound quality this set of ear buds provides is not excellent but its slightly better than average for ear buds within its price range
the sound range is better than average but dont expect a super clean sound or deep bass
the buds are comfortable to wear
one drawback however is the unusually short cord which can be annoying if youre using them at the computer or if youre a tall person with your ipod in your pocket
to make matters worse the rubbery cord tends to naturally crinkle up making itself even shorter
all in all for a set of cheap ear buds this is not a bad buythe sound isnt great the fit isnt great they get sweaty and gross
those are the good qualitiesseriously though they do what they are supposed to do
you can run and wear a baseball cap at the same time
that has to count for something rightthe molding on these is very poor with lots of flash around the ear thus requiring some sanding to correct the situation the arm is also very close to the top of the earpiece so they squeeze and make the ear uncomfortable after about  minutesi cant stand ear plug type headphoneseither they hurt or they dont stay in
this is a good basic set of headphones
they are not acoustically great but good enough for audio books or listening to some music while exercising and they stay on your earsobviously they are cheap but i didnt expect them to be quite so small
they do not appear to be designed for an adults head
i wear them anyway but they are way too snug  mostly because im too cheap to replace them until they wear outthat said cant beat the priceit was okthe buds are too big for me and theres no tension when placed in the ears to help stay in place always having to push them in my ear to comfortable
they sound goodbut just dont stay in the ear very wellto get around the pain caused by them pinching into my ease too aggressively i put them over a book to stretch the two earpieces apart
after a day they had loosened up wellmy problem though is that my ear canals are narrow and the earphones could not find the right spot to get good sound on the left side unless i held them in the right place
if they dont fit you right you can always return them to amazonthese things are okay to sit around and listen to alone but while youre active these things will fall apart
first the cushions on the buds will fall off and vanish forever and if you have a big head like i do they will fall from their band causing frequent reattachment
if youre looking cheap then try them out but otherwise you should look elsewherethis was supposed to be a  star review btwedit one of the speakers died yesterday so i tossed them in the trash
with that the search for the perfect headphones continuesi love the lightweight headphones that go over your head and into your ears
but i wish these headphones had a little better sound
it seemed as though i had to turn the volume up more to listen thru them
i would not buy this particular headphone againthey work but i have no idea what i was thinking when i bought these
ear buds do just as good job as theseive purchased a lot of cable recently including svideo component video and optical cable
i purchased this short cable to run data from my progressive scan dvd player to my denon  and to be perfectly honest the stuff sears sells in their audiovideo department works just as well as monster and costs quite a bit less
mind you im not antimonster heck my house is filled with s of feet of gauge monster thx cable
but you can get really good cable for a lot less if you look around
try ebay for startersi was using bottom of the line  foot cords for all my connections i figured having a shorter cable made of gold would make the picture even better than it was there was absolutely no quality improvement by switching to these i have great eye sight as well both my roommates agree with me as well these are great if you want short easily manageable cords but not worth the money if it is just for quality improvementsthe price isnt amazing its not a rip off either thoughthey function just as they should
therefore just okaydv tapes are ok if you need them but they are becoming obsolete
i bought a camcorder that records in sd  gb bytes
money well spent for the next few yearsi tried on my camcorder and it didnt work
i gave a  star rating because it may not be the tapes and it could be the camcorderantenna pretty flimsyits clear to me that people love to rave about this radio
for  its hard to complain too much about what it offers
the physical construction seems sturdy enough and sony even throws in a pair of inexpensive headphones that are fine for am talk radio type listeningpros audio seems tailored to talk radio with a prominent midrange  good vocal clarity  lacking in bass small and lightweight  the sort of pocket radio you can actually put in your shirt pocket
 agc automatic gain control is fantastic  on fading am signals this unit handled them very nicely
 selectivity is good  tighter than most other cheap radios with less slop from nearby channelscons the analog dial was way off on calibration reading about  khz too high on am unfixable
 this radio is extremely hard to tune  takes a swiss watch makers hand to tune the tiny thumbwheel its impossible to overlook the fact that not having digital frequency readout is a huge minus
 fm signal and audio quality was just ok nothing speciali also have the slightly more expensive sony srfmw portable amfm radio
its a bit smaller in height and width but larger in depth dimension and is heavier
it is pocketable but the weight is noticeable
it is extremely well built and goes for about   only  more than the srf
for that slight extra bit of money you get digital frequency readout better bass a clock and the weather band
it sounds much better on fm even when compared to the srf using the srfs headphones
you also get a much better pair of sony headphones thrown in with the deal
yeah the am selectivity is not quite as good as the cheaper srf and the agc is close to the performance of the srf but not quite as good
however i have to say that i much prefer the srfmw with its digital frequency readout and solid very study design
the poor calibration on the analog dial of the cheaper srf and the inability to have any idea of the exact frequency you are on are dealbreakers for me
tuning the srf with the small thumbwheel is also an exercise in frustrationone last thing  for some reason i found the cheaper srf got less performance boost than the sony srfmw when using an am signal boosting loop antenna kaito an
that surprised me and im not sure why that was the situationthis radio seems to be stuck in the s technically
and it operates that way
it does what i wanted it for listening to the noon news at work
but it is not a pleasent experiencethe reception is not very good i need to place the radio exactly right to minimize the humming in the headphonesand if it is bumped or shifted slightly the background noise drowns out the stationalso tuning in stations is very difficult
the tuner is set for coarse tuning there is no way to do any fine tuningin summary it is a basic radio and not much morethis radio does not hold the station and its hard to dial in precisely too
i end up spending a lot of time nudging the dial back and forth to get on the station
i also get a lot of static and high pitched squealing compared to other portable radios ive owned
ive only had it for about a month and its just too frustrating to take on a walk
im back now upgrading to a better radio
i shouldnt have been so cheap the first go aroundi bought this radio so i could listen to my favorite hotheaded am political radio shows on the way to work while i was experimenting with a combination of walking and riding the bus
as long as you have one favorite station you are fine
tuning is very sensitive and youve got to get a feel for the analogue tuning dialthe stations come in clear but so does the interference from street lights power sources etc
that one is continually exposed to in a city environment
maybe ill listen to it while doing yard work at home
this is the kind of ratio you take for a walk in your small town or kick back on the deck and listen to with the headphones so you dont disturb others
its a cute and functional radio for the money but it didnt work for what i intended to use it fori bought this for the cassette but it didnt come wit hone
i didnt read as carefully as i should have but i am a dinosaur  used to want a walkman when they first came out in the s
now i have a walkman  one day i shall listen to them as i used to want to do in high schooli bought this radio to use while doing outdoor chores so i was looking for something relatively light
in its favor this sony walkman is fairly light and the clip holds it fairly securely
of course what is important for a radio is its ability to get stations and play sound
in terms of getting stations i could never get a solid lock on the local npr station 
i could clearly pick up another station before the npr station and could equally clearly get the same station after the npr station
when i could get the npr station static was a problem
also when i moved to pull weeds for example i would lose the npr station and the other station would come in crystal clear
to be fair this might be a problem with the stationalthough it does come in perfectly on my trucks radioin contrast to the npr station the radio picked up other stations very well and had excellent sound quality for a radio in this price range
as such if the stations you want are ones that it can lock onto you will find this a good radiothe plastic shell of the radio is the usual cheap plastic that looks fairly fragile
i have not drop tested it but would not expect it to stand up to too much abusebut of course it is a lower priced radiothe headphones do produced decent sound but they fell off fairly regularly when i tried to use them
i was working outside and so was sweaty and moving around quite a bit
switching to better headphones solved that problemthe walkman worked great but the headphones died after one week
i replaced the headphones and my grandson can still enjoy his musicoverall the radio was okay i got this to listen with on the train during my commute
fidgeting with the analog dial was just too miserable for me in the city radio stations are so close together that just a slight tweak on the dial can put you annoyingly and loudly in between stations
its not exactly the radios fault but in any case it didnt work out for me
i went with a digital tuner and never looked backi purchased this walkman to listen to talk radio and some music while i putz around or workout
dont bother with this sony if you plan on moving around
i lost reception even on the better channels every time i moved
what good is thatim returning itnote  it may be just the area i live in but my other largerradios bring in the channels why doesnt this onedid not have good reception with this radio in the buidling where i work
it may do well in other locationsthe reception is not too stable some channels are too much noise at different areas at homebut when considering its p  v ratio it is acceptableits a basic radio with manual tuning reception is nothing to die for but it does come handy outdoors if you dont want to carry cellphone for training and running purposesthis radio is okay  it works and the sound is pretty good at times  but there are several problems
a it seems rather large for what it is  that is it seems like there is a lot of empty space inside the cheap plastic exterior b it feels far less sturdy than it looks c the belt clip is a very cheap plastic thing that looks like it could snap off with the lightest force and d most importantly the volume is louder in the right ear than the left
i thought the included headphones were simply defective but i tried them with my nice headphones and i had the same problemit really is true you get what you pay for
i am returning this and paying a bit more for a better constructed modelthe fm tuning is difficult
it also picks up electrical noise from exercise machines at the gym where i use iti bought my first srf a couple of months ago and i really enjoyed it for what it is  a lightweight nofrills radio with great am and decent fm reception
unfortunately my unit started to sound scratchy during am tuning which i attribute to the faulty variable capacitor
since the radio is so cheap theres no point of fixing it so i bought another one
the new radio has no problems with am tuning but the beginning of fm band is useless as the one strong station  mhz  kqed kills reception for all other stations until approximately  mhz  you keep tuning for a quarter of the dial and its still kqed
my previous srf didnt have the same problem so theres something else that was left out during quality controli purchased this radio to replace my old sony walkman circa s
i use it when i walk for exercise
the station i listen to is about  miles away
i comes in ok but sometimes fades momentarily
it works for what i use it for
there may be better performers or better values out there but im pretty much satisfiedi bought this walkman because of all of the glowing reviews particularly around am reception
i have found all of that overhyped
the am reception is much worse than my more expensive walkman with a digital tuner
i live in appleton wi and regularly try to listen to am in chicago i am a white sox fan
this radio is useless for that task
dont expect more than what you pay forcontrary to the product description there is no headphone jack on the unit
only reason i bought it decided to keep it and solve my headphone jack requirement in a different fashioncan you use it with tripods meaning is there a socket on the bottom of that screw to take standard tripod  boltbearing in mind the price ie
cheap i thought long and hard about how many stars to give this and settled on three
it could easily have been four or five but for three problems i had with it
you may not have the same problemstheyre cheap they do what theyre supposed to do which is let you screw the base on to your camera kind of see below
solid plastic so theyll likely last a very long timemy setup i bought this so i could add a quick releaseconnect to my macro slider rails primarily for convenience
this item does let me add quick releaseconnect to that situation but it does not do so conveniently
for it to be convenient i would need to have one of these on my tripod and on my macro slider rails and on anything else i planned to use it on so i could leave the camera piece attachedthe reason for this is that there is no way of tightening the main screw on to your camera or glass by hand there is no mini handle on the boltscrew underneath the plate to attach to a camera
you either need a thin coin or better a screwdriver
for me thats a problem
i dont want to carry a screwdriver or a dime just to take this thing off my camerathe second thing i did not like about it was that the plate that attaches to your camera is very small and the mechanism for locking it in place feels finicky and very tight
maybe with time i will get used to itthe third thing i didnt like is that the pin on the plate far side of camera bolt in picture is not spring loaded
so to attach it to my camera i have to actually take that pin out
which you guessed it you need a screw driver fori can see this working for someone who wants to just attach it for a single cameratripod setup or for someone who plans on buying lots of them for every application they have or doesnt mind carrying around a screw driveri wont be buying more of theseordered the sima quick connect over a month ago together with a canon monopod   both were listed as in stock at the time of order
the sima was recommended for use with the monopod
sima quick connect arrived within days
excellent
the canon monopod  was listed for shipment over a range from    days in the future  and was eventually explained as sold out
im still waiting for the canon monopod with no current delivery date in sighthope to receive the monopod soon will update this post when it arrives and i can test the sima quick connecti purchased two of these sima quick connect units several weeks ago
i have used them with both a nikon d and a nikon d slr and with several different lenses and on two different tripods
they are ok if you are using a small light lens like a prime mm or mm
but im not comfortable using the sima with larger and heavier telephoto lenses
why
the surface area of the insert that connects to the camera is too small
its all plastic
better and more expensive mounts such as manfrotto are metal
there is no additional safety lock pin to prevent accidental release
its relatively inconvenient
one must use a screw driver or thin coin a dime works to tighten the unit to the camera tripod mountunfortunately it is with the telephoto lenses that tripods are most necessary
so ive coughed up the significant extra money to convert to manfrottomanfrotto  rc rapid connect adapter with pl quick release plate  replaces  blackif you plan to use the sima quick connect with a small compact camera you will probably be very happy with the product
its certainly a lot cheaper than most of the alternativesreally too clunky and troublesome 
eif you really do a lot of swapping on and off the tripod this is handy
from a quality standpoint its very good
however the design lends itself to being substantially less than rock solidthis is a decent product that works well with my tripod and nikon d camera
it screws down tightly to the tripod and the plate attaches tightly and securely to my camera
i really like this productit is plastic but i didnt find it smelly as did one star reviewer
of course i didnt stuff it up my nose to test it either
the plastic appears to be high quality and the entire unit seems to  be strong and well made
there is however a problem and thats the reason ive rated it threestar rather than fiveit seems that additional quick attachment plates shoes are not available anywhere
i have multiple cameras lights etc that i use on my tripods and id like to put quick attachment plates for this mount on all of them
i have searched amazon ebay and multiple sites on the web and they just dont seem to be available
i cannot conceive that sima would manufacture a product like this without having additional plates available
it appears that most of the other manufacturers do have additional plates available for their mounts but they are considerably more expensive
i suspect that what may be going on here is that sima does in fact have additional plates available in their product line but none of the distributors stock them preferring instead to sell the entire complete unit because the price for the sima complete unit is about the same as others charge for the plate alone with  one lowerpriced exception that i could findthere is a giotto attachment plate at less than  which appears to be just a tiny bit smaller than the sima and it may fit
i plan to order it
i will post an update to this review after ive tried it
the only other option is to buy enough sima complete units to cover all of my cameras which to me seems to be a waste of money and a wasteful use of what i think is a pretty good product
based on the cost of the entire unit the sima attachment plate should cost between  and  which i would consider a reasonable price for a teeny piece of plasticsome have complained that the sima will not support heavy telephoto lenses
i use my nikon d with a sigma mm reflector telephoto lens and dont feel there is a problem with the pound weight
of course the telephoto lens rather than the camera attaches to the tripod in this configuration which balances the weight securelyin my opinion this is a fivestar product which is diminished because additional attachment plates are not available
if the giotto attachment plate does not work i likely will upgrade to a more expensive unit for which i can buy additional attachment plates
and thats sad because the sima unit works for meupdate the giotto attachment plate is too large to fit the sima base
its almost identical to the sima except for its size
too bad it wont workanything but quick
somewhat cumbersome to take on and off
decent quality
does not fit as secure as one would want
you get what you pay forthis quick release accessory is ok  for the cost it was what i expected and meets by needs although i do feel it will not last long and i will need to replace it
the biggest complaint i have is that when connected there is a slight shake causing the effectiveness of the monotripod to be reduced
it is easy to use though and inexpensivei liked the idea of using this on my monopod for a quick release
the only issue i had was with the rubber around the screw
when i would tighten the little plate to my camera this rubber would start moving and shifting eventually keeping it a little lose to the point i stopped using it because it wouldnt tighten well on my camera
its a great idea but couldve been built betterwith a very sensitive sensor and image stabilization my nikon coolpix s can take amazing long telephoto photos handheld
the problem is it is hard to compose at such a long zoom or even to confirm that the camera is focusing on your subject
solution a marvelous monopodnorazza monopodlightweight tdwhich weighs almost nothing and collapses to 
i wanted the sima qc to use with the s and the monopodthe sima qc is lessthanideal for my purposes because you have to remove the camcorder pin with a screw driverno problem but it will then almost certainly get lost
a better design would be to allow it to retract on a spring or fold away you have to attach the camera plate to your camera with a very thin sharp screwdriver even a dime is too thick
a better design would have allowed the screw to be tightened with a penny or a dime the camera plate is   square
attached to my camera it will not fit in my camera casenikon coolpix s series black leather horizontal case for s and s the tripod adapter piece is relatively enormous   acrossnot a huge problem with my camera but with other small cameras it could get in the way of looking through the viewfinderminor gripes the locklever actually opens a little too far in which case it actually gets in the way of removinginstalling the camera plate if i was using a bigger camera i would be concerned that the camera screw is offset to the edge of the camera plate the leverage of a heavy camera could easily snap the camera plate in half
the camera plate is only a square of plasticwhy cant sima provide a noncamcorder plate with the screw centered and no camcorder pin in addition to the camcorder platehoweverid love a miniversion half the size of this one particularly built into a miniball head similar toprofessional mini ball head camera mountrecently i purchased a sima  led light for the same price that lasts  hour on a charge
i no longer carry this with me unless the sima isnt charged
this light gives a nicer color but if you want something that lasts all day at a wedding chose the sima lighti love to film my travel adventures and find it necessary to utilize a camera light especially in dark areas ie caves or more generally at night time
its very bright and powerful but the downside to it is that it only lasts about  minutes on a full charge
the power of the light drains the battery like crazy
so whatever you need to film you better do it quickpros  its a monopod and its affordableits tallcons  a few too many for methe mounting is very loose unless you tighten it with a cointhe only way to tighten it is with a coin
youll break a fingernail trying to do that thing
my tripod has an easy screwits much too bigthat little foot is absolutely uselssthats about it
its ok but id keep shopping
get something smaller and better madei bought this unit to use w a d extra battery case and a  prime lense the unit is well put together but cant handle the weightespecially the link between the detachable base and the pod its plastic and will rock  back and forth w the heavy lensecamera combo  would be great for a lighter applicationthe price of this unit was astronomical
its nothing special
doesnt even have an lcdled screen to tell you what its doing so if youre using firewire and not an old school composite connection you have no menus or counter or on screen info
i had to have it though because my  digital camera wouldnt play  of my tapes audio track just dropped
 but this player played everything perfectly so that i was able to digitize the tapesnote this player uses the original dv spec
this means the audio and video tracks are not synced digitally as they are transferred to your computer
the initial dv files will look fine but if you try to cutsplicereorganize the one huge original file into smaller dated clips the longer the clip is the more the audio and video are out of sync by the end
its a flaw in the dv spec now remedied in newer versions of the formatsame exact mounts for  a pair from good ole monoprice put  in search box
amazon you still rock thoughyou wont be disappointed by the quality photos the hi will take
if youre still considering buying this camera consider other options as there are newer models
considering there are dozens of reviews on the product itself here are the weaknesses that ive experienced drains batteries
the hi uses  aa batteries
if youre going on a trip plan on bringing  extra rechargable batteries at least  mah and a battery charger
one set of batteries should last at least  shots without flash
do not use regular alkaline batteries as the camera will go through them quickly maybe  shots does not utilize highspeed cf cards
i purchased a lexar mb x cf card and did notice any increase in performance over the one included many digital cameras now have video capabilities
the hi records videos in quicktime mov format at a maximum length of  seconds
the videos come out grainymy sister told me right before my daughter was born you will want to take that camera and smash it into a wall
she was right
several times i have wanted to do just that
the lag time between each shot is just too long to capture those instant events
i have to take  to  shots to get my daughter smiling i am not kidding
little children and babies wont hold a smile or a pose for long
i have missed so many shotsit is depressing
also there is a pre flash or a flash indicator which alerts my daughter to close her eyesi am not a professionalso i really dont know what this accomplishesthe quality of the shots you do get is very good as far as detail and crispness go but they definately lack something in the color arena
if you use auto setting the flash captures the action very well but the color suffers
my photos look too grey and harsh
if you use the scene setting the flash and the colors are very true and natural but the picture comes out fuzzy no matter what you doeither you move a little or the subject does one mode is party and i would like to see the blurry fuzzy pictures of people dancing
if you dont use the flash in autoyou will also get slightly fuzzy pictures
i have spent hours color correcting my pictures and it is a lot of work
i would put up with it though if it would snap the darn pictures more quicklyalso the photo cap is just completely gimicky and unnecessary
my daughter continuously wants to grab at it when i am trying to take a picture
it dangles within her reach
it also has ruined several shots i took of her laying down and i was standing over her and i did not see it hanging in the viewbut in the image pic you see baby and right over her head a dark blobbattery life is very good
i can snap oodles of pics before charging
you can take clear detailed pictures up close if you use auto setting with the flash oni bought this camera with money my wife gave me for my birthday in  at the time i wanted a great digital camera that had the look and feel of a more expensive model but with really good imaging capabilities
i looked at every review for months
i poured over product manuals and would goto the camera store  times a week to hold different cameras to see what i liked
then i bought the  when i found an awesome deal
well i still like this camera very much
my wife uses it with as much ease as i do
but the last  years my biggest complaints are the batteries and the speedspeed maybe its the camera it takes so long to cycle between shots
its definitely not the camera for taking multiple shots or getting the one instant really great shotbatteries ive always groaned about anything that uses proprietary technology
this camera can use either  nikon liion rechargeable batteries or   time use cr batteries
finding a reliable source of crs is a pain in the butt
and paying  for a battery that lasts hrs is crap
the enels arent much better maybe the two i have are crap now but i hate that i can charge both batteries for  hrs and then get less than  shots each from a allegedly freshly charged batteryive always wished for a better zoom as well
x optical just doesnt cut it anymore
i never use digital zoom
i knew at one time there was a kit for adding a telephoto lens that was supposed to add an additional x zoom but i never could find the kit locally and in the end a x zoom didnt seem worth itover the years other things have happened to it
theres a slight blurriness on one side if the lens and the battery door no longer latches fully
ive went from mb cf card to a mb to a mb to a gb card
the gb card i got this last christmas is supposed to be a much faster speed card even though the camera is still just as slow as it wasits still a really good camera
it has some of the best images ive every taken
with amazing detail up close
with my tripod it will be used for studio type portraits or shots where i dont need speedmp has always been good for me
 of the time i never take photos that go over xs
and a good mp image is good enough size to enlarge without loss of detail to tabloid size printsi got a chance to play with this camera today
the picture quality seems up to nikons typical quality
the only thing that really lept out at me however was how slow the camera was
browsing through pictures can take up to  seconds a pop
deleting a picture takes literally minutes
ive never used such an outrageously slow digital camera in my life
it seems others have also had this problem
in addition the lens cap is a pain and the lens smashes into it if you forget to remove itnot good
nikons midrange seems to be lacking in the digital world but their highend stuff cannot be beat
there are better cameras than this one in the pointandshoot segmenti know one shouldnt expect much from inexpensive speakers but the sound is pretty poor even for the price
its nice that theres a bass and treble button and theres a headphone jack too
but the sound quality goes downhill fast if you put the volume past the midpoint
bass distorts the sound to the point that it isnt listenable
if youre looking for bass these arent the speakers you wantthe cases are cheapbut this is what i expected for the pricei left one in the car and the next time i got in my car the case looked like a burnt potato chipalsomore than a few of the cases were already broken when i received themi started to try and figure out a way to write to the supplier as it was not amazon but it was taking to long to figure out and it just didnt seem worth the hasslecheap cases at a cheap pricejust okive tried other slim cd cases  i find the tdk brand slim cd cases are higher qualitythe pros these cd slim cases are well made snap shut  stay closedthe cons expensive  the shipping is extra this may be specific to my order but there was shipping damage
several of the cases were unusable
this problem was with the packaging which was insufficient allowing the factory sealed package to flop around in the larger shipping boxi lowered the product rating for high cost  shipping damagenot a bad purchase
standard jewel case quality and clear colorless front covers
if only the packaging were better and the shipping and handling were more careful and better packed
upon opening the box there were a few of these jewel cases that had cracked and chipped badly clear and black plastic pieces falling everywhere
however the most of the cases did remain intact but at least  needed to be tossed
i would not purchase jewel cases from amazon again only due to the poor shipping and handling that breaks way too many of the cases
these cases can be found in local stores and there you can inspect the cases for breakagedoes what its meant to do 
however the cable is very stiff and combined with plug design sticks out quite a bit from the wall  would be better with a right angle plug
in addition the onoff switch is like a rocker and easy to nudge offfor the price this surge protector strip is a good value
works as intended
i would not put connect my home theater or computer system on it but for small items it does the job perfectly and can easily be hidden behind your furnituresgets the job done cheaply and with minimal space
i question the ability to handle a real surge but time will tellits decent and has a no frills plastic casing
the joule rating isnt that high for the price but is very acceptable
i actually like tripp lites isobar surge protectors with the metal housing but this one is much slimmer than thosenot much of a base sound and there are a lot of other brands out there for a lower price that i believe gives the same quality
still it is a good loudspeakerfirst i bought a nomad ii that uses smartmedia
it was a pain to constantly upload new music to it due to the limited storage
then i bought a sonic blue cd based mp player
it skips so bad its unusable
so i set out to decide between ipod and zen
i chose the zen because its much cheaper
i wont go on about all the great features except to say it works very well
everyone complains about the playcenter software but its not that bad
if you really hate it you can buy notmad explorer for  which is better i admithowever you should know about a few quirks it only has a  month warranty
no excuse for this
shame on creative
so figure in another  for an extended warranty the battery is not user replaceable and lithiumion batteries dont last forever
fact is it will need to be replaced in a couple years there is no stop button so you cant stop it from playing a song
very annoying the remote is not included
many places are selling it for  which i think is really expensive
i ordered it for  but its on backorder its a little larger than the ipod but not much instead of using a directory hiearchy it relies on the id tags which are often incorrect on downloaded music the included headphones are too tight and cant be adjustedsome things i really like the lcd is easy to read firewire transfer is very fast you can charge with the usb port great for the office the ac adapter is v so it works in europeoverall i like the zen but i feel creative took lots of shortcuts to get the price lower than the ipod
if you add some nice ear bud headphones extended warranty and remote control it still comes out to be cheaper but not that muchthis unit will not connect to a mac
creatives support states that future support for the mac is unlikely
therefore if you are a mac user looking for an alternative to the ipod look elsewhere
a pity because the zen is such a nice uniti havent been able to test this cam yet
it didnt dawn on me that my operating system wouldnt be backward enabled
the ad mentioned several operating systems this cam would work on but not windows  my systemthe camera does not connect to my computer
the usb wire that comes with the camera plugs into the camera well of course but the other end of the wire is almost square and cannot plug into my computers usb ports which are very rectangular holes
my computer is a very mainstream laptop pc by toshiba which i bought new in about aside on the positive side the hp photo  imaging software did install successfully to windows  even though only older versions of windows are listed on the cdromlet me first say that i usually like hp photosmart devices  cameras printers etc
this is my third photosmart camera
it has a number of pluses   an optical zoom that flows right into the digital zoom and with up to x you can really get close   an easytouse display menu  a viewfinder that adjusts to ones particular eye strengthon the negative side   it takes too long to take a picture after you press the shutter release it is  seconds before you can take another picture i do not know if this causes one to get blurry pictures but at the  megapixel size  mb for this camera and my hp  i had fewer blurry pictures with my hp  photosmart camera  you have to be within an inch of the viewfinder before it turns on you can have the view show on the large display but that uses more energy and you still dont see if it is focused right  it allows for several focus points but even after adjusting to a center one i still had some pictures where the background was in focus but my subject wasnti know that ill probably be in the minority of the reviewers but to sum it up if i had it all over to do again i wouldnt get this particular camera
about the same time as i got this camera i bought the hp photosmart  as a gift for my stepdaughter
while it doesnt have anywhere the zoom power of the  and only has  megapixels it also doesnt have the other problems with the  that i mentioned abovei have nothing against toshiba although theyve certainly laid a few eggs in the laptop market the last one being a line s that featured a desktop cpu piii that ran way too hot for the confined space of a laptop and resulted in numerous maddening shutdowns
anyway this one features a reasonably capable  ghz celeron chip as its pcu
these chips are a kind of quotintellitequot with rather limited graphics rendering capabilities
speaking of graphics the video card matches the celerons limited abilities offering only  megs of video ram
while the machine plays dvds and this is a nice feature of laptops one that can make long trips quite tolerable it does so with  disappointing aplomb though given its chip amp video card setup this is what one would expect
also irksome it has no usb  ports though it does have  usb  ports these are becoming a necessity for many new highspeed peripherals
my last issue with this computer is its weight at  pounds its quite an armful if youre carrying it too far
you might expect that kind of weight in a more capable desktop replacement machine but not in this roadonly unit
finally i would mention that the company handled the fiasco with the abovementioned overheating laptops rather poorly fixes under warranty were available but no blame was admitted and of course once the warranties are up those machines will likely become paperweights
however toshiba did discontinue the line but little good that will do for those who bought the bad apples in the first place
anyway i think the bottom line here is that there are better deals on better machines to be had and perhaps from better companies to booti bought this player recently to have a dependable durable digital audio player for working out or running
i was using a sony minidisc net md player for the task but was looking for something a little more weather and exercise resistant
i had to return the first psa  unit within a few days since it is pretty strict how you transfer music
i tried using a software other than the music match software which is a horrible product in my mind and the unit froze up
i replaced the unit and it worked decent as long as you follow the protocol to the t  problems with the player  no shuffle this is not good for working out since you sometimes want to mix things up no expansion capability the  mb is plenty of capacity for a work out but you get bored of  songs quickly and have to download more to the player no ability to just remove one or two songs from playlist in order to add more songs to replace others you have to erase the entire memory and reformat the playersurprisingly this is my first portable digital audio player
although i am an information technology professional and lifelong digital electronics enthusiast i have delayed purchasing a portable digital music player until they became affordable and i had a need for one
the nikephilips psa max is my first playeri decided on this unit because i have recently begun jogging as i train to run in my first marathon
for my long runs i needed a player that was light accessible and durable
i decided i want enough memory to store several full cds but without being as expensive as the players that store  or more gigs
this player fit my needs perfectlythe instruction manual leaves much to be desired but there is more detailed instructions available on the driver cd that comes with the item and also on the nikephilips website
the musicmatch software is limited version of a decent audio management application and allowed me to begin copying music to the player
i also found that microsoft media player  has support for this device but forces music copied to the player to be converted to microsofts wma file type
this is okay because the psa max also plays wma filesthe headphones that come with the player are very light and very comfortable as they sit securely over the ears and behind the head
however after my first run with these headphones the right side driver got damaged from a little sweat
these headphones are supposed to be designed for athletes so why did a small amount of sweat destroy them
i am very disappointed in this fact
my old sony sports headphones have stood up to hundreds of sweaty workouts without any problem and they still work
unfortunately my sony sports headphones may be light durable and sound great they are not as comfortable and snug fitting as the sweatdamaged nike philips onesanother problem i have is when i use ms media player  to copy music to the player the player locksup at the end of each song when the files it is playing are wma format at  kbps
i have to remove the battery to reset the player
there is no mention of this or any firmware updates on the nikephillips website
using the included musicmatch software to copy music to the player at  kbps does not cause this problem
because of this problem i am forced to use the musicmatch software instead of ms media player  although i prefer using media player and the final problem i have is that when i connect it to my computer just like i do with any usb device windows xp recognizes it and assigns it a drive letter
however after i disconnect the player the next time i connect it windows xp does not recognize it
i have to reboot my computer to have windows xp recognize it
i do not have this problem with other usb devices such as my digital camera pocket pc pda or memory card reader
and of course no driver update is available at the nikephilips web siteas for positives the audio quality is excellent
the features are simple and easy to use
the device is light and the armband position is ideal for jogging and working out
the headphones have a magnetic clip that is great for attaching the wires to the best positions on my clothing so they dont interfere with my movement
however i dont like having these very powerful magnets near my computer desk as the magnets could erase data on storage devices around my desk
i have diskettes media card zip disks etc
around my computer area that are sensitive to strong magnets
i have to disconnect my headset when i bring the player to my desk in order to copy music to it
this is very inconvenient
but since the headphones that came with my player dont work i no longer have this problem my sony sports headphones dont have the magnets and as a result their wires do get tangled when i am movingthe added rechargeable nimh battery and charger is a good bonus although two batteries instead of just one would be nice so that i would always have a charged battery available when the other needs to be recharged
a second rechargeable battery is recommendedthis itineration of the now venerable elph series was meant to be a half step up from the once very popular s model
the change here was to increase resolution from  megapixels to  megapixels
otherwise its features were much the same a slick looking steel body a proprietary battery amp charger a tootiny memory card and a x optical zoom and a not very useful x digital zoom
all of the canon models ive owned  have been durable and all of them take good picturesby now the  has been surpassed in most areas by cameras costing more or less the same amount of money
higher resolutions longer optical zooms faster image handling meaning less time btwn shots and better battery conservation are now commonplace
perhaps more devastating to the elan of these canons is the plain fact that their diminutive size appeal has been lost to cameras featuring all of the above advancements in packages that make the  seem like a leviathan the pentax optio amp minolta dimage being two good examplesif you already have an s or someone gives you one you have nothing to complain about
its a reliable and capable camera
however if youre about to invest in digital technology try one of the more advanced cameras mentioned abovei own a canon digital slr and bought this as a portable camera
after reading the reviews i expected that this camera would take good pics albeit not in the same league as my d
however to date i have found the pics grainy and lacking color detail
i have switched to manual and set the iso to   perhaps that will solve the problem
i suspect camera may be defective because no one else has suggested the pics are grainy
one other problemthe camera does not have a battery meter so you cannot tell when the battery needs recharging
this is a major design flaw
on a good notethe build quality is excellent
the camera is responsive although there is a lag with the pics and the buffer
i may wait for kyocera to perfect their ultracompacts because they have recently developed a chip that will load directly to the sd media and lag is not an issueif you have a small rack mounted environment with  or  cables and you wont need to rewire anytime soon then this is a decent system which works
if you have more cables have to rewire periodically need access to a particular cable every once in a while or will need to add a cable every once in a while this system is a bit of a pain to work with
it is difficult to track a cable and remove it once it is installed and the plastic fingers dont hold cables properly if you use all  slotsgreat camera but it installs entirely too much software before you can use it
most of my other pc cameras just plugandplay but this thing requires so many extra software packages and wants to install so much more that it can end up overwriting your existing instant messengers and other productsi though the whole point of usb was for plugandplay
all this device really consists of is a camera with a builtin microphone
logitech needs to borrow a page from the generic makers of the twinklecam and basically dont try to write their own softwaretoday you can get these in a twopack for less than sixty dollars
thats highly recommended but investigate other cameras that have builtin microphones like the twinklecam made by a few taiwanese makers and sold under many different brandsthe cyber acoustics lapel microphone is just ok for casual use
this is a handy mic that can connected to your monitor and used to make quick voice notes in video editing software or sound recorderthe sound quality is fairly poor but certainly usable for most applications that do not require hifi reproductionthis is an inexpensive mic and performs as suchthis is a low quality microphone also low cost
it works alright but just wont due for regular use or if the user needs any high quality sound picked up from it
i am currently using this microphone for skype for about  minutes daily and the person on the other end often has a difficult time hearing me if i dont speak very clearly directly into the microphone
if the microphone is  inches from my mouth forget about it  the volume drops off quickly
i will probably use this microphone for the next  months until i replace it with something for more regular use
i would only recommend this to someone who needs a microphone occasionally and does not need it for anything seriousthat said one feature for the casual user is a piece of plastic that comes with it that has doublesided tape on it for wall mounting which is the base of the plastic shown in the amazon picture see the customer images if you arent sure which part im talking about
this is a nice feature to keep the microphone out of the way when it isnt in use but within reach for the rare day its needed and it will be harder to lose
i have not tested the tape so i dont know if it works well or notnote the sound quality problem is not related to skype  my cheap skype phone that i was using previously had better sound quality it recently broke for no reason so i replaced it with this microphone
 update sept th  ive reverted to a  year old microphone that has no echo when im talking on skype
 update  ive been usingphilips voip  skype dual phone single handsetfor the last year for skype and it works great although it is now pricier than it used to bei have been unable to get this product to work with windows vista or xp
i tried to get drivers to support the product and therefore make it operational but so far no luck in finding driverstherefore i do not recommend this product until they have workable drivers for windows xp and vistai borrowed this device from my brother in order to format a sd card for a raspberry pi
so ive used this model for an afternoon with mac osx   no drivers are needed and the reader is quick both reading and writing
the issue with mixed reviews to my mind is because the reader supports older sd cards and mmc
for me that meant that none of my modern sd cards worked
thats because the new cards are sdhc or sdxc
so while the usb  is quick the unit only supports sdsc version of sd
if you are using a sd card with more than g capacity then this unit will not read it
some g cards work and others wont
sd cards g and under are typically sdsc and work well
i think something similar happens with the cf  there are  versions of the cf spec available
but i dont have sufficient cf cards on hand to work out what revision is supported by the reader
the iii printed on the reader refers to type i and type ii form factors not spec revisions i think
i had a few smart media cards on hand and tried them and found that they worked  but with just a few mb capacity i put them back in the drawerthe metal case is nice
the filters are ok but the eyepieces are overpriced and have poor eye relief
you just wont use the mm or mm eyepieces
my first telescope was a celestron se
i didnt know better back then and believed everything said by the manufacturer in their sales pitch
the reality is that celestron products are not top quality and are over priced
rather buy good quality eyepieces that you will actually use from other manufacturers
read as many objective reviews as possible and try to physically compare items before deciding what to purchase
i would really like to see a comparison chart of the real properties of optical components instead of the objective guesswork that tends to prevail
a poor quality eyepiece today will still be a poor quality eyepiece in ten years time
rather buy one really good eyepiece now and save up until you can afford to add another to your collection
this is stuff that your children can inherit or you can sell for the same price in future
you wont be able to give away the cheap quality partsthe kit here is basically meant to cater to new lowend telescope purchasers who know they need a set of eyepieces to use their scope but really have no idea what they needcertainly the feeling is that they just spent a ton of  on the scope and want a cheap set of eye pieces to get by until they know morefair enoughthe celestron kit here does a good job of thatexcept thata the eyepieces here are really horrible especially the smaller mm onesb the eyepieces have really bad specifications for eye relief the high end magnification lens are barely useable if you have good eyesuseless if you have poor or old onesc the other eyepieces degrade color and image quality so much that the children that most of these scopes are bought for might lose interest in astronomyd anyone who uses their scope for any significant amount of time will absolutely have to get at least  good eyepieces that will cost  eachthey are not going to be happy realizing how much  they wasted on this setso should this set be purchasedmaybe if you are buying it as a gift for someone who will not be using their scope much and who has amazingly healthy eyesfor everyone else a different set would be a better choicegreat kit with plenty of fun stuff to use
ive enjoyed the eyepieces and learning which diameter to usethe moon filter has been the most useful for night viewing here in phoenix especially with my tmount adapter
the barlow lens has been great as well
looking forward to finding a dark night sky somewherenow the negatives the case is nice feels cheap and wastes a lot of space
they only provide a small space for extra adapters
otherwise you will need to cut into the foamthere is that old saying you get what you pay for
the celestron accessory kit hits that mark right on the nose but in a very positive wayi can honestly say for the price point this little kit does very well
as one gains experience in this hobby they can fashion a greater understanding of what their needs are as their knowledge grows the celestron accessory kit acts as a beginers aid to an exspansive universe
if any given persons interests stick in this expensive hobby there will be plenty of time to by those ultra costly items until then this kit performs just finemy only gripe with this kit is the storage boxit is not exactly what those at celestron would have you believe
its sturdy and i have no doubt it will protect anything you may place in its innards my issue is that the material used are not all aluminum as stated
also do not be surprised if the storage foam inside doesnt look exactly like the picture on the boxall in all very happy with this purchase and would recommendsee ya around soundthese are a decent set of beginner  eyepieces filters and barlow
it give you a wide spread of size x power and fair quality
nice case and at an unbeatable price i paid  with free shipping
tomfirst things first this thing is huge
im used to carrying around the clien in the front pocket of my scrubs
great for quick and easy access however the clienx feels heavy and uncomfortablein addition to the size and weight the clamshell design which seems kind of cool at first and offers those grafitti illiterates a keyboard slows you down by hiding your quick buttonsanother negative is the cot
if you have any experience with handhelds you know that they just dont last so its hard to justify spending a large amount on what is basically a disposable item
dont expect to get more than a year or two out of any of these devices if you use them regularlymy last complaint is that there is only a minor memory boost only mb available memoryon the plus side the large footprint does give you a great big screen and the slide away graffiti area is functional and slicksony throws in some cute things like a  camera very poor performance a voice recorder and some software freebies like documents to go and clie memo which is a sort of postitnotes free writing programthe only thing i noticed about os was that standard jpeg pictures can be readthe major fix for me is that audio can now be played in the background you can listen to your mps while clicking around on this and that 
you can also change your playlist on the memory cardalthough the tried and true palm interface is still there out of the box it defaults to the new clie launcher
it looks cool and after a week or so of tinkering with it i have found that it not only looks refreshingly new but that it is just as quick if you can use your thumb on the jog dial and the back button to navigatebattery life seems spectacular
click around all day with little loss of poweri only give it  stars because even though it is great and cool and one heck of a handheld for me it is too big and heavy and the clam shellkeyboard design is cumbersome and frankly unnecessary
when something like my clie n gets os i will be back adding it to my shopping cartits a nice unit but the lack of a cf socket significantly limits its expansion capabilitiesi decided to go with the dell axim
it has an sd socket as well as cf
i put a memory module in the sd socket to store my mps and an ambicom wireless lan ieee b card in the compactflash socket for connectivity to my network and the internet
its a sweet setup even synchronizes to my desktop through the wireless connectionthink hard before you buy a unit without the cf socketis adequate
it is a smaller version of the very comfortable shoulder rest that one could buy in the s
this is right now the closest i could come to the older model
it sticks to the back of the phone well and makes it much more comfortable to hold the receiver between chin and shoulderits ok but the sticky part disintegrated
i had to add velcro to make it work
it is comfy
although my chiropractor hates itif you can replace the double stick tape with heavy duty velcro
that way you can reposition it as you feel necessary
with the double stick tape you only have one shot
velcro  cost sound quality is good but the connector has too tight of a connection
every time i pull this cable out of the back of my receiver the plastic connector disconnects from the cable and stays in my receiver
not worth the money unless you really like the sound of monster cables and dont plan on disconnecting the cable regularlyfor the price these are great especial the quality that went into making these
however like others have stated the fit  installing them has to be done carefully
they are basically are intended to be installed then never touched again
they do their job well but i was and am a little nervous if i ever have to pull them off the receiver or sub
they fit so tight that i was thinking that i was about to break off the inputs on both devices
i caution you to go slow and have a good grip as not to break anything
recommend but with cautiongood quality but very expensive for what you get
your mainly paying for the name
i saw no difference between the monster cable and ones that cost less than half the moneymonster has been pushing out incredibly overprices cables for years
most people have gotten hip to the fact that for the  or  bucks monster charges seriously good cables can be had
the end result is that stuff like this is now out there for  bucks
at  bucks these cables are serviceible and a fair dealodd thing is i have never seen plugs especially rca plugs made to fit so tightly
it is close to ridiculous
i guess monster figured that audiophiles would appreciates trying to put a size  foot into a size  shoe
theres are tight and a pain to change
but they work and are a decent cable for  bucks and very stupid for more than thatyes these cables are amazing only if you get full power at all times to your dvd player and tvif you have any power sags in your home the dvd image will appear flickering and hazy and you lose alot of detailbut like at night when i would use them around  in the morning when im able to suck all the power in the neighborhood the image will take your breath awayso needless to say i sent them back and stuck with my monster standard cables which look great all the timemonster  great cables however i was unaware that i should have ordered another cable with these for sound as you have no sound with these  but i am sure they would be great if you had all the cablesthe problem with this is that the cable plug itself is very thick and bulky
i had to run it behind my lcd tv mounted on the wall but it was very difficult to plug it in because it was so thick and bulky
i like monster cable but it was very hard to work withon the positive side one of the pins were bent
i shipped it to monster cable and they replaced it free of charge
that is their warranty
if a cable is defective theyll replace it free no matter how long youve had iti picked these up because they were on sale for a tremendous amount and i was curious to see if these monster cables would make any improvement on the picture for my tv
obviously i dont have an hdtv or i would be gettingcomponent video cablesinstead of svideo but for the equipment i own svideo is as good as it getsusing thephilips ph x automatic video selector and rf modulator i hooked up my cable tvdvr and dvd player using these monster svideo cables
the picture was noticeably improved although not as dramatically as i was hoping
everything is a bit sharper the colors a bit brighter and things just look a bit nicer over a standard svideo cable but i dont know if it was really enough to justify the pricei definitely wouldnt have bought these if it wasnt for the amazing discount and i think that is the only way they are worth while
i couldnt imagine paying the retail price for such a slight improvementim not an audiophile but i really like the sound that these speakers put out
the bass is very good and i love having control of the volume  bass settings at my fingertipsthe only complaint i have and it is a big one is that the length of the cables for the rear speakres make them almost unusable without av extenders or splicing in speaker cables
unless you are planning on putting your rear speakers right in front of you on your desk buy the neccessary cables needed to extend the lengthi write this review as a power user and a technology professional
i chose this switch as i have a history with the prosafe gs series switch at home and in the officefirst and foremost this switch is not friendly in all environments
in a lab office or closet it will work quite well
however i bought this for use in my bedroom where my personal computing equipment lives and i have to say the leds are far too bright
this switch was purchased to replace a gs not because it failed but because i needed more ports
the gs had reasonably bright leds so i did not expect to end up with a device that lights up my bedroom at nightthis complaint alone makes me greatly dislike the product
the trend with new technology devices seems to be moving to brighter and brighter indicator lights and this greatly annoys me
all i need is enough brightness to tell a distinct difference between off and onoutside of this it is an outstanding switch
my gs performed well for me for years
throughput was high especially with jumbo frames support and i never really had to dink with it
while i havent had the gs for very long it definitely feels like the gs with  extra ports which is all i could really ask for
while im not highly demanding on my network equipment i do work with large files from time to time and for the most part my limiting factors have been my computing equipment not the network
of course along with the gigabit switch i use high quality cat cables you can get these for reasonable prices so you dont have to spend a lot on this and its really worth the slight increase in costif you need a switch that is simple to set up can work in a variety of environments and you dont mind the bright led indicators then this is a good one to go for
if the bright led indicators are a problem for you you might want to research some other brands or find an older revision of the gsthis review is for the gse
it is unmanaged plus which apparently means you can make a few config settingsthe configuration software is terrible
there is no web interface
there is only a windows program
i can only get it to work on about  of the computers i install it on
and even if you can get it to run on the computer you install it on it still requires you to be on the same network segment as the switch in order to discover the switch and on the same ip subnet as the switch in order to use the program to configure the switch
in other words remotely changing the configuration is not possibleif you are used to the normal prosafe managed switch web interface do yourself a favor and dont get an unmanaged  switch
they are frustrating to configure
just spend a couple more bucks for the managed switchi have had this switch for a year and nine months
this past month i started to notice that one of my computers and not the same one everytime would just randomly lose the connection to the network
i would get ping fails etc
i tried everything until i decided to power cycle the switch then everything worked
couple days later it happened to another computer and this time i powered cycled the switch first and that fixed it
this happened several more times until i rmad the switch to netgear
i had to pay the postage to netgear but they sent me back what appears to be a new switch in a shrink wrapped box
i just got it yesterday so it is too early to tell if this one will be more stable
hopefully i can get more than  years out of it this time considering i paid  for this thingi bought this to use on my workbench and its done its job
the power connection seems like the weak point of an otherwise sturdy design
mine comes unpluggedloose every so often from being moved around
wouldnt be an issue if it was screwed to a wall in a closet
i do like the port lights right on the ports as its easy to interpretthis product does just what we wanted  allows us to expand our network to more than just the  devices that most routers acceptthe only problem weve had is that our computers run fine for about a day after which the internet connection seems to stop working
rebooting the cable modem router and switch solves this but its a hassle we didnt have to deal with until we installed this switchfyi we are using a netgear router and linksyscisco cable modemupdateive had this thing for aprox  years and it just died
longer life than id expect from networking gear in generali never did get great speeds out of it i have several hp procurves and recommend them over this although there certainly is a premium to pay thereif youre not expecting the absolute best speed this thing was very reliablegreat construction its nice and heavy but i hardly get over  megabits and no where near the speeds i get when i just wire my machines directly together
im not completely certain if mine is bad or theyre just poor in general but with my experience i would not recommend thisi have mixed feelings about this device
it was easy to set up and use
however after about a month of using it it started acting very strangely
if it had the ability to speak i think it might have started saying things like im sorry dave
i cant do thatthe primary reason i got this switch was because i bought a gigabit ethernet hard drive and i already owned a gigabit mac computer
i learnedthat if you try to transfer files at mb speed it takes forever
this switch did do a good job of transferring files from my mac to the hard drive atgb speed and it did it in a reasonably quick amount of timethe main input port on this switch seems fairly stable
however the other ports are very unstable and will just arbitrarily stop working
then five minutes later will work againive had a few times where the activity lights will go out but the port still works
or worse yet the activity lights will stay on even though the port has stopped working or theres no cable even plugged into that portother times i have to unplug my computer from one port and plug it into another port because that port on the switch will have just abruptlyquit working for no apparent reasonand if you try to call netgears tech support line you usually get someone in new delhi or god knows where and they dont have any clueas to why the switch doesnt worknext time i think ill look at a different manufacturerim not totally comfortable recommending this product except to people i dont likeswitch worked well for  months then  port completely died
i am not impressed with the quality and would not buy againno real magic to this product
does what its supposed to it  be an unmanaged switchi held back a couple of stars because the first one showed up dead ie
had the well documented netgear blinking lights of death syndrome
excellent service by amazon and the replacement has been working well for a few months nowbut the plus is lifetime support
so i just sent it in and get a new rmad one i have  of these in use at our business and  backupim a network engineer and these little devices are pretty robust
i have noticed that they will drop individual packets every now and again
nothing to extreme
i broke out wireshark and started sniffing packets that flowed through this box and looking at the technical specs it appears that netgear did not include enough internal storage space to hold a nat table larger them two to three devices
if you are using this device for one uplink and two devices beyond it it will work good if they are printers and something that is not accessed alot
if this is in line between a network and a device like a tv that streams depending on the device if it does not buffer will drop out of hd streaming or stop streaming all together when the nat table chokes and drops a packet
i have gone to some customers offices and they are running servers off of these things and they dont know why people are having connectivity issues
as a home device to split one drop into two its worth it but dont get these things anywhere near mission critical devices
i promise you will have connectivity issues and since this is not managed you cannot monitor with snmp
also as another side note if this device is in an enterprise network i have witnessed it create an arp storm
be very cautious of where you use this devicei like the looks of netgear consumer switches because of their metal blue casing the presence of kensington lock slot for gigabit models ability to mount them easily on the wall and their general sturdiness
however netgear seems to have quality problems
this port switch died after  year or so as happened to many other people and was replaced with new one after sent to back here in europe  year warranty is common
however i still believe netgear will get its act together in the coming years
my first netgear was port hub and have bought  netgear switches in addition
i will probably buy another netgear switch different model in the future if its needed but should it fail it will be the last one from netgearif you can get  in a game your don good it sounds great
that is if you can get even   mostly this card reverts back to its primitive  speaker stateeven though i have a  speaker set from creative itself
when playing games two out of three will revert the sound card drivers back to   in windows  se this is not a problem in xppro it is a major one
games that revert back include star trek bridge commander dungeon siegea microsoft quotdesigned for xpquot game hidden evilmost star trek games in fact fellowship of the ring system shock with eax enabled ultima eax enabled and most of the others i am too tired to find and referrence right now
in fact the only games that play in more than  soundeax are neverwinter nights and most bioware infinity titles
thats funny becasue everyone knocks infinity engine but it must have something going for it to work a nitpicky sound card such as this in  eax
everything else gamewiseea dreamscape sirtech ect doesnt work at all
i have heard others complain about this and say winamp can rectify the problem it does not  dont bother with the zx  its nothing special either and is just as bad
try a herc or phillipsdoood
its creativeso whatthis is a very interesting camera lots of features easy to use and to load pictures and or movies into computer
but i suspect its very vulnerable to sand damage
i carried mine in my pocket
after a couple of weeks a grinding noise on turn onoff
sand had gotten into the camera
warrenty voided
i would carry it in a ziplock bag from now onive been very happy with the shots taken outdoors but anytime i use the flash the subjects are extremely washed out to the point that i dont even bother saving the picturethe shutter lag is way too long  im constantly missing shots by a couple secondsa couple days ago the lens stopped retracting and i get the dreaded e error message
i called kodak and got an auth to repair it for  which is better than the  others have reported but im debating if i should send it in or not even for im thinking of getting the canon a as im very happy with my canon a i keep in my car all the timenote a large amount of reviews fall under the bose bashing category
while i dont particularly like bose products this review was written from an objective viewpoint based off experience with this productthese speakers are great for watching movies especially special effects heavy movies where surround sound is particularly important such as transformers
the subwoofer is amazing
i have heard many woofers that sound sloppy only good for music with a heavy and distinct bass part such as hiphop or techno
the bose lower frequency effects module is different in that it is controlled and smooth not overbearing
the surround sound effect is greatly enhanced by the small satellites because of their size they dont overcrowd the room with sound
watching movies is a pleasure with this systemunfortunately i cannot say the same about listening to music
the main problem is that there is no substitute for diaphragm size
sound is produced by moving air
small speakers simply arent able to move enough air to accurately produce instrumental music
listening to a santana cd the sound seems distant not immersive the sound is not richso if you want a minimally intrusive speaker system for you home theater this is the product for you
if you enjoy listening to music i would suggest looking at tower speakersif you have any questions i would be happy to answer themupdateit seems that dialogue doesnt come through very well
turning up the level on the center channel helps a little but theres always this lack of clarity and depth especially with male voices
in general listening through these speakers leaves one with the feeling that theres something missing
its not about volume either since a good speaker should sound good even at low listening levelsi had a mib keyboard that this unit did not uninstall although during the installation it indicated that it did
uninstalled the old keyboard then the bluetooth would not work
the mouse worked fine although it was slow in waking up
it also didnt seem to track as fast as the wired mousecontacted microsoft amp they recommended returning it to the store
best buy didnt have any more units so i bought a logitech unit for  less
havent tried it yeti like the audiotron a lot but at this point i think it is getting dated and you get products with many more features at a reasonable
the one thing the audiotron has going for it is that it looks like a normal stereo componentsetting it up is pretty simple
just connect it to your network and stereo then set share music on your pcs
the audiotron will search the network for shares and unless otherwise configured search for particular directory namesthe web interface allows you to log into the audiotron and change configuration or even what it is playing
unfortunately the interface doesnt work very well for large music collections
it doesnt allow searching and songs arent always organization the way you would anticipate which can make finding music frustratingmy biggest gripe with the product is that it doesnt support the full range of wma bit rates
i believe it is capped somewhere around   unfortunately they only tell you this deep in the knowledge base of their website
i found this after after reripping my entire collection and then spending a couple hours trying to figure out why the audiotron wasnt playing anything
nice customer focus peoplemonster thximini thx certified  stereo to stereo rca cable adapteri bought this cable as a means to connect my maudio avs to my pc
i made the error of not correctly measuring the length which was my error
of course good ol amazon is taking them backthe signal quality for this cable is great but you would be better off using it for a towstrap
i overlooked and or didnt pay close enough attention to other reviews describing this problem
if you have any other connections anywhere close to your speaker input connection the mm head of this cable will interfere
the rca heads are kind of huge also baraly fitting into a standard set of sockets next to each other
use a straight  end nonmonster sizedsorry monsteri needed some cheap headphones and saw these on sale so i bought them
the sound quality is pretty good
better than  of all ear buds you can buy but that really doesnt say much
these are not as nice as my grado srs but fine for most uses
the one thing that worries me is that they are made from what feels to be cheap plastic
i am hoping they wont break very easily
then again i only paid  for themi purchased these for my husband wears xl size motorcycle helmet
he did not like the fit at all
while the band size makes a good fit the actual phones are angled
this causes the them to constantly slide forward making them useless
we tried to use them for our yearold but they were way too big for his head
if you like the angled style you will probably be ok with these
if you like a tight fit you definitely wont like thesethese have an inline volume control which is critical as i wear them primarily when walking dogs exercising or cleaning house
since the outside environment in those situations vary greatly in sound being able to turn the volume updown is critical
you know up for barking dogs or vacuming down low when a neigbor stops to chat or im dustingi am on my third pair of them but for roughly  bucks a pair and given that i am a little rough on things that is perhaps to be expected
they lasted as long as the first pair of sennheisners which cost close  times as much
since i am not listening to music the sound quality is not critical for my purposes
the spoken voice sounds just fine and when occasionally when there is music i can tell why they are not that great but they are definately good enough short termthe blue band thah iis supposed to adhere to your head doesnt really work for that purpose and they are a bit flimsy adjusting so get them the right size prior to putting them on your headi purchased these to use with my tv in my bedroom to listen to at night while my wife is trying to sleep
had to purchase a different pair because my wife could still hear the sound while i was wearing them
i then tried them with my iphone
they work okay but i find them vevy uncomfortalble on my ears
i think its because the speakers pivot and dont fit flat on your ears
i cant seem to adjust them to fit good
i have a size  head which is on the small side and my wife can still hear the music if she is near me
i didnt pay much for them because i purchased them off ebay for about  i replaced them with a pair of sennheiser hd  i bought off amazon for about 
what a difference a litle bit heavier but a lot more confortable better sound quality and when i wear them connected to the tv at night my wife cant hear anything
would highly recommend the sennheiser if your using them with a sound systemthese work ok but i bought them with the intention of using them on a flight and even at full volume the noise of the plane made it impossible to heari love the enhanced bass that the larger drivers give compared to buds but had to modify  them
either my head is small or the designers screwed up even putting them on over a bb cap left a gap at the top allowing the earpieces to slip down off my ears
taped some foam on and no more problems
this is a lot of sound for  just wish they got the sizing right
and yes i did adjust the earpieces up as far as the unit would allowmy koss headphones from  years ago pro  from radio shack finally gave up so i got what i thought was going to be as close to the exact same thing i had
they sound similar but these are nowhere near as comfortable
they feel much more like a  pair of headphonesgranted i have a larger melon than most people but their older versions never fit this badbought these to use at work cause i was tearing up my koss porta pros
after a side by side listening test i can most definitely hear the difference
the porta pros have a better low and high end they should have for twice the price not quite as efficient as the kxtpros more volume on the kxts than the portapros at the same setting
having said that for the money they are a good buy and have kosss lifetime warranty
if you have the extra bucks go for the porta proswell i just recieved these and only have maybe a couple hours of use on them
my first impression was well they are better than the apple nano stockers
i will say they are extremely comfortable on my above average size head not to mention they sit nice on the ears
dont have any gripe about that what so ever like some have
the slider volume is nice but i wont use it much due to them breakin easily from other reviewers
so will use the ipod as much as possible
i did get these mostly for my mp ipod but have yet to test them on the computer
will see how they sound on that and give an updated reportabout the sound they seem very crisp on most songs but i do notice some distortion on certain rock songs
i pretty much crank it due to me being in competitive spl db drag racing back in the day
i am sure a lot of you have no clue what that means but to say my hearing is good would be a lie lol
lets just say i would sit in db plus vechichle constantly without hearing protection like an imbecile
about the bass i will say the bass is there in these and sounds decent but i do find myself adjusting my eq on my ipod with each album which is no big deal but kinda annoying to an extentoverall i give it a  for the price alone
i paid  bucks and now see they are even cheaper
so i would recommend them for anything under  smacks otherwise i would spend a little more and get something elsethey dont compare to a set of akgs i bought my dad a couple years ago for his computer but probably because of the signal
also my akgs were over  smacksamazon is an awesome place to do shopping though and i give them a  for ease of use and the shipping was well ahead of schedule as always
great job amazonbought these  years ago and intially was happy with purchase
sound is good but not great
i have a large head and after wearing for an hour or so i would begin to feel discomfort
the builtin volume control is a nice but not necessarily a needed feature
after years of minimal use the right side speaker stopped working
not too bad for  bucks but i am use things lasting longer as i take excellent care of my stuffthese are light weight plastic headphones with a volume control on the cord
it was the volume control that attracted me to these headphones
they have foam ear pieces are very light and you can adjust the ear pieces up and down
you can not adjust the overall width of the headset so they may not fit perfectly but given the light weight and foam ear pieces it is unlikely you will feel too much tension on your headto be frank given the cost they are a fair value but if you were looking for high end audiophile quality id look elsewhere but the volume control is quite handythese headphones are above average in performance
howeverdo not be fooled by the many reviews seen
they do notsound superb as is being reported by other reviewersi am a sound conosseuir and these are just ordinaryone bad thing about it though the earfoam cannot be userreplaced
mine eventually disintegrated into powderlike stuff but the part left on the phones cannot be removed without damaging the unit
what 
nowi have to use sports socks as paddingthese are excellent headphones for the paltry  pricetag
but there are a few caveats one should be aware ofi have owned a pair going on  years now
i purchased the radio shack optimus branded version of these phones
they were identical to the old version of these phones except for the optimus brand name
well i purchased a pair of these phones with an updated design because the foam pads on my old ones were wearing outfirst off they still sound pretty good
yes the treble is lacking but they are far better than stock earbuds
in the comfort department however they fail miserably compared to the old version
the rubber band that goes across the head pulled on my hair which annoyed me no end
the plastic headband is also not good because of the pressure it puts on my sensitive ears
with the plastic band you cant bend the earpieces apart to provide a lighter grip unless you possibly apply some heat
why koss why
i guess im just biased by the old ones i still own
i ended up taking the sound elements out of the new phones and attaching them to the old headband assembly and they sound as good as they always havewhen first opened there is a huge straight plug
this pulls off to reveal a small straight plug
i really prefer the performance of the lplug as shown but its a hassle to return and will give the straight plug a try only because of the reasonable price
if they crap out after a few months ill update here
but this is a straight plug and not an lplugim used to the porta pros and the ear curshions on this one are small and hurt my ears after extended use
sound is almost as good as porta proswife didnt like the fit  not very soft and hard to fit on heads  they were cheap and we took a chance now they are yard sale fodderits a decent pair of  over the ear headphoneslike the  different adapter plugs for all portable devices with standard mm as well as the  mm for stereossomething to toss around not to be confused with any high end headsetslike the weight and sound but wont work for my application at alli wanted something lightweight and not too smothering for metal detecting and they are but everytime i bend down to dig they fall offi do have a smaller head at   but i have to wear a hat just to match them to my ears fully retracted and theres not enough tension to keep them in place with even moderate movement be great for sitting aroundthese koss headphones have a fantastic sound quality to my ears
i also have two other brands of headphones and these have by far the best sound quality
however i am sorry to report that i have bought two of this model and both of them quit in less than six months each
in both instances they developed what i suppose is a short or something similar because they started to crackle and pop and the sound would go off in the left earphone
if i held the wire just right it would fix the problem but you shouldnt have to do that
none of the other reviews i read here mentions the problems ive had so maybe i just had bad luck
but i would definately recommend them for their sound
also the volume control got me hooked for life
so convenient to uselove the sound but the little volume control thingy broke apart after just a few weeks of use
superglue fixed the break but the sound control no longer worksother than that the sound quality is decenti gave this  stars because it is adequate i like the volume control on the lead wire but the headphone pads dont sit flush to my ears like other sets kind of a strange angle not that comfortable and allows too much sound in from surroundings
not sure whose head these would fit and they cannot be altered or bent to fit right to my earsthis was one of two sets of headphones i purchased last school year for my son to use in the school computer lab
they came home last week broken
more specifically the wiring in the left ear piece broke at the solder point and the portion with the foam covering came off
i would have expected my gradeschooler to have broken the frame portion of the headset before the wiring broke off inside the earpiecethese do not sound as good as portapros  the sound is more constricted with less treble extension and a poorer soundstage bass is just as strong
they have the same koss house sound but are a step down  i am disappointed
they do sound better than freebies included with portable cd players and youll certainly notice the improvementthe cord is the real weakness  its just horrible awful cheap plastic and i predict will not last anytime at all with active portable use
the volume control slider is also cheap and guarantee will get scratchy sounding fast
ok theyre only  but ive come to expect a better level of quality from koss shame on themverdict  if youre really poor or you cant stand the look of the portaproportapros then get these
otherwise avoid them as they are just too cheaply made to be durable
 update ten days later  i ordered a pair of these for myself and a pair for my brother
mine seem to be fine although the volume control is already getting scratchy as i predicted but one of the earpieces on my brothers pair died within  hours of opening the package
luckily amazon has an excellent return policy and they even shipped the replacement immediately so they arrived two days after i notified them about the returnit should also be noted that koss has a lifetime warranty on these so for six bucks shipping you can get a replacement anytime
of course koss still comes out ahead since it probably costs them fifty cents to make these and less than a buck to ship them backthese headphones have good sound quality but they dont fit properly to maximize what the listener can hear
i was very disappointed with the fit of the headset and have been unable to find a position on my head which is comfortable for more than  minutes
the ear pads dont pivot to conform to the ear and the speakers are not able to be positioned to hear everything the speakers are putting out
i like the sound but wouldnt recommend them because they are painful to wearthis product was so cheap when i bought it i can say that all other qualities are all most irrelevant
they are not the most comfortable but can be tolerated for a good amount of time
very light weight
sound quality is good but not great
i just cant abide the earphone type things
these worked well as a replacement
too soon to say anything about longevitythe main reason for me to buy these headphones was the good reviews
but when i received them i felt kind of disappointed
they looked weak and made of cheap plastic
the wires are so thin that they tangle very easily
why did this item get so many good reviews
i think i have the answer
there are two pictures the one from the seller lets call it no and a customer image from someone named william g pursell lets call it no
these are not the same productimage no shows and lplug while image no
 shows a straight plug
thats a big difference
straight plugs break off very easily and are not very useful when you have a space issueimage no
 shows big foam ear cushions that look very comfortable and protective
image no shows very small foams that barely exceed the loudspeakers
smaller foams mean lower protection less comfort and lower qualityimage no
 shows a silver volume control smaller than the loudspeakers
image no
 shows a plastic black volume control as large as the loudspeakers
i really cant tell if product no has smaller loudspeakers or a bigger volume control than product no
i received the cheap product shown on image no
 and i guess  and  stars reviewers received the one on image nosomething good i can say so far is that the sound is good but this is my first day using it
i dont know if the poor material will keep the good sound for longi was really looking forward to getting this radio
for the s i really did expect a little more
that aside the two big problems  the led or digital numbers faded after about  days  are so broken up i cannot identify the stations
thank god for presets
 the carry handle is built into the radio  is therefore very awkward to carry
ive almost dropped the radio several times
because of the led problem w so many customers i would never buy this model again
i have ordered the new model radio dont know the model  but sells for over im hoping to have better luck w ituntil recent years i was a serious short wave sw radio enthusiast
in midwest usa you must have a serious portable sw  basic antenna knowledge  skills to listen to world band radio
i began with sangean radios because they were the less expensive quality sw units that were rated favorably by the geeks at passport to world band radio
like consumer union geeks they do not pay much heed to quality build over time that is how well a model holds up with use
i had sangeans top three models in the s  s
not one worked for more than  to  years
i suspect they have built in failure as the same thing seems to fail in each expensive model
a side note sangean sells mostly smaller inexpensive sw radios to asia and europe all countries where sw is radio or is a major radio signal source
the cheaper  smaller units hold up well over time
by far the worlds market for high end powerful sw units is america  canada where signals come from far awayi was a long term customer of ccrane until my experience with their much hyped ccrane radio
i knew ccrane had sangean making their radios but ccrane bragged about their engineers designing them  their controlling the manufacturing specs
i guess we can blame ccrane then for the built in short life of these expensive turkeysi spoke several times with mr crane over the years i asked him each time where can i get a quality portable am radio
they disappeared after the  japanese radio invasion
mr crane finally told me ccrane engineers just finished design of a unique radio with unheard of am quality reception  sound especially designed for talk radio human voicei bought a ccrane even though sangean made it for ccrane
since ccrane was the largest north american retailer of sangean products i figured ccrane controlled the manufacturing specs
i liked the radio so much i bought three more for gifts
all four were useless in about two years all for the same reason
the top buttons stopped working properly and the display quit displaying station numbers well enough to locate stations
about  years or so you will be forced to find stations blind and you will no longer be able to push button locate preset stations
it is like a mean practical joke that both go and they go about the same timei wrote crane about the  units
they offered to repair them at my cost if i returned them insured at my expense
i threw three out and never bought from them again
i still use one by leaving it permanently on one am station
the problem is they are made by sangean and ccrane does not bother to exercise their clout with sangean to order a quality upgrade for the display or the buttons
here we are years later ccrane now sells the ccrane plus and it sports the same defects the bad design and make push button system  the discount display
a digital radio is useless without its display or buttonsif you do not mind paying a few hundred dollars every two years for a higher end world band radio without the quality sound of a sony ge super radio not digital or a s grundig or  for a ccrane radio i can highly recommend ccrane brandby the way i can still sell my  grundig   small yacht boy  for about what i paid for themi own two of these radios
i use them all the time and i would gladly buy two new cc radios if sangean would just fix the damn thing
the other reviewers have it right
it does funny thingsthe memory buttons dont work right half the time the display fades in and out it turns itself on even even when not set to do so
but it has great sound runs forever on a set of batteries and doesnt cost muchi last reviewed this radio after my initial purchase almost one year ago
my original opinion for the most part hasnt changed
compared to other portable radios its reception capabilities on am is above average
i did however purchase a terk am advantage antenna to use with it because am reception is really important to me
that makes a world of difference
the tv  fm reception are good
the weather band does a fairly good job as well depending on your location
overall sound is good but i wish the bass were a big stronger
battery life is superbnow for its downfalls
similar to what another reviewer said sometimes the station preset buttons have to be given a good push to change the channel but they always work
i also wish there were jacks on the back for an external fm antenna as well as an am antenna
last but not least another reviewer complained of an earlier model losing the digital display from time to time
this has also happened to my radio
on several occasions some of the digits have suddenly vanished
then after a little while they returned
its very very tempermental
it may go months with no problems then suddenly itll act up for a day or so then correct itself and be fine again
i was all set to return it to c crane then thought id wait to see if it did it again
im keeping my fingers crossed
ive knocked my rating down to  stars following the vanishing digit incidentapril th update  late last fall i became so frustrated with the lcd on this radio that i called c crane
they were familiar with this issue  gave me a repair  with intsructions to send it back to them
i did  after about  weeks or so it returned with a new lcd and has had no problems since
the best thing of all they repaired it for free
absolutely free
so if i were you still having this issue id stop complaning and call themi would also like to also add a th star to my ratingi too have had the lcd display on this radio go wonky on me
periodically it just starts displaying garbage characters and gibberish
when i contacted ccrane about this i was told that i would have to pay to have it repaired since the radio is no longer within the warranty period
to me this seems totally unfair since there is obviously a designengineering flaw with the radio and they know about it
yet they are failing to stand behind their customer service and products which to me seems very disingenuous and slimy of them
frankly i thought ccrane was a better company that thisother than the lcd flaw i really like the radioit sounds great has a good feature set and seems sturdy and it works good as a clock radio to wake me up most mornings although when the lcd is acting up i cant see what time it is or what station the radio is tuned toive had this radio for about  or  years spurred on by those endless commercials on talk radio about how this radio is specially tuned to the human voice 
and like thousands of others i fell for it
but from reading the other reviews i didnt fall that hard
this radio has many good attributes alooks great
except for the lcd display this radio could have come straight out of the mid to late s a good thing in my book bits substantial
weighing in at over what is it lbs or so this is no gpx or coby flyweight piece of you get the idea
if you live in a high crime area you can practically use it as a weapon
cit has separate bass and treble controls hard to find these days
di guess this shouldve been a in my apt here in nyc the am reception is exceptional fm and tv band work great although after the us tv industry switches over to digital no more tv sound on this radio   i rarely use this function but the reception is excellent
i get one station on weatherband loud and clearly enough
stay tuned for morewhy is everyone making such a big deal about the screen
sonys had  by   bit color screens since  and you dont hear them bragging
alot of them have even had mp players built in and two of them have videophoto cameras built in
all of them have memory stick slots not only the higher priced ones like palm does
sony was also the first to use usb connections too
they were the first to intergrate  mhz and mhz processers
they have been revolutionizing the handheld industry for  years
this palm tungsten t may have a nice screen but its nothing new so they have no bloating rightsthe screen is great and the processor is fast but you have to question whether its worth the extra width extra weight and the inconvenience of having to open a slider every time you want to write something
also many of the applications for palm have not been upgraded yet to run under palm os its schizophrenic  it really does compete well with the ipaq for multimedia etc but how many really need that stuff or havent already moved to a pocket pc if thats what they wanti returned it after a few weeks and went back to my  which is simply to me more convenient both to carry and to usei needed a monitor quick and decided on a lcd to save desk top space
after looking at various lcd sizes i decided i could live with a  lcd
my buying criteria was for a  lcd to drop below
i pounced on it
the monitor was easy to set up and had no dead pixels
the size is great and the speakers were an added bonus though they are fairly puny sounding
so why would i give this lcd only  stars
quite frankly the resolution is fairly coarse
small fine text is difficult to read and pictures as well as video look coarse
so my buying advice is as followsdont buy this lcd if you are paranoid about display fidelity or if you demand high quality sound from the speakersdo buy this lcd if you are looking for an inexpensive and reliable  year warranty  lcd and speaker sound quality is not a high prioritybased on my time and budget constraints i would purchase this lcd againpower cord system incomplete i can charge the battery but the cord from the charger to power the camcorder is missing
also the microphonemicrophone adapter clamp and holder are missing from the camera
they never came with the order as pictured when i made my orderdoesnt work with itunes since version   it simply wont burn cds  which is frustrating as all hell
its probably an applemac issue tho i am not sure of this however data cdrs should work on any machine if its not a machine issuethey dot work in all cd players but theyre fairly standard cdrsthese cdrs will work with most systems
 of mine recorded just fine
the only problem i had was that over time the white coating on the cd has started to peel off
this hasnt happened to all my discs but a few of them have started to chip causing problems with the playbackin general these are pretty good budget price cds for everyday use
but if youre looking for something to save your songs or data for a long period of time choose something elsewhen i purchase cdrs i usually go by whats on sale because as i thought all cdrs were pretty much the same
i found out how wrong i was
what i discovered is that even though the cd would seem to burn without a problem when i would play the burned disks on my new stereo system after the first few tracks it would sound as if the disk was skipping
it would get so bad as to only play a couple seconds freeze up for a min then play a couple more just to freeze up again
at first i was surpised and i thought that either my cd burner was going bad considering it was brand new or my stereo just didnt like burned disks
i just couldnt believe that either the stereo or the burner was the problem so i decided to do an experiment to figure out the reason behind the issue
i know for a fact it isnt my stereo as it works perfectly with any other brand of cdr i have burned with imation verbatim
what i did is i burned a memorex cdr with some songs on it as well as a verbatim cdr with the same stuff on it
then i tried to play both in my cd player and guess what the memorex was skipping and the verbatim worked perfectly
both  packs of memorex i bought had the same issue throughout the package
my cd player on the other hand doesnt have as much of a problem with the memorex disks and doesnt stop playing but you can notice a faint skipping sound in the background if you listen closely
im sure not all of you will have the same issue of skipping because i do only notice it a lot on my stereo system
since memorex no longer does the trick for me i will not be buying them anymore no matter what sale is going on
i just dont trust them
i was turned off to memorexs cdrws a few years back because they would burn but about half the cds in the  pack wouldnt erase after theyd been burned on
i just dont get it i know imation cdrs and rws work perfectly and i know verbatims cdrs and rws work just as well as i have not encountered a problem like with memorex
not saying any of you will experience the same issues or notice the skipping but dont say i didnt warn you if you have the same issues
maybe i just got a bad batchtwicelolok
the reason everyone is getting iffy disks and some bad disks is the new dye used in production of the disks
it does not matter what brand you buy they are all produced usually in the same plant in chinause imageburn afreeware program to see what the country of manf
is and the actual brand name
all media today is made in either china or malashia and the china disks are usually all badimageburn will show you that sony or verbatim disks are actually stamped out in the same country and usually in the same plantso i used to buy only tdk then major issues
switched to verbatim and the worked out much better
however now all the reviews for this year seem like the products has gone to the cheaper dye
so im looking into a different brandthe only problem is you never know until you buy them where they were stamped out at and if they will be any goodim now burning a lot of cdr media and have had a few bad verbatim disks as far as music is concerned
no questions its the media
the problem is they all use this cheaper dye and switching brands is now pot luck
this is just horrible quality control no matter what brand you buyi suppose ill go back to the verbatim and hope for the best
at least with them i only had about  bad burns during playback out of a  packi am quite disappointed in this bag and in myself as well
i judged based on other peoples comments that this would be a worthwhile inexpensive bag and it has everything as stated durable material many pockets fits my panasonic pvgs video cam and canon powershot a in its own case along with gorillapod extra batteries extra dv tapes no problemso whats the problem
you are hopefully asking yourself the main compartment has a double zipper that can be opened from either end and one of them ripped
that means that the thing still closes from one end but i have to be careful not to zip it too far the other way or it will slip off
bummer but still functionallike i said you get what you pay for so i got an ok bag that requires ongoing vigilance when i open and close iti bought two of these to maximize the storage capability of my old macintosh powerpc g
it gave me the capability of twincloned hard drives so i could boot to the other in case the primary hard drive failed
that generation of macintosh circa  had a hard drive max of  gb two drives chained to the same ide cable maximized very nearly the maximum ide storage capabilities of my old maceven an ancient mac can do things that current windows machines cannot including staying perfectly stable over a decade lateri havent bought a universal remote in many years last one was an overpriced oneforall av producer  that proved so difficult to program that it is currently just a tv remote
hardly worth the price
i found the sima sur for a reasonable price and decided to try it outthe good  very simple to program involving relatively few steps
the devices that didnt work with the preprogrammed codes were easy to transfer from their remote using the learning function and i think it covered just about every key i needed
some keys took a couple of tries to learn but they finally got in there
its nice to have two pages for every device to maximize your options
the touchscreen was fun and felt hightech to use
i like that the learning infrared eye is on the bottom as opposed to headtohead
the flash memory that retains all your work when the battery is removed is very nicethe bad  the biggest bad was that once i got the whole thing programmed every time i tried to use it for my satellite dish which was my primary motivation for buying it it would lock up
the solution given in the manual is to remove a battery for ten seconds this is when the flash memory is really helpful especially since i was constantly removing a battery
i emailed sima and they told me to send it in for repair at a cost of  times as much as id paid for the unit
i have no idea how common a defect it is for this company so im not willing to risk trying it againsmaller bads were that there was no way to label the selfprogrammed buttons on the touchscreen so you basically have to memorize what youve put where
the green touchscreen looks really dated compared to the new bluelit ones out there
the reaction time for all buttons hard and soft was a bit on the slow side
also the safety feature of pressing a sequence of buttons before programming anything to avoid accidental programming if you sit on it i suppose gets most tedious after awhilei had these for about a year before sound went out in the left bud
i did have problems with the buds coming out of my ears but not too much to be bothered with it
i would just stickl them back in every once in awhile
over a  mile run i would have to reinsert the earbud  times
the main reason i liked these though is because of the design
the connector fits over the back of your head instead of on top of it and the wire runs down the middle of your back
this keeps the phones out of the way of my hat and away from my arms and also made it less noticeable that i had headphones in
i can take my hat off while running without having to remove my phones first
ive looked for other headphones that have this design but cant find anyhowever the sound quality wasnt that great about what i would expect for  phones and i can see how the buds slipping out would be annoying for some people
in fact if the phones didnt have the behindthehead design i talked about id probably give them only  stari was looking for some computer speakers to use temporarily and i took a chance on these
i wouldnt rate them as highly as the other reviewers
playing one video i heard a high pitch squeal sound so i plugged in a different set of speakers and no longer heard that sound so im returning them
maybe i just got a defective set of speakersi read most of the  reviews before ordering two of these lamps for my bedroom as i have been looking for something stylish and contemporary and not overly expensive
i was excited when i found these lamps as i really thought that this was it
well i was disappointed when they arrived today for various reasons
they are not touch lamps
the invoice clearly states non touch
this was not indicated at the point of purchase or when order was processed and shipped
they are considerably bigger than the picture respresents
one of the lamps has a  pronged crack in the shade but its not actually broken its just a crack inside the glass
wasnt this inspected before shipping
another reviewer mentioned receiving a lamp like this so i am guessing that these defective ones are still shipped instead of being returned to the manufacturer as damagedall of that said they do look nice on my bedside tables so i am not returning them partly because i cannot be bothered with all the hassle
i live in the caribbean so to go through the returns process will probably cost me more than i shelled out for them in the first placethis product is exclusively for making digital connections to your stereo
this product offers nothing for making analog connections to your stereodont know why xitel bothers to put analog outputs on this device because the device inserts a  hz hum into the music just like what happens if you run an analog connection straight from your computers sound cardif you dig down into xitels web site youll see that they sell an audio isolation transformer for  to eliminate the  hz hum caused by a ground loop between the computer and stereopros  the cables are almost worth the price alone
  easy install amp operationcons  this product is really just for making an opticaldigital connection to your stereo
the analog rca connection introduces a  hz hum to the music just like what would happen if you ran a cable from you computers sound card
  could you buy a sound card with an optical output and an optical cable for the device seems to perform generally well i was concerned however that the product claims to be fully internally powered but when i connected my wd passport gb disk directly to it the drive was underpowered clicking and not initializing properly
i plug the same drive directly into my laptop and my car stereo and there is no problemalso note that the power adapter is huge taking up  sockets on a surge strip easily
the connector to the device is lshaped facing to the left
as a result the cables do not settle well and device remains ajar many timesother than these the device seems to work well though i have not tested the speed and performance to each device connected to itthe card works fine i am somewhat disappointed that the package did not include a protective case  which i have come to expect
this is the first cf card i have bought that did not include the casei purchased the itrigue s to replace my bose mediamates because my deskspace was getting very tight with an lcd monitor  cell phone chargers  pda cradles a lamp and alarm clock
the slim and sleek design matched with a subwoofer and generous frequency range seemed to be a fantastic combination
but as i found out you really need to hear a set of speakers to really decide what you likedesign  starsthe silver diecast material used on the casing is very attractive and feels very wellbuilt
the black speaker covers can be removed to give it an even better looksound  starsthe itrigue s are all treble and bass
the midrange is nearly nonexistant and for each pc application i need to set the equalizer settings which i didnt have to do with my bose speakers
in itunes the setting that worked best for me is the pop eq settingremote  starsthe wired remote is very handy with a volumepower control headphone jack and bass level dial
the bass level dial is a very much appreciated design change from the old speakers where the bass controls were located on the back of the subwoofer
there is a cool indigo led on the remote to indicate that the speakers are powered onvalue  starsthe itrigue is a pretty expensive  setup considering that the fidelity derived from these speakers are not up to par with the competitionsummarythese attractive spacesaving speakers are a big jump from those crappy little harmon kardons you got with your system
with an watt total system power rating itll pump up the bass and provide loud shaking music and gaming effects
but for retail cost you can find much better speakersthese are very good speakers for gaming and full range mighty wurlitzer recordingshighly detailed rank definition during playbackusing thats entertainment chris elliot cuts thats entertainment and danse macabre but i found them a bit too bright for the eagles hotel california cuts hotel california and life in the fast lane and likely the recording was at fault a digital remastering of brahms  symphonies by karajan as it sounded tinny and thin with the s
all the above were more listenable to me on cls inspire s with single cone midrange and tweeter satellites while ill switch back to until my logitech z gets here and then give that a try
socl itrigueyou get a close but no cigar
from mei wanted to buy a decent sounding  system for my computer but i didnt want to spend more than 
i narrowed my choice down to the creative labs itrigue   system vs the altec lansing vs  system
i went to a local circuit city and a local best buy to listen to both systems sidebysideinterestingly at both stores the itrigue  system on display was not working
at one store the left satellite speaker did not work
at the other store the entire system would power up but would not make a sound
i made sure that the source was ok and that everything was hooked up correctly
the store clerk decided the itrigue  system was blown and hooked up a new one for me to listen to fresh out of the box
that system worked fine but the experience did make me wonder about the durability of the creative labs system
i was also somewhat turned off by the cheap fiddly cloth grilles that come with the creative labs satellite speakers
after listening to the creative labs and altec lansing systems sidebyside i decided that despite the higher power rating of the creative labs system and the fact that it can pump out more raw volume than the altec lansing system the vs sounded cleaner and and more balanced probably because it includes larger midrange speakers and because its subwoofer is not so overpoweringas an added bonus the price of the altec lansing system was about  less than the creative labs systemits okay but i wish the black would print darker
makes what you printed look more professional
i dont think i would print my photos on this printer because i dont think they would come out crisp and sharp if there is any black in the photowhen i first got this printer it worked very well but it is not an hp far from it
but now i cant get it to print and run out of ink when it does work
my computer does not see this printer for some reason and i have to keep going from ubs port to ubs port to see if it will work most times it wont
time for a new printerit works great though sometimes from sleep the keyboard or the mouse doesnt respond but i just unplug the adapter and plug it back in
it does work well though the keyboard i am using it with has media controls on it such as playpause forward back stop volume up volume down those controls didnt end up working they just translated into letters and dont function the same way they do when plugging it into a desktop
i would recommend this product though if you wanna use a keyboard with media controls those controls will most likely not workupdateafter using it for a while ive noticed that very often the mouse im using with the adapter randomly right clicks or scrolls by itself when just moving the mouse i really dont know if its the mouse or the adapter i dont have another mouse to test it on
i would still recommend this product but mainly if you have a ps keyboard you need to connect to a computer via usbthe only thing that is wrong with these devices is that they occasionally will fault out on linuxubunutu pcsreseating the device normally resolves the issue but it shouldnt of failed in the first placei know i didnt pay much for it but was very flimsy but it works but doesnt seem like it would be good if moved around muchfunny how i am using the device to type this review it works
however i could not play video games with the keyboard
the device seems to not let you hold down more that one key so it was impossible for me to use the arrow keys and hit another key at the same time since it would forget that i was still holding onto the arrow key to move the character so the character would all of the sudden stop movingin short it is good for typing not good for video games that require you to hold down more than one key at a timei did not test the mouse since i didnt need that partit functions part of the time
does not work consistently  i would not purchase this item and expect it to function correctlyone set doesnt work at all the working ones do not map all the keys iedelete key doesnt work great price so that softens the problem somewhatwhile using this about every  minutes the keyboard shuts down momentarily and i miss about  letters in my typing
this thing also makes my usb hub malfunction
i have to unplug the keyboard then plug in the hub
once the hub is functional then i can plug this inlooking at the other reviews it seems that it might work for you or it might not
it didnt work in my situation but i can see that it obviously works for some devices andor for some computer systems
but for the price its worth a shotagain canon seems to like to charge a little more for their plastic
no need to pay  bucks
just go get an off brand rear lens cap
sure it doesnt say canon on it but i am sure it will protect your rear lens just the samecanons lens caps are welldesigned and provide a snug tight fit with a minimum of effort
they work perfectly with canon lenses as well as with canon compatible lenses by tokina tamron and sigma
the same cant be said for some tamron lens caps which are fine on a tamron lens but loose on some canon lenses
tokinas caps may not be as easy to grip but might fit even tighter than canonswhile functionality is not an issue cost is
like many photo accessories this canon cap is overpriced unless you think seven dollars for a piece of plastic is not ridiculous
there are alternatives
manufacturers in asia expert at copying products sell comparable lens caps on ebay for a for a dollar or two
the canon cap is great but if you can get an equivalent product much cheaper does it really matter whos name is on iti love the ipaq but the battery life is really awful compared to everyone elses
i was amazed to learn that some people can have their units on stand buy for weeks i cant have my ipaq on stand by for days
 or  days will completely drain the battery and cause you to have to restore all your programs and everything
its slower than others in its class and it had more memory
the screen is bright and easy to see and the finger print scanner is nice
i dont understand how others have both sd and cf card slots when this unit is actually larger and only has an sd slot
it a nice unit just way to costly for what you getthe hp ipaq  pocket pc has some very good features as you would have seen in other reviews but the  things i did not like about it are i never got the biometric reader to work
 the battery died after  months of use it did not even switch on when i installed the expansion pack which was an additional expensethe bottom line buy a cheaper model without the biometric reader and save some moneythe ipaq  seemlessly integrates with ms outlook on one computer but has issues with syncing up to a second pc
user selection for data overwrite is limited handheld overwrite pc or pc overwrite handheld data
overall features are really neat some stuff included is kinda useless for the average electronics gizmo but the battery life is horrible
if youre planning to go out of town for a couple of days youll need a charger get   one for the rental car and one for the hotel room
extended life battery is recommended as is an extended service plan if one is offered to you at time of purchase
i had to have mine sent back and  other people in my office also had to during their first few weeks of use
the convenience offered by the available features outweighs the annoyances of losing data due to the battery dyingi switched from a stowaway to this when i bought a t
the lack of dedicated number keys is highly annoying if you are a touch typist
having to hit a fn key instead of shift to get to parens is also really annoying
size and rigidity is a plus but i never thought the stowaway was that big
overall if you are a touch typist id say this one will annoythis is an ok product for what im using it for
i have a nikon d and wanted to be able to charge two batteries at the same time this is not the case
it only charges one battery at a time
i probably should have researched and read more information about this charger before making the purchase
im going to return this item its not a bad product i want to be able to charge two batteries at the same time
im going to use two mhs instead
one other thing you cant refresh enele batteries with the mh
the car adapter plug is a plusi have a sony kvhs tv with a  screen size
the device only outputs in one format eg
i or p which is selectable on the back of the unit
if it would instead output the signal it receives in its native format then my tv could choose to convert the signal in a way that is optimal for viewing on that tv
for example if i have i selected on the back of the receiver which is needed to view i hd broadcasts and am trying to receive a i digital signal it will convert the i signal to i
the picture will get displayed in a small window on my screen because the sony sees a i signal and displays it in widescreen format
if the receiver would output the i signal then the tv would be able to display it on the full screenthese cdrs are ok i dont think there as bad as the other people say but they arent too good either
i got a  burn rate which is good
but what makes these bad is that they scratch veryi mean very easily
id say  of my sony discsafter a yearhave some part of the disc top come off
otherwise these are ok i recommened them for people looking for good cdrs for a temporary or short time use
if you are wanting to keep these for a good over a year like music or some computer program then stay away
overall samsung philips and imation are the best ones
oh and avoid maxell they changed their cdrs they are awfulhey systems engineer the reason you cant burn a dvdr is because this burner only burns dvdrrw
you should know to read the specs on hardware you buy
the reason this product is priced  below its dual format brother is because many dvd players wont play back the dvdr formati tried this to  switch between a thin client embedded xp and workstation
the monitor switched fine but the keyboard and mouse  stopped responding
will try a usb based kvm nexti needed a new keyboard and wanted an ergonomic one
however they are a little harder to get used to type on when youve used a standard keyboard for  yearsthis one comes with software that is slightly outdated so i had to download the latest driver
everything works as advertised except the calculator button wants to open the classic os calculator
however adesso is working with me on  getting it resolvedi got this because typing makes my wrists ache
its okay but the keys are cheapish and the layout isnt as nice as a microsoft natural which is what im used to
id really prefer something more along those linesthere arent a lot of ergonomic keyboard choices for the mac so its fortunate that this is an acceptable keyboard
the hot keys are pretty much useless pity theyre not recognized and programmable in usb overdrive
however the angle of the keyboard itself is pleasant enough
after a year the spacebar is a little worse for wear but still works with some vigorous force other keys are fine and im a hard typer who usually wears out a few on any keyboardthe picture is deceptive because there is no string
not that you would want one with the size
this is our second one
we were given our first as a christmas gift a few years ago and adore it
we decided to get a second one now that the kiddos all have their own movies
the one we have had for a few years looks better than the new one though
it is pretty faded but for the price we are keeping it
who needs looks when it functions so beautifully
if the fading bugs you you may want to look at the full priced versions because they are the newer stock
they are also a ton more moneythis is probably a very nice and practical devicehowever my experience in buying two of them they came today gives to pause and wonder about the people who designed the thing
of the two i got one is doa
discgear is pretty famous for this sort of thing
in my case the problem is that presumably in shipping a plastic tooth that is necessary for the cover to stay closed broke off
the carton the two units came in did not show signs of abuse and there was plenty of packing inside
the discgear packaging was not openedthe plastic tooth was broken off and laying loose in the carton
so now i get to file a return claimmy guess is that the problem is that discgear does not securely lock down the cover for transit and that even modest jostling will break the fragile plastic tooth rendering the thing useless junk
i think that if they even secured the cover with a sturdy rubber band this would not happen but they didnt and it diddumb
somebody stopped thinking too soonalso makes you wonder how long the thing will hold up in use
that fragile little plastic tooth should really be a sturdy metal tabthere is nothing spectacular about this drive but nothing particularly bad either
the software they provide does not work correctly with windows xp but aside from that its a good drive to get if you need to upgrade your existing systemspeed  its not going to set any records but its not slow either
it seems to fall in the middle of the pack for performance benchmarks according to the various websites that have evaluated this productnoise  again its not the quietest drive on the market
in fact ive seen other models of maxtor drives that were practically noisefree
this one you can hear slight chattering as it accesses the data but i can barely hear it above the noise of the various cooling fans in my pc
in short you would need to have supersonic hearing to be upset by the noise this one makes but there are quieter drives out thereheat  once again its in the middle of the road
most of the drives out today are generating a lot more heat than the older drives
the reputable hardware testing sites ive checked put this in the middle of the pack
if you have a standard computer case and multiple hard drives most likely there is very little space between them
i would recommend getting a quality ball bearing cooling fan for this and any drive if you want to extend its life but if youre installing it in a cramped space with little airflow then a cooling fan is a necessity due to the heat it generatesquite frankly most of todays drives are quick enough and quiet enough that with the exception of a few performance models its hard to tell any difference between them unless youre a serious computer gearhead
the only areas left to compete are in reliability customer service and software
i havent had to deal with their customer service and obviously i cant rate the reliability of this new purchase but i can comment on the softwarethe drive comes with maxtors maxblast hard drive cloning and utility software
this is the one area that they couldve beat the competition and given me a reason to bump it up to four stars
unfortunately this software proved to be so much a disappointment that id recommend you do not use it
in fact its so bad i should probably should bump this down to two stars
right off the bat i knew i was in trouble as i have a separate promise udma controller built into my asus av motherboard
maxblast couldnt detect it and simply crashed every time i tried booting it in dos mode
dos mode is the preferred and generally less error prone method of cloning an existing hard drive but since i couldnt get it to work that way i attempted cloning my drive running maxblast from windows xp
first off it took over two hours to copy a gb drive over to this one why
secondly maxblast gives you options to set your partitions when youre formatting from scratch but it didnt give me any options to set my partitions when i cloned my existing drive
it forces you to accept one partition thats the same size as your old drive then creates a second partition for the remaining space
not what i wanted
finally i wouldve accepted the previous two annoyances if it wouldve copied xp correctly
it did copy xp and i can boot up but since the transfer i have run into all kinds of problems with explorer crashing frequently the system restore function no longer working and other annoyances
add that ive had to reregister some of my existing programs and its apparent this is definitely not a clone of my old driveso there you go
like the review title says its your basic hard drive with about the same specs as other drives out there
if the price is right and you just need extra storage space its worth buying
however if you need to transfer data from an existing drive plan on paying extra for some cloning software that actually workshope the review helpedif you need to migrate your existing win xp drive to a new maxtor drive forget it if youre counting on the software included
youll need to buy a copy of norton ghostits much quieter than the wd caviars i used to run
not clear yet whether its as fast but the real cost to me was the disastrous maxblaster software which will not perform a copy of your old drive if it has win xp on it
as another reviewer says it hangs  about  hours for an gb transfer
into the copy process
after trying again and again i called maxtor tech support which admitted that you cant do an xp disk copy
they told me to buy separate software to migrate my old drive to the new one
no apology nothing
unlike the other reviewer i spent the better part of  days trying to migrate the old drive which worked fine  i just needed a bigger drive
spent  on norton ghost which did the job flawlessly after i got the settings rightthis seems to be a good drive but its totally misrepresented as a drive that supports xp
if the software cant migrate a good xp drive to this drive then dont claim it can
i have no idea whether wds or anyones included software can do this  but i wasted a lot of time and extra bucks making this drive work
seems like a good drive
but id never trust maxtors claims againcompared to the mx phones i also own these are underwhelming
of course thats to be expected when they are less than a quarter of the price
they sound tinny and washed out arent as loud and the seals on the head arent as good so ambient noise blocking is only mediocrestill for basic headphones at this price they will do the job
i wanted cheap ones for work so that if they were to get stolen it wouldnt be a big deal
i will say the construction seems sturdy
just like the mx they use metal in the headband instead of plastic and they have a nice metal coil around the end of the cable that looks like itll hold up wellthe athms were a great value and sound at the price of  but i had one problem with them which eventually led me to return them
they would hurt my ears wearing them for more than  minutes especially if i am wearing my glasses
they would fit over my ears but still cause discomfort after a few minutes as well as get pretty warm
its really a hit or miss on these so i ended up returning them to amazon
i cannot fully recommend these as a must buy but for the price it is worth a shoti was surprised that there was such a large difference between the athms and the ms
the ms dont seem to be as well made or sturdy as the ms
i did not expect such a big difference
in spite of my disappointment regarding construction i must admit that these headphones sound great
i wear them to cut the grass because the overear design attenuates the sound of the lawnmower
for cutting the grass the cord is much too longsound is good and flat with more bass response than i expected
far superior to everything else ive tried in this price range
the downside is the pressure hurts my ears
after a  hour session it was difficult to sleep as my ears were sore
still sore the next day
ive tried stretching them overnight without lucki cant wear these for more than  hours they didnt make the cushions big enough causing your ears to press constantly on the plastic inside making for sore ears
its been about  weeks since i got these and im just now getting use to it but the pain of the first two weeks is deffinatly something to note as its not discomfort its actual paini bought these headphones about a year ago after a pair of goodsounding cheaply built panasonic headphones fell apart
i was definitely impressed out of the box
the bass response was impressively rich and clear
it was after several days of use that i realized the real quality
i heard things with these headphones that id never heard in songs that id listed to through a myriad of sound producing mediums
unfortunately about a week ago i realized that i must have blown them out
i now receive crackling instead of bass
the highs and mids still remain quite good and for that reason i will hang on to them instead of scrapping them altogether
take note that i seem to do this with a lot of midquality headphones despite the fact i do not use them at excessive volumes
i did use them during a bit of amateur recording which may have been the culprit regardless more than satisfactory while they lasted not so much afterwardthese headphones were too big for my head i have to  tilt them at an odd angle to sit them on my head
they also pinch my ears after wearing them for more than  hours
that being said i use them for doing qa in medical transcription and the sound is superior at least for the spoken word with background noise to help me fill in the blanks
still on the hunt for the perfect pair
all things being equal i prefer earbuds also
these get too hot for me even in degree weatheralthough that is not the earphones fault
i forgot to mention the sound volume is very low i can turn my computer to the max plus the software to the max and still have them on my headthis headphone was featured in san francisco chronicle this week
i was shopping for a replacement for my  yearold sony mdr which was pretty good but was falling aparti came here to amazoncom and read many of the reviews
my take is this is an average headphone appropriately priced though
ill be keeping it because the price was reasonable and i use it during work maybe a couple of hours a day so my needs are simple
my   yearold sony was better imothis is the rd pair and not because they are so great but they work ok for the price
remember you always get what you pay for and if you buy cheaper head phones then you get what you pay forok for the money not too comfortable if youre listening for a while and sound quality is descent coming from my macbook but im sure would sound better if i had a separate headphone amp or daci got these based on the glowing reviews as i was looking for a pair of headphones to wear while watching tv and gaming at night when the family is asleepthe sound is pretty good and very balanced
theyre excellent for dialogue no more wondering what people are saying because the background explosions are too loud
and very clear
theyre a bit lacking in bass and would not be my first choice for music
but theyre good for the pricethe cord is  long which is my viewing distance
i wish it was a bit longer but thats just because i sit farther away from my receiver
others may feel the cord is too long
its a good quality thick cable with a  mm end which plugs into phones and mp players
i use a cheap adapter to make it plug into my receiveri have a rather large head and these cans definitely get uncomfortable after about an hour
theyre pretty light which is nice but squeeze my head a bit too muchoverall they feel quite cheap
theyre very plasticky and do not retain their shape once off your head
the cable only attaches to the left ear so theyre imbalanced weightwise
the ear pads flip over very easily which makes them kind of a pain to just slip on quickly
and they get hot after about an hourtheyre great for noise isolation note  they are not noise canceling as i can barely hear anything else going on around me when i have them onoverall theyre decent cans for the price
if you need a cheap pair of headphones for watching tv at night these should be on your short listmy bose headphones bit the dust and also gave me a blue screen when they blew  brand new expensive laptop scared the heck outta me
i purchased these based on reviews but i must say that my old sony professional studio monitors from my radio talk show these things are about ten years old are much better
i didnt realize staples had headphones available to listen with before purchase
i wouldnt spend money on something you cant actually use for demonstration
there are headphones out there that can cost up to  or more and my daughter had a pair but really the difference in quality with the old sony is negligible although the bose were superior but expensive and constantly blow upthese phones work well with an ipod and if you like bass turn on the bass control on the ipod
nothing refined about the sound in comparison with expensive phones but enjoyable sound on the mellow side
if you use a headphone amp they work better with a tube amp rather than a solid state one in my opinion
im happy with themi bought both of these headphones at the same time not sure of what i wanted
i like bass response but also audio clarity
my review is based off of sound and comfort
ill start with comfort because thats easiestcomforteven the best sounding headphones absolutely suck if they hurt after only  minutes of listening
this is the case i found with the ms vs the xbs
after wearing the ms for about  minutes my ears began to get irritated
i cannot say the same for the xbs
its like the xbs have two pillows resting against your ears
comfort for the xbs scores the ms get a 
i feel like i could sleep in the xbs
they are perhaps the best headphones ive experienced from a comfort standpointsoundsound quality is why we buy headphones
in my opinion the quality of the ms far surpassed the xbsin fact the xbs are already packed up and ready to be shipped back to amazon thank you for the awesome return policy and service amazon
dont stop reading now
the only reason the xbs are going back is because bass isnt my fancy
here are three different songs i listened to in testing the cansti
 whatever you likexb  impressive
if you are a bass junkie these are awesome cans
i like this song but it doesnt have a lot of audio components to it
i selected it because its bass heavy
the xbs definitely won hands down with this trackm  bass response was not bad by any means
the sonys crushed them but they performed pretty well but didnt even come close to hanging with the sonys
again the bass notes hit well but these headphones are made for an all around sound
they got dominated it the bass arenaadele  set fire to the rainxb  this song tells a completely different story
set fire to the rain has a decent bass line but the xbs took it way to far
it was so much so that it was distracting to the lyrics
mids and highs were completely drown out by the bassm  seems like a perfect harmony of highs and lows for these headphones
the bass notes hit but not to heavy
near the end of the song i noticed notes and chords that i have not noticed beforecall of duty  modern warefare xb  i played this with a colleague of mine the day i got both headphones
the xbs were awesome when firing the light machine gun
it somewhat felt like i had the actual gun in my hand because my head was literally felling every shot from the sound
the ambient sound was ok nothing was pronouncedm  i must say i tip my hat to the xbs in this example
i appreciated the response when firing the light machine gun but it was nowhere near the sonys
the highlight with these was the clarity
i could easily pick up on the location of enemies right left front and back of enemies based from the sounds
while i loved firing the light machine gun with the sonys the clarity of the ms gave me a better advantagebottom linethe ms win this battle because they are an excellent value
the xbs will be returned however they are extremely comfortable and a great headphone but the bass was too overpowering
i will most likely return the ms as well because of comfort even though they sound great
im listening to music while writing this review and they are already hurting my ear
sound quality of the ms is greatcomfort not so much for me that isi will be getting a set of vmoda ms headphones not the same price range i know
i havent purchased them yet so look for my review over there shortlyi actually ordered these by mistake confusing them for the noise canceling variety also sold by audiotechnica
that was my mistake so i decided to live with it
i tried to use these on the plane yesterday and it was an abysmal failure
i could barely hear anything coming from my ipad even with the volume turned all the way up
i used them in the house though and they sounded decent
one of the main problems even in the house is the exceedingly long cord that comes attached to them
this thing must be at least  feet
its unwieldyive been using these headphones for about  months now and overall im not satisfied with their performance
i had read through many reviews before purchasing these headphones as there are many varying options in this price range
these seemed to be the best fit for overall valuequality
im unhappy with the overall sound quality as sometimes they make files sound grainy as if the file is of low fidelity
ive tried them with different devices and they have this issue across all of them
i also thought possibly that it was the quality of the files that were causing the issues  so i then cross referenced the files by listening in different bitrates and different file types
it was not the file type that mattered
they are ill equipped at handling very deep bass that i had previously come to know with a competitors headphones
this problem wasnt limited to music files either
for movies it seems the same issues occur
the deeper notes lose their crispness and its distracting
the build quality seems good ive had no problems in this area
the fit and function work well also
perhaps i just got a bad example of this product  but overall  i would recommend buyers look elsewhere in this price rangei would not recommend this product to othersthese headphones are heavy and tiring to wear for extended times
also the sonic quality is just lacking
they are dull
when checking a mix out i put these on and certain frequencies are just not there
ill keep these for an emergency backup but they wont be my go to headphonehowever the price of these headphones meet the quality and why i give it  stars
they are okive been waiting awhile now to write this review since im still unsure what i think of them
they sound very good but not as amazing as some people clame
i am an audio major and have tried many headphones
i would have never went out n bought these my self as they were a present
right now i mix with a  pair of sony which i love
these comparied to the sonys are acatuly not that mad
theyre a nice headphone to get a different perspective on my mix
the ear ear cups are a little shallow so they hurt after awhile
the overal build quality for the price is good
the cord and plug though are fairly cheap and dont look like theyre going to last very long
the cord is way to long and not coiled
if it were a coiled cable i could see it lasting much longer since the coil really helps when the cable is tugged or stepped on
i have also used these for in my vocal booth and they seem to work fine but they do seem to leak quite a bit of sound if turned up to high
not pro quality but still for an everyday consumer you may be able to find somthing a bit more comfortable with a nicer cord and plug for the same pricethe reason i purchased these headphones was because of the great reviews on their sound quality and their price
im no pro but they sound great have a depth of field nice highs and lows and are very comfortable even for long periodshowever the wiring into the headphone connector seems to be a bit shoddy
there is a spring to protect strain etc
but from out of the box if the wire gets bumped or pulled while being plugged in i lose sound in the right ear
i was kinda disappointed
other than the issue with the wiring these deserve  starsi bought these to replace an old pair of koss closed ear sound insulating headphones
they are more comfortable than my old headphones and much lighter
but sadly the sound is nowhere near as good
they lack bass depth and the sound is not detailed
it sounds as if there is a small pillow between my ear and the earpiece
overall the product is okay
the design and build quality is very good
the sound quality while mediocre is acceptable for my main use  listening to tvi bought these to use at my job in the office when i cut soundtracks for fireworks shows
i needed something that would be somewhat noise canceling as we dont have a dedicated studio but i also needed to be able to hear if someone called for me
in that way they cancel just the right amount of background noise out
the sound quality is good albeit a little too much bass for my taste it isnt that there is too little mid and high range those are definitely present the bass is just a little too thumping
i also have to expect my work to be played back on sound systems at stadiums which tend not to have a lot of bass sometimes so it isnt necessarily a true representation for me
however if you are buying them just to listen to your ipod through a good set of headphones these are perfect
they are very comfortable up to a few hours and after that i think just about any headphones would be annoyingi love the audio quality on these
im not an audiophile so wouldnt know exactly how good they are but theyre much better than standard cheap headphonesthe more i wear these though the more uncomfortable they are
ive had these for almost a year now and ive worn them for many hours
a lot of days i will want to wear my headphones for many hours on end
at first it was only a little uncomfortable but now its somehow gotten worse to the point where i almost cant stand to wear them for long periods of time if i dont have tothe cushions completely surround my ear just fine and taking my glasses off does nothing to solve the problem though i havent tested this extensively because i cant see with them off anyway
i think the issue is from the flat part on the inside sorry im not familiar with the terminology pressing against the outer edge of my ear
and its not like my ears stick out but i think a flat hard surface pressing against your ear would hurt
the flat part just isnt far enough away  theres no slope in it to follow the ear back while still being close to the ear
if you look at part that faces your ear from the side it really is very flat looking like it doesnt even try to conform to an ear shape
i think maybe this cold be solved with more padding in the back to lift it away from the ear but i dunnonever tried itfor all my complaining i still like it
it hasnt broken on me yet or gotten onesidesyndrome
my last pair had a very uncomfortable part that rests on your head that kind of dug into your scalp and the top is very comfortable on this one
if you have music playing these block sounds pretty good
the cord is super super long if youre into that mine is coiled and tied up to make it shorter and its still too long but id rather have it too long than too short
ive dropped these a few times and theyre still finei dont know that id recommend this if you want to wear them like you live in them like  hours every day or something  which is pretty much how much i wear them  thought now its painful to wear them after an hour or two but everyone is different and many reviewers like them so its your call i also bought these when they were much cheaper theyre  at the time of this review
i wouldnt buy them again unless i really couldnt find something cheaper with good quality
but i wont get rid of them because theyre still in nice condition and work wellthese headphones are huge
very bulky and the style is more utilitarian than aesthetically pleasing
the real problem was they squeezed my head such that i started to get a headache  minutes in
i wear a large size hat so maybe my head was too big
so i returned themthose flaws aside the sound quality was great and the headphones wellconstructed
i could see them being quite durable in a professional environment where they get banged around a bit
if they hadnt squeezed my brain case so much i would have gladly kept them bulk and allbut it sounds okay
and i have a large head
so beware bigheads
the padding around the ears and crown of your head are insufficienti dont know if the three star rating is fair as i could not wear these headphones for more than a few minutes because they were so tight they gave me a headache
the ear pads were small maybe i have big ears
 which was uncomfortable
the top and bottom of my ear were pressed by the pads
but the worst thing was the feeling that my head was in a vice
the spring steel 
inside the head band was for me extremely tight compressing the head phones the ear pads tightly against my headwhen i had the headphones on i thought the sound quality was very goodafter wearing them for just  hour you ears feel cramped most of the pro headphone cost much more a person needs to try them out before buying to get good ones 
kinda like shoes you need to make sure they fit right i bought this headphone mainly due to its long wire and decent build qualitywhen comparing with my grado sr the lower end of grado products it lags far behind
all music sound very dullthe sound isolation could be betterthe plug is excellent in qualityit is very kids friendlywanted to love these but theyre just not that comfortable especially for extended periods of use
i know nothing about audio quality but they do sound pretty goodi had a sennheiser hd that lasted a few years before they started sounding bad so i got the athmok they are not bad but nothing to get excited over
the fit is acceptable the cord is too long they external sounds good but the main problem is they are not loud enough
also there seems to be a little missing in the sound quality department bass is not deep enough to hear the hit of the drum or explosion in a gamei am no sound technician so i will not try to use big words to describe the highs and lows of these headphones but like i said they are decentoverall satisfied enough to keep them because its not worth what i would have to go through to get a replacementi dont know about professional studio earphones
i bought them on sale and use them to listen to pandora at workprobably says in the description somewheres but i was just too to excited to get these on sale and didnt readthe cord is darn near  ft long
might be good for you but if i want to go for a walk or something i need to roll the whole thing up and put it the front pocket of my pull over
it is about  one foot loops and it feels ridiculousmy ears are kinda big in the vertacle direction uh tall ears i guess
they rest on the top but they are still comfortablei bought the headphones to use it for home recording of some amateur guitar band musicthe sound quality is decent especially considering the rather cheap price however the product is really uncomfortable for mei dont have big ears they are just in the normal range as most peoples ears
the headphones however make a very painful mechanical pressure on them in short timeactually i cant wear them more than  minutes in one session because it become really annoyingthe real problem with the headphones generally that you cant try them usually before you decide to buyi bought these for my wife who uses them when watching television and they serve that purpose well  however i would not recommend them for serious audiophilesi bought new headphones because i thought there was something wrong with them seems its just my computers fault my old mdrvs are definitely better i can hear all the individual sounds these headphones sound flat and like everything is mashed together good deal for  but my decade old sonys are betterim a  picky person when it comes to audio
i have found over the years what the majority will rate as great sound quality usually is not because most people have never experienced truly great sound quality
so the really good stuff doesnt get the most top reviews because it is usually doesnt get the marketing hypeinstead you have to know what to listen for to appreciate it and more often than not the most expensive or most popular item is far from the best
one of my overall tests is when you hear falws in the musicians performances
when you have good sound quality reproduction you often can pick out a slightly muffedup note or a kicked mike stand that you never noticed before
i use known flaws ive found in recordings to check out new gear
with regular quality stuff you will never hear it because the producer didnt mean for you to hear it but with really good stuff there it is
just as if the musician was perfroming right in front of you
if you know audio stuff you know what i am talking abouti bought these headphones for outdoor work
i expect to trash them so i wasnt looking to spend much
i also wasnt expecting superior audio reproduction at this price but some of the reviews were encouraging so i settled on thesethe build quality is ok as mentioned elsewhere the cable is very long
a plus in the old days when your stereo wouldnt fit in your shirt pocket but a little too much by todays standardsthe ear cups are too small in diamenter to completely cover my ears which are of very normal size
that is annoying because they are an over the ear design that is defeated if they wont go over your ears
the foam is comfortable enough nothing fancythe head band is padded and is comfortable with a good range of adjustment
sound isolation is moderate to poorthe highs notes are a little overdone sounding all hiss and sizzle
the lows are a little muddy
the midrange is unremarkablethe net result is an impression of inexpensive headphones which these are
i think they are just fine since i didnt pay much for them but the glowing reviews of their superior sound quality are simply not justified
they are good not great
not even closei would not buy another pair but that is based more on the lack of fit for my ears and the poor sound isolation not the modest sound reproduction quality nor the quite adequate build qulaitypeterhowever set broke in less than  months despite less than average use by an adultdo not recommend look elsewherei only had them on  minutes before my right earthe stickyout onewas hurting
fortunately i had a sheet of  stiff plastic packing foam that id peeled out of some small shipment so i cut two donut shapes the same size as the earcups and slid them under the flap of the existing padding
that doubled the padding and is firm enough that it wont compress
now theyre fine on my ears and i should be able to wear them for a few hours at least
im only giving them  stars because i compared them to my bose noisecancelling ones which i save for when i really need them and they cut out a lot of highrange treble including stuff that you really want to make sure is not in your mix
so they should work fine with the caveat that i need to do a final check with the bose
i wish manufacturers would put in some kind of adjustment for people with wider heads
i will add that the headband is extremely comfortable much better than the bose and thats nice to see in an economy headphonethese headphones are incredibly sharp
sharp sharp sharp
were before burn in
please read full review
leaving at  but these are now  star in my opinion continuing  in modern america there seems to be a high association with good sound quality and its direct association with the upper treble
these phones have no mids
there just not there
i wanted to think it was my equipment so i hooked the headphones into a headphone amp to rule out being under powered
no change
there was sufficient bass decent quality bass this price point as well and extremely sssssssharp treble
sure you can hear detail and yes for this point you have good basebut it leaves so much to be desired from an audiophile standpoint
i know what people are saying above dont listen to those who are complaining and give these headphones a poor rating
i bought the headphones and made the choice to purchase based on the many great reviews
i can see how many are quickly satisfied with them
you have the crip detail and the tight bass but where is the rest of it
the mids are a huge part of the overall sound experience and there not there
im telling you if you are looking for a decent pair of headphones and want mids as well dont look to thesewhat are you planning on using headphones for
do you like to use them by your computer or do you want something to travel
my principle need was for computer listening music and gamingfor only a little more you could get a nice pair of sennheiser s and be blown out of the water
sure there is more sound leakage with the s but i welcome it for audio fidelity
you might also consider the superlux hdb or the audiotechnica athadx
open ended is where im headed
not as much isolation but clarity wise in terms of imaging hearing distinction of instramentation thats where you will find it
here is a good explanation of the two if your brain is having just as much of a headache as mine was in my long headphone search edit  well apparently burn in really does make a difference with headphones
i put the volume on medium and played pink noise out of these for about  hours
not too much above normal listening comfort
now there not nearly as harsh and beginning to sound more balancedbut still not to my liking keep reading
they still lack the mids and the treble drivers themselves still tend to be on the harsh sidebut not nearly as bad as the lazer piercing i lost my inner ear drum harshness that i first heard out of the box the detail in music is coming out more than it was before
ill have to update in this week after the  hour mark with pink noise running every night for  hours at medium volumesedit   two days later mids are finally coming forward
enough for me to rate it a  star at this point
ill still leave it here at three so people can see why i originally put it at three
still a little too strong of a treble emphasis but the detail is also more present now
now the mids are at least there and the treble has calmed itself
they are worth it for around the  dollar price rangethough if your picky and are looking for a higher fidelity consider spending the extra  and going for the kns s
those cans are steller
these will do the trick if your looking for an over the ear headphone that is much better than your iphone or samsung earphonesbut if your looking for something with more mids and truer fidelity i stand behind that while greatly improved with burn in they still have that treble emphasisthough again now my ears are healing from there out of the box stateburn in with headphones is real
pink noise on youtube
run it around listening volumes or slightly higher not unbearable volumes and leave it over night and let it stand
dont run it  hours
every night plug it in and let it go over night
they keep sound in very well when cupped together
i probably have around  hours by this point
so if there is any further improvement i will posti purchased on october    they died about  days agodec   just stopped working
im going to contact audiotechnica and see what their year warranty does
i already know im supposed to pay for return shippingwhich i really dont want to do for a pair of  headphones
i think it would probably just be cheaper for everyone concerned to just send a replacement set of phones rather than spend bench time repairing them and shipping them backbut i dont knowill report back on the warranty experiencethe headphones themselves are ok and not much more
not great audio but for the price not much expected and adequate to the purpose i use them for
relatively comfortable with a long cord which actually is quite handyupdatedecember  i called audio technica and spoke with the warranty department
i wanted to see if they would accommodate me on dropping their requirement for paid return shipping to qualify for warranty service
i told him that i didnt want to invest another  shipping costs on a pair of  phones that had already failed prematurely
before i had even finished he immediately jumped in and said that i could either follow the warranty procedure or not
when i mentioned that i would be reporting my experience on both the purchase and my experience here he blew a gasket and told me that he didnt respond to coercion and went on a minirant without letting me speak at all then hung up the phone
maybe he was having a really bad day or maybe he thinks ats warranty policy is just fine asis
he also seems to be confused about the difference between coercion and negotiationor a consumer standing up and communicating dissatisfaction with their products and their customer serviceim going to check with the ups store on cost of returning but at this point i think the recycling bin or goodwill will get these phones
amazon and other vendors have spoiled me with policies of standing behind products  no questions asked rei is a great example
i wont be purchasing any audio technica products in the futurecc president of audiotechnica corporationupdate ups wants  to ship back which is close to  the cost of the phones so i wont be having them repaired under warranty at this point
if i hear anything back from the company president ill update againupdate february    usps charged  to send back so i did so
theyre back now and seem to be as good as new which is fine if they can make it longer than  year this timebetween the rave reviews and the marked down high price i was expecting a lot better
theres an excess of base and the treble is off
they arent bad enough to return but ive owned much clearer headphones that were much less expensive than these albeit without the muffs
the cable for them is too long a strange problem to have but it really is
if i had got these at best buy or somewhere with convenient returns id probably return them but since its harder to mail them back ill just keep them for nowthese are the cheaper versions of the ms and for good reason sound and comfort are definitely a step down
however they are pretty good and have big bass like the ms without being overpowering
my ears really started overheating though and the ms do not seem to have that problem at all
also the straight cable is waaaaaayy too long
its just ridiculous why anyone would make such a long cable
and its not even removable so you could put in a shorter oneits pretty unfortunate because these actually sound really good i loved the sound but i cant get past the overheating and cable length problems im sending these back
get the ms they are the best ive ever bought
try getting the coiled version if you can theyll be totally worth it thenpros great sound quality adjusts well even for those with larger heads and earscons very uncomfortable after extended useoverall sound quality is good so cant really complain about that
im not that picky regarding sound quality like other reviewersthe one thing that is a little disappointing is the fit over my ear
i think i have a medium sized year and a portion of the foam is always touching the year directly no matter what position its inthe cable tangles a bit because it has no spirals but other than that it works pretty decentlythere isnt a lot to say about a cable
i found this particular one on amazon it wasnt the cheapest but it was from a company i recognized and trusted
it arrived as expected and has worked beautifully ever sinceout of the three that ive ordered from amazon one arrived already broken the plastic clips inside sheared off
its not very quietbefore reading this let me tell you im using a cropped camera for people having full frames you probably are considering more expensive lens and wont have the same problem i have with this lensi got this lens for my canon xti crop factor  which i now understand makes this lens effectively a mm and it is the great lens for the price you pay if you have the original kit lens  without is on my model and then get this you like me will be initially very excited and well introduced to the photography world  i found myself thinking this lens would be my one and only prime and the answer to my low light photos and it is in its way photos are nice better exposed sharper faster focusing and shutter speed i started feeling like a pro which is the reason i got my dslr for right
but then you look at the pictures and realize things you shoot at have to be  feet away and then again indoors shots are almost impossible and cropped because i couldnt walk far enough to get everybody in the picturei have it for three years now and i even though i still love my lens for outdoors i know there are better lens out there  not just faster but better built too i regret not trying them before buying this and for indoors i probably would be better with the mm  in these situations i found myself still preferring to carry the kit lens which is the one i always wanted to change
i did learned how to use it tough and take much better pictures with it nowbottom line if you are in a budget and want to improve your photos without a bigger commitment give this a try just remember this is an entry level and if you have the possibility to try it before buying it consider the situations you are going to use it before buyingits a mm prime
a lens that probably everyone with an slr should have
its crisp and its cheap
its really a great buy
just know that the auto focus on this is unusable and you will resort to leaving it on manual focus after about  minutes
manual focusing isnt a bad option its just something to be aware ofi only used it for a few shots i much perfer my mm pancake lens because it has a great focal lenght and doesnt feel so cheap
i would recommend spending more to get the mm or the mm i have got a bad copy
its a refurbished one from canon usa as i planned to have mm  when it worked its easy to use and the quality of picture was satisfactory
mm and d would work together very well
its more versatile than mm because of  crop factor
however with this copy after about  test shots i got the error message
after its taken off and put back it worked again
then only after a few more shots the problem came back again
this happened with my canon d camera
so i had to return it within  days but its a little pain to deal with canon usa and i had to pay  shipments both delivery and return even for this defective lens
this bad experience has cost me  thats a lot of money for a cheap lens like this
because of mms versatility for crop bodies later i will not get mm  but mm  which has better construction quality and usm and ill stick with amazon from now onthe first time i used this lens was on an eos n shooting ilford hp black and white film
i processed the film in the same tank as other ilford film shot with a leica m and a summicron  lens
after the film dried and i viewed it with a loupe i really couldnt see much difference between the two
the canon was selling for about  at the time
the leica lens was bought used for about while that is impressive optical performance the ef lens is not so great in actual use
there is no distance scaleforget hyperfocal distance
if you dont know what that is you probably should read up on photography
if you should ever need manual focus such as when using hyperfocal distance or the lens is on extension tubes and autofocus is a pia to use there is a rudimentary ring but it offers zero damping and feels like turning a loose bottlecap
its also cheapfeeling plastic from front to back including the mount making it very lightweight but also fairly fragile
quite a few people report this lens being disabled with minor bumpsi havent used this lens in some time
i have an ef  that has good optical performance and has operational features and build quality that are miles ahead of the f model
i keep the cheaper lens around as a spareyou will be wellserved by this lens if you accept the limitations
consider it disposableas a photographer on a budget i bought this lens for  for my canon rebel xs
i use it for portrait photography for babies and weddings and i love it
the  would be better especially in low light but for  i can handle it
paired with an external flash make it even better
i  use a canon ex ii and love the resultsthis is more tuned towards the professional however i feel its good to add my  cents esp
when there are reviews comparing the  to this  some basics first   is much costlier than  about  to  timesnext lens constuction is  for  and  for  elementsgroup
ill cover the importance of this laterbuild quality   is way above in terms of build qualityimportant difference   doesnt have manual focusing   yes wideopen apertures vignetting is more marked in  the colortone in  is slightly better than  bokeh is much more visually appealing than basically in when using dof to an advantage to highlight the focuspoint  produces much more visually applealing photos as the color tone of the outoffocus regions are more appealing and the bokeh is also more rounded than its sibling   primarily due to the larger number of lens elementsif youre primarily buying your first prime lens and you wish to learn to use it without much attention to detail of the photograph from a professional perspective as a possible seller photo then i would recommend to first buy a   learn to use it get exposurecompositionetc
correct and then buy  or even better the best lens in the world of canon  the famous lseries  about not so sure i love this lensi think it was a waste of  money
  i do not see that it works as well as i thought it would  from all of the videos that i watched specifically on this lensi originally left a very favorable review but i was forced to revise my opinions
after minimal use dust has already appeared inside the surface of the lens
theres no way to clean it off
i always use both end caps when the lens is not mounted
i can only think the cause is poor weather sealinggreat pictures and glass but the cheap cost means a cheap build quality no usm and a  blade aperturei started off with the canon   on a ti as my first dslr kit
after moving onto a d mark iii last year i upgraded to the canon   and more recently i upgraded to the canon  l  see my review for that here httpwwwamazoncomreviewrtxmhvjjrefcmcrprpermieutfasinbiyidqlinkcodenodeidtag
because ive never personally used the sigma i can only testify to it on the basis of the many reviews ive read on message boards
ill assume that you know most about this lens already from your research so the question ill aim to answer is whether or not paying more is worth your whilethe   has amazing value to it coming in at 
the next step up requires about  more of your money but here are the reasons why i believe the canon  is worth the extra dough better image quality  no more pentagon shaped bokeh balls ultrasound motor is silent and not distracting  the  motor sounds like a loud mosquito when focusing potentially distracting your subjects you get a distance scale and real time manual focus adjustment  like a real lens the build is much better  it doesnt feel like a toyhere is why going to the sigma   for about  is worth it incredible image quality sharp wide open better than canon  some say it holds it own against the l but ill have to respectfully disagreeand that appears to be it
people complain about sigmas poor autofocus reliability so that makes me think twice about getting it since i do mostly action shotsi think its fair to say that for these three lenses you get what you pay for
the canon   is unbeatable for the price but like most things cheap isnt always good
the image quality is better than say a kit zoom lens and you get a nice wide maximum aperture but compared to some of the other kids its not very impressive apart from the bargain pricei like the lens and id buy it again but i dont know why it didnt come with the typical  year warranty card that most lenses such a my mm do
i am always uncomfortable when i dont get a warranty for something because it usually ends up breaking with my luck
anyway fingers crossed and knock on wood and all that if whoever i bought this from sees this could you perhaps mail me my warranty cardi read the reviews and bought this lens
they were quite accurate
it takes great pictures and is also fragile
i went to a wedding recently and was told not to use a flash during the ceremony using iso 
i used this lens with my canon digital slr and got many great clear shots of the ceremony without using a flash
i could never have done that with my other lenses
while changing lenses this small  mm lens slipped out of my hand and dropped only about  inches and hit the carpeted church floor
it broke in half the entire inner portion of the lens broke out
i immediately thought of the other reviews lol
i did get another one because i like it so much
i suggest you buy it but dont bump itplasticsuper sharp after f attempt f at your own risksmallstubbytoo long on crop body unfortunately  of people who bought this lens probably dont own full frame bodycheapfun to play for a short timenot that expensive even after youre bored with its initial awesomenessdoes what it is supposed to do with no drama
great utility lens for the price
if you need one this is the way to goa few months ago i was looking to expand my lens collection
i chose this lens based upon the price and good reviews
first the price is hard to beat at under 
the pictures taken with this lens are soft wide open but stop it down a little and they sharpen right up
the same thing can be said about lenses costing many times morethat said im not a fan of this lens
the with only  aperture blades boken lights are a weird shape not that nice round shape ive been looking for
the autofocus is loud and sounds like its full of sandif youre an amateur on a limited budget just starting out then this is a fine lens
its sharp and fast
for the more advanced amateur id consider savings for the   and if you have any l series glass id stay away
youre going to be disappointed
for me i just picked up a canon l so ill be selling my nifty fiftywhat can i say that hasnt already been said about this little lens
works great for the money
the only reason im giving it  stars is that the im on my second one because after a year and a half the first one started to give me read errors with my canon d
because i had it for over a year   years canon told me i was on my own and would not repair it for free
tamron on the other hand gives you a  year warranty
but besides that it really does take great photos sharp and crisp and great bokah at  thats why i bought a second copy of it
hopefully ill get a little more time out of this onei do really like having a cheap mm
the ability to have it autofocus on my ti for taking pictures is great
however the glass especially the chromaticabberation in the corners tends to be disappointing wide open
however since i have moved to a bmcc mft and use it mostly for film  i have considered it subpar compared to my rokinon mm f and even a nikon mm with a canon adapter
when you consider the ability to get a cheap but old nikon metal lens for around  and a nikon to ef adapter and possibly get a higher quality image wide open  then this lens doesnt seem quite as nifty as it once wasas others have stated this lens will yield very nice sharp images
if you buy it make sure you also get a lens hood for outdoor shooting otherwise expect all of your pictures to have lens flaresunfortunately i dropped my lens less than  weeks after receiving it
the drop was only  feet onto notsoplush carpeting but it was enough force to crack the casing in half
it is a bit sad that the glass on this lens is stronger than the plastic casing protecting it
fortunately american express insurance company is covering the damage
i definitely recommend buying this with a credit card so you too can get that  day coverage
more so i recommend finding something a bit more sturdy even if it is a bit more expensivei work in video production and we use a canon mm f lens on a c for interviews
i own this lens the f and use it on a d for stills
my walk about lens is the mm f l but its big and heavy
if i want to have a smaller profile this is the lens i choose
the build quality is fine and the performance is excellent for the price
for anyone who bought a canon dslr with one of the cheap kit zooms this lens is a mustthis is a thrifty fifty not the nifty fiftygood optics clarity and fast autofocus with the eosm for most users it will probably be a good lensi give it  stars because the infinity focus stop is incorrect and it is difficult to focus manually
the maf switch works fine but it goes past focus and into blur very quickly and before the focus ring hits the stop
just the slightest bit of a turn is needed to get it out or infocus and this makes a really sharp shot difficult with larger aperture settingseverybody goes on and on and on about this lens as if it were the greatest thing since sliced bread
i dont regret investing the  bucks i paid for it but im not particularly impressed
in fact it rarely comes out of my bag
some things to considera mm focal length on a cropped sensor dslr is the equivalent of mm actually slightly more on a full frame camera
i simply dont care for mm lenses and find that i constantly have to move around to get the shot i really want to take
i usually have to back up which may not always be convenient or possiblein most instances using this lens wide open at f will deliver lessthanhopedfor results
at that aperture only a small area of the image will be reasonably sharp while everything else is soft in the extreme
this lens has to be stopped down to at least f or f to give even marginally acceptable results
in dark conditions the loss of extra light caused by using smaller apertures will require compensation via a higher iso andor a slower shutter speed which in turn may cause further loss of sharpness due to inevitable camera shakethose who have not used a f lens may think theyll be able to shoot in near complete darkness
not so
if you have a decent amount of ambient light from brightly lit streets eg
you can get by but youll be forced to rely on a very wide aperture with the consequent lack of sharpness discussed above
otherwise youll end up using a flash unit which generally defeats the primary purpose of a fast lenswho should buy the canon mm f then
indoor photographers who want that dreamy creamy soft focus look in their images and who are not at all troubled by the lack of sharpness delivered at large apertures and street shooters or photojournalists who want an inexpensive lens to use when they must get the shot and for whatever reason cannot or do not want to use a flash
im in the latter category which is the sole reason i bought this lens
i regard it more of an emergency tool than anything one which will give me an occasional shot which i otherwise would not have captured even though i may not like the resultant product very muchan afterthought i also own the canon mm f pancake lens which i greatly prefer to the nifty fifty
for me a mm lens is far more usable than a mm and the f is super sharp even wide open
no stopping down is required with this lens which makes it eminently more practical than the mm fyeah it is sharp and cheap
but cheap plastic feel lack of a good manual focus ring that can be easily grabbed and turned no markings for focus distance slow auto focus and a basic fast fstop been making it since the s leave me disappointed
i cant believe the rating is so high for an obvious cheap basic item for a reasonable price
save the big stars for the actually good products and give this thing the mediocre rating it deservesas a price and quality is very good excellentthis lens is not good for slrs with high cropping factor like mine canon eos d or digital rebel xt which is  the photo looks zoomed and if you want to capture something with wider angle is a problembut if you want to shoot portraits good choiceim a graphic artist and i just start to do photography just for fun of it i got this lens basically so i can have not blurry pictures of my always running children
 i did wanted a fast lensit is a great price for sure the lens it self feel a little cheap but it work like a champ now i been getting better result with the manual focus the auto focus never get what im aiming for
may be set up of the camera not sure
i own a canon xsi rebel and compared with the other lens mm this one make the pictures look more professional the depth that you can get is very nice the color contrast is great and for indoor pictures is very very good not to fan of flash lights so the f stop really helpi already have taken nice christmas pictures with this lens and im sure with all the emotion of opening present ill catch all that craziness in a sharp wayif you are like me this lens is great to add to your collection portrait pictures is the strength here now if you are a prowell you will not be reading this for sureyes its a great deal but if youre investing in this because youre into the details of the hobby youll quickly see why the mm  is better in every way
like most lenses both mms are not at full sharpness wide open and the  just gets sharper faster at any aperture
and if youre buying this for speed and pretty much most are then youre looking to dabble in the art of depth of field
the  again simply does this much better with smoother bokah blur in the out of focus areas
it took me a while to realize that all those little pentagons in the s bokah where due to the bargain  blade aperture and made me realize why i needed to belly up for  the   of course all those things are even better with the  but for my money the  is really the sweet spot of priceperformance in the lineup
your mileage may varythe lens is good for what it is
cost effective lens in a pinch
you can take great pictures with it like most lenes
a long as you dont mind moving around
was  looking for something a but more wide angle than this one is
the kit lens for  the d can do what this does and a little more
if you bought a camera body only though this lens will get you going on the cheapive gotten some awesome pictures with this lens
i would recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive new lens for some great picturesi am an amateur  photographer
i have purchased this lens hoping that it will give me sharp pictures and make nice bokeh at the same timehowever i have to say that when using a wide aperture f  photos are soft in the center
corners are noticeably  softened
bokeh is ok in this settings thoughi have to stop down till f to get acceptably sharp pictures
taking many pictures i noticed that this lens performs best at f regarding its sharpness but i lost bokeh effect significantly
so i could not find a sweet spot for getting good result for bothadditionally if you dont use high shutter speeds shooting handheld you will get blurry pictures because of no image stabilization feature of this lensalso focus is hunting at wide f aperture sometimes and lens makes annoying noiseoverall  i am not really satisfied with this lensyou get what you pay for and its a shame lenses can be so expensive
anyhow dont expect much
i use this for my ti about a  split between photos and video
as for video the focal length means you have to be a ways back from your subject to capture it
of course this is also due to the lack of zoom
works rather well for photos but the depth of field is a bit limiting leaving you with many an unusable shotthis lens can be had for a third of a mm f so on that note maybe it is a great lens
however it struggled to focus and oftentimes we would flip through pictures and realize that they were not even truly focused
it is possible that i just got a bad lens but others have had similar experiences
we upgraded to the  and never looked back
sure the  would be cool but can someone please lend me the money
this  in a normal setting might be ok but it is all plastic and not up to anything that might lack in light or be quick movingi have not yet met anyone who uses this lens that have not broken one i am one of the many
canon must have hired engineers to create a lens that is guaranteed to break
this thing is like a house of cards beware of breathing on it with fear and trembling well try not to tremble use manual focus or put on a lens cap or allow the camera to hang around your neck
it must be plastic the width of a strand of hair that holds this thing together
so yeah just treat it like a newborn baby never one careless moment or else its head will fall out and youll be out a 
some reviews mentioned the front part fell out while taking pictures right after buying it they did not even bump it
of course canon would not honor the warranty
anything that happens will be your fault even if you did not abuse it
but yeah with that aside look at me i got another one
it takes wonderful photos i think it focuses faster then the more expensive mm  that i borrowed from a friendmake no mistake this is a cheap lens
the auto focus is barely functional and the lens is very light
that said it is an inexpensive way to achieve low light performance and shallow depthoffield effects
it should also be a good portrait lens when used with an apsc sensor dslr
just be prepared to use manual focus most of the timethis lens has an attractive price
it is light weight and performs ok  if the available light is good enough or i am using strobes i would prefer to use the ef  f
if i find myself needing a fast mm ill look at the ef  f or ef  f
those last lenses are a little more pricey so this lens has its place for surei can take the same pictures with this lens as i could with the mm lens that came with my camera
i thought it would be nice to have a fixed lens but i was incorrecti enjoyed the lens but i decided to return it and upgrade to the mm f which is the lens i always use
i am glad that i decided to upgrade to the better oneeveryone knows this lens
if youre looking for a mm prime you know there are  choices from canon
the almighty   or this 
the  is a natural buy especially for beginners bc its so affordable
prices usually fluctuate from im using a tid
my views of this lens for what i use it for which is indoor shooting with available light wide open at  is not terribly sharp
but the shutter speed gain is great plus i dont have to boost iso as much its extremely cheaply made
really this thing is all plastic feels very hollow and feels like a toy
its also a bit big compared to some other  out there ie minoltas excellent 
i would not be surprised if you found lots of dust and debris inside after awhile af is very slow and noisy
sometimes it will hunt for  seconds before finally locking or sometimes it will not lock at all
at a recent housewarming party i had to use it in manual bc the af just simply refused to lock in the majority of the shots
this is very annoyingbut what do you expect for  right
so as long as you can keep the expectations vs pricepoint reality check in line i think youll get great use out of this lens
for how i use this lens i find the focal length too long for indoors where im taking photos of people
i find myself hitting the walls after having backed up so much
looking now for a lens in the mm range but i need to prepare myself to pay a lot moreim an amateur photographer who happens to take a heck of a lot of photos and i bought this lens to use on my canon eos rebel dslr cameraim not too terribly happy with this lens but i did not expect the moon for 
on auto focus it never quits jerking back and forth and settle down to a firm focus unless youre in full sunlight
even in full sunlight it can take its sweet time to focus
it feels flimsy   poorly made
but again for 
ive since turned the auto focus off and just use manual focus all the timei dont know if the lens is a lemon or if all of them would turn out the same way if i replaced it
i think it probably the latter
other than that i ordered the lens for portraits and it takes very sharp  clear photos
maybe too sharp as ive had complaints that every blemish or wrinkle in the face shows up in the photo
i like the wide aperture setting for blowing the backgrounds out behind the subject but care has to be taken that you have enough depth of field set so all of your subject shows up clearlywith all that said im still happy for now that i ordered the lens and that i have it in my bag
if the auto  focus worked as it should i would probably give it another star or two in the rating
if i happen to break this lens somehow i will probably just put together another two hundred dollars or so and order the ef  mm f ive been waiting for getting this lens since last years christmas
since i am from venezuela it isnt easy to find this stuff at a reasonable price out here
ive read lots of reviews
the ones who praised the lens for being a bargain and the ones who said that it was crapit surely isnt crap at all i dont think it looks like a toy the construction is ok although i havent tried it like it should so i cant say much about the image quality just that the autofocus is lame
theres one thing that i have to say and that pretty annoys me it is the fact that it has moving parts in the outside of the lens when it is in autofocus mode that creates lots of opportunities for the lens to be damaged by any bad movement or something like that
as an owner of a mm f i thought that it had a similar system when being in auto focus the ring is simply for decoration so you cant do anything in that moment
well im an amateur and theres maybe another review about it or theres a group called i really like canon efmm f because it has moving parts outside but well that whats i thinksome of my favorite photos were taken with this lens
on a crop sensor camera this becomes a killer portrait lens and the price is right
but ive gone through two of them already and am now considering investing in the  version
flimsy construction doesnt just mean broken parts
ive babied these lenses and they still end up with dust and other mystery crud inside
my last lens actually grew mold something ive never had a problem with other amateur and semipro nonsealed lenses in my collection which i attribute to the obvious gaps in the fit and finish
i would view this lens as a musthave for outfitting an amateur or travel rig but if you go into it thinking of this lens as disposable you wont be upset when it gets inevitably ruinedthis is a great little lens with a tragic ironic flaw
for all its wonderful image quality and ability to gobble up light its almost completely worthless in even slightly dim lighting due to the terrible low light focus performance
ive come to think of it as a manual focus lens its so bad
and without a flash there is no focus assits lamp
now i may be the problem here perhaps there is a way to utilize the focus assist lamp without using the flash
if anyone can correct me on this please do so
id love to be proven wrong on this as i really love everything else about this lensi have been waiting a long time to get this lens and was very excited when it arrived
however it has an occlusion inside the lens so i will be sending it backi bought this lens for doing portrait work as well as food styling in studio and wide open artistic type shots
received it in  days as amazon promised brand new in the box
at first view i will agree it is a cheap built lens well for  i dont know of a lens that would be built to survive a war
im not really into ef series lenses on a crop sensor i tend to strange shots as well as really high up in the fstops there is insane curvature weird angels strange light on the low end ff ish you can really kill the background and control how much it does it want it all out f literally i took  pictures focusing on each stair the back ground stepped out as i desired
the middle fstops im not sure how i feel its a weird view 
artistically its an incredible lens of insane control
the sharpness contrast color rendition is literally the best lens i have ever owned i was looking on the camera in a raw editor and was like why is that there its ghosting i put it in aperture there to i zoomed in cause the wrinkle was in the shot before any lens probably would not have seen it 
skin humans are not perfect with this lens be ready to learn how to remove blemishessmooth rough spots incredible
i took this lens and my efs  lens lens and took a few shots on each i am stunned almost everything i do is good 
this is not a total darknessnight time shooter lens 
night dark is my specialty and the camera super hunts for a spot to focus on a cheep zoom i have works way better when it gets a shot like daytime studio its awesome
the thing i hate is it is so loud like crazy loud there is no sneaking up with this one so its not good for some things and unbelievable for others i was thinking this would be great if it were like my pentax smc  mm on film but it a totally different lens and the optics rock 
i am going have to learn how to use it i am getting great shots but they are not how i imagine them in my minds eye
i say for  go for it its a super art lens and is incredible on people which in  feet away  i know i am gona have huge fun with this one it brings out the special in stuff i call it the model maker buy this lensit seems everyone loves this little lens
it does have some nice features like f
it produces some nice bokeh but it has drawbacksfirst all of my other glass is canon l  so that may be my issue
the build quality is just low
it makes lots of noise and hunts for focus especially on the canon d mark iii
maybe it is all those auto focus points
i feel like i hooked a robot from the s to my camera
it makes all this noise as it goes in and out for focus
it is annoying
the second annoying thing is the screw on lens hood
every other lens attaches via a  turn with a click
you can also store the hoods backwards
it protects the lens and keeps your bag neat
you cant put the hood on backwards on the mm f
you just have to put it in the bag and hope it doesnt break or worse yet break something else or scratch somethingi know what everyone is thinking
its only a  lens
i understand that but i have had lower price lenses before and they felt better than this
i may buy the mm f and see how that feels
there may be a mm f on ebay soon
mineif i get the f i will update this review with some comparisonsi am going to be frank
the af misses most of the time and produces soft photographs
sometimes the lens quite autofocusing for some reason
when you press the button half way it makes a little noise nudges a little and stops
the lens is pretty soft wideopen closing down to f makes the images much sharper
its not extremely soft but its not the sharpest
a plastic mountbody is not very desirable in the world of slr photography but for  you are definitely compromising key features
for the price its a great lens
however in general its not a great lens
if you are on a tight budget and do not have semiprofessional expectations this would be a great lens for you
you get a lot more back for your buck with the f version
a usm motor faster in low light  and sharper  and better build are the main advantages with the f
for the money its not badi initially gave this lens  stars but am now moving it down to long story short while the lens certainly is a fantastic value and should be part of any beginning photographers kit it has some shortcomings that become annoying over timefirst off it is flimsy and will break easily
you probably know this by now though
another issue is focusing
it is slow to focus and will hunt until eternity in dark light
lastly it is very small
this might not be a problem for some but when you put it no a large body or a a body with a grip attached it becomes very uncomfortable to holdimage quality is still good as well as color rendition if youre getting weird colors learn how to use your cameras white balance settings
it is sharp even at f though it shines when you stop down a bitlastly bokeh is ok i liked it at first but compared to other primes the bokeh is pretty dulli bought this lens for   years ago and the price has been hiked since
if youre looking for a good prime and have a little extra cash id recommend canons mm f insteadsome picture turn out good other are just ok not as spectacular as advertised
for a hundred bucks i guess i will keep iti have used this lens as an inexpensive alternative to a good zoom but it really gives marginal increase in width plus distorts the edges and at the widest angle blocks the corners viewitem came in on time and in brand new conditionthis is a mediocre lens at best
it is very soft wide open
the bokeh is terrible both wide open and stopped down a bit  blades
color and contrast are mediocre as well
the worst part is the af
it is very inconsistent even in good lightthis lens is very popular among beginners and there was time when it offered much better image quality compared to the old  kit lens for crop bodies
not so much anymore because the  is is so much better than the old kit
the  can still be useful stopped at least at f and it takes super sharp pictures at f when it focuses well almost never
with a crop body in a typical scene f has enough dof to mask the poor af
more experienced users will be frustrated howeverwas excited to get this lowprice prime lens based on the raving reviews and the assurance that the mm normal prime is ideal for so many situationshowever i suspect most of us who are buying the lowprice lens also have the lowerprice dslr bodies with the cropped apsc sensor
i have the eos d which has the cropped sensor and found that mm isnt such a great allaround lens
with the x magnification provided by the apsc sensor mm is a telephoto lens instead of a normal lens
you really want a mm lens to get the lens everyone raves about
i ended up purchasing a mm lens from sigma and it is great with my camera
the mm hasnt been used once since the mm was added to the camera bagso much dust gets in behind the front element i hate how it focuses so loudly
but its  bucks so i cant complainthe canon  proudly wears a lot of praise and to a large degree i concur
it is the cheapest canon lens at under  yet it has nearly equal or sometimes superior optical quality than a good chunk of the canon line
as such its a quick route to very good photo quality
it has several notable flaws which one has to expect for such a steal of a price
still they add up depending on the type of photography you do and may constitute grounds for shifting to this lenss pricier faster versionspros very lightweight reasonably compact accurate af though see cons afmf switch on body onaxis picture contrast at most apertures is quite close to the  and  costing x and x the price of the  chromatic aberration is very low to the point of nonexistent at all apertures macro photography using macro rings is quite possible and fairly pleasing with this lens so long as you are able to very carefully nudge the undamped mf ring or you have a handcrank macro stand or railcons the af fruitlessly hunts in low light despite the wide f aperture  this is the kind of hopeless hunting that the cheapest kit lenses do bzzt brrr bzzzzzt chukkachukka brr bzzzt the af is noticeably noisier than that of for instance the l this is not a big surprise at all but its worth noting for photographers who want a very quiet lens the mf ring is cheap and undamped which results in a major loss of functionality for astrophotography see other thoughts for more the lens body lacks outer threads for the lens hood which necessitates affixing a lens hood to the filter ring the bayonet body mount is plastic not metalother thoughtsits hard to ding this lenss picture quality
in virtually every test resolution ghosting flare vignetting it compares quite favorably to canon and aftermarket lenses costing much more
chromatic aberration is essentially absent something that the  and  simply cant claim
its contrast however does not beat those two lenses at all
for budding photographers who need an inexpensive first lens that easily outperforms the quality of a kit lens this is a fine choice
theres a reason the  used to be a pretty standard kit lens option with most slrs
youll eventually notice some things about it that you wish it didnt do or did better but by then youll be looking at dropping some money on other lenses entirelyfor astrophotographers looking for a cheap way into the fast lens market keep looking you have not found the lens at all
the mf ring has no damping and thus the manual microadjusting necessary for perfect focus is highly unreliable and essentially impossible
af in starlight simply does not work and thus you either have to focus in daylight and not bump the lens ever and must set your shutter release to not execute af first before shooting or you may get af off the moon or you have to electronically focus using onboard software such as magic lantern or bring a laptop and use a canon or aftermarket software title
in several ways its a nowin frustrationgenerator and i cannot recommend this lens for astropix at allfor portrait photographers on a budget you will likely notice a few issues with this lens but be surprised at how good it is and how in medium to bright light it does quite well
it is very light making your camera easy to handle for hours at a time and you get a little exercise because you have to walk instead of zoomgood for the money
not well build but does the work if you are just looking for the first prime lenesvery cheaply made plastic
actually got stuck on my canon ti and i had to wrench it off which messed the lens upi have had this lens for  year now
i know that  is not much to spend on a lens but i would think twice before buying this lens againon the positive side if the lens focuses properly you get very sharp amazing images  even at f
my problem with this lens is that this is a very big ifi have a canon xsi camera
with the lens set to f there is a very shallow depth of field
combine this with the lens problem of normally frontfocusing ie
if you focus at an object  inches away it will probably focus at  or  and you have an outoffocus pictureafter having this lens for almost a year and reading that this is a very common problem with this lens i sent it back to canon for this problem
they agreed with me and replaced a large part of the lens assembly
since i have received it back it works slightly better
i have just finished running some tests on a tripod and set to  about  of my pictures are out of focus because it focused incorrectly
at f this drops to about so if you do buy this lens be prepared that  you might have to send it back to canon for repairs
even if it works fine expect limited usability out of it at f
plan to shoot at f or higher
at lower f stops plan to shoot many pictures to get some that are goodi am not sure if this issues is worse with my model of camera
i have no reason the believe that my cameras is any better or worse than any of the other rebel series cameras
if you have a d or some other much better camera with a much better focusing mechanism then perhaps you will have better luck
but then again if you are going to spend  on a d body wouldnt you buy a much better built lensafter reading many reviews on this lensi thought it would be just what i needed for my first prime lens
i am an amateur new to the slr world and was going for the  fstop for indoors and try to save money till i learn the ropes
this lens is truly worth every pennybut even to my untrained eyesit is lacking even compared with the  that came with my d
it does feel like it might have came from walmarti like walmartand i think its worth having one in your bag if you are a beginner like me or on a tight budgetthis unit has thousands of reviews so im not going to belabor the point with another huge review but i do have a few observations
im sure theyre far from unique
 images do seem sharp though no more so than any other lens i have pricepoint is crazy cheap lens is light but probably because its plastic
somehow i didnt quite expect a canon lens to feel quite so chintzy
time will tell if it turns out to be useful or not
 focus is fast but really noisy
this may be the noisiest lens ive got
i wont be creeping up behind any woodland creatures with this thingok thats first impressions
more as experience with the lens increasesnice cheap lens but as every other review has mentioned its loud as crap and very very cheaply made
the glass is good and it takes some very nice portraits but dont be upset if it falls apart after a few months of normal useif you want a prime lens and dont want to spend a lot of money then maybe this is a decent choice
it can help you capture some good pictures
but it can also help you produce poor pictures just as often
next time id spend a little more money and forgo this cheap lens despite its attractively low pricein no particular order here are my likes  dislikes followed by a summary of my recommendationlikes it is very inexpensive with the right combination of photographer light natural elements and pure luck youll get some good photos out of it it is light weight this is also a dislike  see belowdislikes it is very cheaply made construction does not seem durable at all focusing is slow and noisy it is especially slow in lower light obviously despite best efforts it seems to produce just as many poor images as it does good images colors are not as vibrant as id likei guess the summation of my review has to come down to your needs and your wallet
this lens can serve some people well under the correct scenarios
so here are some questions i recommend you ask yourself before buying can you afford a more expensive  mm prime lens
if so then maybe pass on this one
 will it see very infrequent use
if so then why spend more
 do you expect it to get banged around during an extended outdoor trip
if so then this one might make sense because it is easily replaced due to its low cost
 are you learning photography as a hobby and want to practice with a prime lens
if so then this is a great choice
 do you demand a lens which can reliably produce very good or better images most of the time and provide vibrant eyepopping colors most of the time
if so then this is not a great choicewishing you best of luck in your decision
let me know if i can answer any questionsmay be i got a bad copy of this but the manufacturing quality seems to be a hit or miss
search on google for erratic focusing or forward focusing you will see lots of people complainingf is practically unusable for me as it is way too soft
one thing i use this lens for making videos
i manually focus so there is no autofocus error
they come out good as expected from a f lensso for photography it is a absolute nothe mmf and mmf are the best portrait lenses that canon offers
i own a canon rebel  and digital rebel xt and have used both these lenses for several months
pictures have been outstanding and my professional customers frequently cite the sharpness light balance depth of field color reproduction and bokeh intentional blurring of background in portraits from these lenses
some people question the usefulness of a mm lens on digital slrs with a x crop factor ie mm lens  mm on a dslr like the digital rebel xt i can vouch that the range is beautiful and relevant focusing more closely on key subjects in portraitswhat do these lenses have in common
they are both fast the f is blazing fast  dslr can hardly keep up
 details are incredibly sharp you can see individual hair strands virtually no chromatic color aberration no dithering or shadows in the corners focusing is rapid and quiet thanks to canons patented ultrasonic usm technology and photo quality parallels even my professional canon l lenses
these fixed aperture lenses also provide superior pictures than telephoto lenses at mm because of better glass and aspherical elementshow are these lenses different
having tested both lenses across  pictures there are  key factors that make the f superior justifying the  price tag faster especially in low light extra fstop makes the f better for indoor photos or low light
great companion to the ex flash
i was able to take nearly  picsmin with flash and the fastest sandisk gb ultra ii cf card no chromatic aberration whereas the f has slight yellowing of photos under certain lighting conditions or where edge definition is low full automanual focusing range f requires flipping between auto and manual using a switch while f can be manually hot focusedtweaked after auto focusing superior build quality  the f is plastic and feels cheap like it might fall apart anytime
the f is metal weighty and is for the proud lens owner cleaner bokeh  f produces beautiful blurring of background in portraits bokeh while the f leaves less clean edges
canon reviews suggest this is due to the f having  lens elements vs  elements for the fwhich lens should you buy
this is a question of utility vs value
the f costs over  while the f can be acquired for under 
the f will last forever while the f will probably break under normal use in a year
does this justify the x price tag
if you are a budding photographer looking for a play lens then the f will more than overdeliver
if you are a photo enthusiast who looks for the perfect shot you will want the f because it surpasses every expectation and so youre not left wondering what if
if you are a photo professional you already have the f lens among your bag and are not reading this reviewi needed a fast prime to shoot available light in a gym using my digital rebel in iso mode
the lens is really quite good even wide open but since its not a usm ring motor you do have to excercise a little more care when you take it on and off the camera or screw filters onto itthe type of motor in this lens is fragile and sensitive to too much torque being put on the focus ring puts stress on the motor parts
forums advise you to switch to manual focus when putting the lens on or off the camera or installing filters or hoods to avoid moving that front focus ring too much while doing sothe build of this lens is el cheapo plastic
there is no full time manual focus with this lens
i find that when shooting vertically that the lens sometimes has a hard time auto focusing i belive the term is backfocusing when shooting heavy action its almost better to leave it in manual mode
im sure this was put out there for the photo schools to provide a cheap lens for their studentsdont get me wrong its a good lens for the price but dont expect it to stand up to a lot of heavy useso i pick this lens because it was much more easier on my pocket book then the  f i kinda wish i would have ponyed up the cash and bought that one but i bought this one the pics are good great glass fast and great depth of field but i just cannot get over the plastic feels like an egg in my hand im afraid im going to break it however for the price it is a fantastic lens a great buy just treat it carefuly also the auto focus seems to hunt around for a bit and is pretty loud it is an old style motor so what could you expect all and all it ia an ok lens and lives on my camera most of the time but when it breaks ill get the  f  but for the price i could not say no this lens has great performance for the money but it has an allplastic body and feels cheap
even the mounting bayonet is plastic and may loosen over time if you often swap it out on the camerai never use this lens
ever
its faster than the mm but its extra size the loudness of the focusing element etc makes it pretty useless for me
i use the mm pancake all the time
i used this maybe  shoots
been in the drawer ever sinceanyone want to buy mine usedits ok not what i had hoped for the lens works well but you are very limited on shots
its at best okfirst of all my star rating explained  stars initial rating  star today rating equals  stars for this current review
yes for  you get some great image quality
i bought this lens  years ago for photography classes and for the most part ive been pleasedas a cheap f it was the goto lens for low light situations
that said it is pretty terrible at autofocusing in low light
but again its only  rightthe lens feels very cheap and light but i didnt mind the build quality much and assumed anyone who was breaking the lens was too hard on this nonpro equipment
well i opened my camera bag this morning to find the front element of the lens detached from the body
the rear element fell off as well
this lens was sitting in my bag on a shelf and i didnt notice anything wrong when i placed the lens in my bag after my last time using itmaybe i wasnt quite gentle enough when i placed the bag on the shelf
or maybe the lens reached its expiration date and selfdestructed
not sure but ive been planning to upgrade to the f anyway so amazon watch for my order soonlooking back  years if i were to purchase an initial mm again i would skip the junk and go for the f and i suggest the same for anyone considering these lenses
if you buy the f you will end up paying more eventuallyeither for repairs andor replacement or for the inevitable upgrade to the fgood quality pictures in low lightproblemsauto focusing  it has a weaker motor so focusing is slowe
constantly looking for adjusting pointsgoodprice is good
good quality picture atmy experience is not goodi read here that people can shoot it wide and get sharp imagesi have to shoot above f to get anything sharpand the worst part is i have to resort to using contrast detect live view all the timephase detect or ovf in automode renders all pictures blurryreply from canon support is next to nonhelpfulim not sure i want to invest another  in a better lens right nowgood in low light it work well for a cheap lens
i would recommend it as a fair low light lensits not a terrible lens but its just not a star wonder lens that people seem to make this out to be maybe i got a bad lens
ive taken many photos with this  other lenses that i own and the quality just isnt there primarily i use a sigma mm dc os macro hsm f   and even taking indoor photos under low light conditions the sigma runs away with it the photos from the canon lens mm f ii look ok from a distance but if you start looking at the details the coloring doesnt look at accurate and the details look washed out whereas the sigma seems to portray the objects more accurately and with better definition i will say i think this lens is better than the default canon mm lens that came with the ti i purchasedlens caps were not oemalthough amazon display implies that they were
although they do fit the lens they are even more easily dislodged than the already substandard oem e lens caps which is a low hurdle indeed
only positive comment is that the replacement price better matches the poor quality of the replacement compared to thecanons very overpriced originals by a factor of x even with care bordering on the paranoid  i have managed to have  caps lost with only weekend usage over an  month period
and that refers to the original poorly designed canon caps
dont expect much protection from these replacements eitherfollowup i was immediately contacted by the vendor fivestarexperience after this negative review with an offered postagepaid refund for the items if returned  or simple credit for order minus sh
this is a very inexpensive product not worth the trouble to do either
but the offer did change my opinionestimation of the vendor
thank you
id recommend the vendor and would use again
my review of all e lens caps and pricing is rather glum howeverthis is a complex evaluation that mixes both product quality as advertised and vendorso draw your own conclusion product   vendor  the waist belt stowed in the rear pushes the case inwards so the camera body has to be forced in
if the waist belt is out it would work fine even with an  lens
very little room for anything else other than the camera and the front pocket only just has space for a spare batteryi find the waist band in its little compartment takes up too much room from the inner camera department
when you keep the thick long waist band folded up in its compartment it bulges over into the inner compartment meant for the camera and takes room and even presents an obstruction
who but large tourists even use this beltband
the belt band is not removable but permanently an integral part of the bag unlike the more useful yet removable and adjustable shoulder band which will get slung back and forth in use and relies on cheap plastic hooksthe bottom of the inner camera compartment is also marked with a small piece of fabric attached to the sides with velcro but is hard to set in correctly and flat
and what can you hide under that flat bottoman extra pocket shaped for lens filters and caps apparentlythis will only hold my camera with the telephoto lens attached it is too small to hold a second smaller lens
i have not found it as useful as i had hopedmain complaint is that although it is bulky it has little customization potential
unless you have a small camera or say a pancake lens attached there is little to no room left for anything in this
also the outside zipper pocket is only useable for either a lens cloth or a single filter
nor is there a place to put your contact information
pretty much a very basic bag with limited flexibilitythe issue i have with this bag is that if you have a battery grip on your camera it a very very tight fit
its a well but together bag but its not setup for a camera with a battery grip on itbuild quality and design are not greatthe zipper head inside the top cover may leave scratch on the back of the camera  could have been just a velcro
it looks huge from outside for a holster style but not enough useful space inside for rebel xsi  a lot of  thick dead space around the camera and lens not very useful for storing accessories
could have had more storage pockets outside and shrunk the bag a little bit
a bucklestrap might be used to the top cover instead of velcrosome of above issues my be solved by putting camera strap first then the camera body and lens
however the design color texture and size all remind me of military equipment not camera  even with a canon logoi am returning it and will pick one at a local camera store after carefully evaluating the design inside and outel tejido del estuche estaacute muy bien fabricado y puede resistir al menos una lluvia ligera
no ofrece un gran acolchado contra los golpes fuertes pero la caacutemara estaacute suficientemente protegida para condiciones de transporte normal y no muy agresivo

esto no solo es fastidioso sino que puede llegar a ser peligroso
ahora se abre hasta  centiacutemetros con solo el movimiento del cuerpo al caminar
por ello he bajado la calificacioacutenthe bag is not that bad but the little pocket zipper would unhook itself when you are walking  aprox
this is annoying and risky of coursethis thing apart the bag have a good size for an canon rebel or nikon dxxxx camera with an up to  zoom lens with some extras like  battery memories a filter or body cap watch out for the self commanded zipperthe fabric tissue is tight enough so it can handle small amount of water and dust but the pad is barely sufficientto keep the equip knock safe
it have a removable shoulder belt and a fix hidden in a special pocket waist beltit was nice and cheap but it emits a squeaking sound when i walk
didnt think it would be a big deal but when you are walking around in nature the squeaking kind of ruins the sceneit is good for the regular lens but you cant use it with the telephoto lenses i wish it is a bit longer then it is a perfect case i wish it has attachment holder for the telephoto lens or the regular lens on the side of the case design problemthis bag is much bigger than i expected but just isnt quite roomy enough to comfortably hold a mm canon eos rebel ti with a battery grip hand strap and small lens attached
it just doesnt seem to be designed with the optional standard canon battery grips and hand straps in mind
the bag is attractive however and appears sturdy and wellpadded but its bulk some of which is from the rear pouch storing the belt strap when not in use can also make it a bit awkward
its not a bad camera bag for the price but you may want to consider something else if you plan on using a battery grippost script  this bag turns out to be a pretty good fit for the canon rebel xt with the caveat that youll only be able to fit the one zoom lens and no other lenses or a flash unit
even with the xts smaller size however the bag is still a too tight of a fit for an xt with a battery grip attachedthe old batteries i tried to charge must simply have been too old
bought the eneloop charger instead and amazon is being very good in quickly delivering itthe eneloop charger couldntwouldnt  charge my old batteries either
so i guess ill just begin using the new batteries insteadthank you amazonafter a couple bad experiences with digipower and their battery chargers they sent me the dps as a replacement for my older dps unit
this item came with four   mah aa nimh  batteries
a nice break from their older chargers this one comes with an adapter and a nice long power cable so you no longer need to find a free wall outlet to completely cover with your charger
the unit will charge either aa or aaa batteries and either two  or four  at a time
it also features an automatic trickle charge feature so batteries remain topped off with no danger of over charging
its relatively speedy at charging batteries
it is compact enough to fit on the corner of your desk or anywhere convenient
and it doesnt get all that hot like their older chargers used to
i keep two batteries fresh in the charger and two batteries in my camera at all times and it seems to work well for me
all in all its a good charger for the money
although digipowers customer support leaves something to be desired long contact delays misread emails etc
theyre willing to back their products fullyso far charges great and for the price you cant beat itcurrently mine has an issue is after it finishes charging
there are two lights on the charger
one for power red one for status green
the green light is supposed to stop flashing when they are done charging but mine the green light just turns offi have contacted the manuf and waiting their response
in all fairness i just emailed them minutes prior to writing this reviewso well just have to see what happensrick kthe charger is very quick to charge the battery but the battery does not last game i expected in a year and stopped working
buy a sony cycle energy batteries with which im using the charger and it works greatwell i ordered this combo in december  because they were on a promotion with the canon sx is and in those time i did not know anything about chargers  batteries so i finished with  dps chargers including  batteries each plus  aditional  mah batteries
let me talk apart about the charger and batteries
the dps charger after  years of use is yet ok review edited  years later on december  the charging time is as advertised some   hours for a set of  batteries it worked well with their own batteries brand as with the  sanyo eneloop  ray o vac hybrid and  duracell all  mah i should buy later
a good point is you can use it in the house or the car
the digipower batteries quality is another story of the  batteries i get the  that come alone lost the charge within  days just on the begining so i should throw them away asking by mail to digipower i never had an answer
the second set that come with a charger lost the charge in  days after  months of use and of course i throw away them too
the third set that also come with a charger are the best and kept the charge for about a full month just after  month of use and i throw away this set too
i use them in a digital concepts afc flash and give the longest  recovery time expected at full power with recent charged batteries
the sanyo eneloop and another rayovac hybrid work totally different they kept the charge between  and  month
