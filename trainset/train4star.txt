tape is fine still much waste with the way the printer works unless one does continuous printingi got hooked on the brother ptouch label maker at work and even though i could borrow it occasionally for home use and not have to pay for the label tape which is expensive i got sick of not having it at hand to print a label on the spur of the moment which is how you want to be able to print labels
i bought what seems to be a topoftheline unit which prints on several tape widths our last machine only printed on  tape and i really like having recourse to this wider labeling tape which allows more room for clearly printing information such as name tags with address etci have an older brother machine which specifies the tz tapes
when i received my order it was the newer tze tapes and i was concerned they would not fit
but alas they are fine
however if you have a newer machine i understand the older tz tapes will not work because the newer machines have an extra post in the tape area
not sure about that since i dont have a newer machine
but i will tell you the new tze tapes work fine in the older models
i use the white on black tape to name the various buttons on tvs receivers etc
that are too small to read otherwiseit is a label that goes in a brother label printer and it works not much else to say so ill tell you why it is special background sticker
special thermal paper
clear plasticthe thermal print head creates the letters behind the plastic  it does not print the letters like a normal printer and this is why the letters dont rub off
brilliant idea that no other label maker to my knowledge doesconsthe labels are expensive and i have never found and aftermarket generic alternativeive had this flash about a month now
ive been pretty happy with it and it does everything i need to do with an off camera flash
great priceim going to briefly describe my level of photography before i dive into this review to put this into context if you dont care about context just skip to the next paragraph
ive been into photography for two years
during that time ive been bitten by the shutterbug as they say and ive devoted myself to photography pouring over dozens of books thousands of articles and countless images learning the art
im relatively new to strobist photography i got an sb for christmas and since then ive fallen in love with offcamera flash
this vivitar  hv is my second flash unit
the camera i primarily use is a nikon dreviewits clear this flash is from a different era the instruction manual is copyright  
at one point in the instruction manual it says something the long the lines of try shooting a roll of film to experiment with this feature
as such there is no ittlettl
gasp youll actually have to decide the proper exposure for yourself
as my technique improves and i gain more experience with offcamera flash i noticed that i relied less and less on the sbs ttl capabilities
id shoot manual at the camera and manual on the flashas i said before this flash is old but it feels like a workhorse in your hands
with a solid build and sturdy mounts ive read reviews of people who have been using a vivitar  hv for  years and it keeps slugging awaythe power of this cheap flash is incredibly powerful
ive done an experiment comparing the flash output of the sb to the vivitar hv and i must say im quite impressed please see this link for the test  its pretty clear that with the extra  youd drop for an sb youre paying for the optical slave and the fancy ittl electronics
buy this flashhey this flash it is so powerfull it is good to use to make jobs outside and it is not heavy
you can use on the canon rebel xsdalso you can buy an extra battery holder and four aaa to aa battery holder converter and make some wiring and use an external battery vdclead acid and have a better recicling times like  seconds using the full power of the flash against the  with the normal four aa batteries
and with the lowest power you can shot continously like  times without problems
with this add this flash can work all the night and take more than  shotscons
if you need to take fast pictures with it mounted on  the camera shoe you need to adjust it every time  because it does not have ttl circuit and you can burn the pictures
and for this reason it is better to buy the ttl flash of your camera to avoid this kind of situation on fast moments taking pictures like the kiss on the wedding ceremonybut for the rest it is a good flashi do recomend itoverall a really good flash for beginners and experienced photographers alike
if youre used to an automatic flash this may not be the best option for you as everything is controlled by the user
however if you would like to learn more about flash photography especially offcamera lighting you cant beat the value of this unitworks great
good buy
found it with you at a great price
i would recommend it to others who have the needi could only give this vivitar four stars because it does everything very well but it takes a lot of practice to learn how to use it well
once one learns how to use it it is a really useful allround flash and a good addition to a multiflash system
considering the price well worth itthe flash works great
its simple and basic in function but has everything i need to shoot on and off camera
i hardly use on camera flash unless i want or need to and primarily use it off camera with a shoot throughbounce umbrella
i plan on buying another one to set up with a large soft box
its plenty powerful for a variety of occasions
as a mobile set up and until i get strobes these will work fineto start out this is the second one of these flashes that i have purchased in the last couple of years
my first one  years old is still going strong and has seen a lot of use and some abuse   on the downside the plastic shoe mount is worrying but has not given me any issues to date and i do use this on light stands and with triggers that attach to the shoe mount
this flash is also best used in full manual mode with settings to full half quarter and  power
it would be very nice if the settings would go lower and  would be awesome and i would never buy another type of flash   to overcome this you can buy very cheap nd gels that slip right into the slot and provide a power reduction but be cautioned firing off shots too quickly while gels are in place as i have melted a couple this way
as far as the good news goes these flashes are extremely powerful for the price you pay and they just plain work
my much more expensive sb will often times go into to sleep mode and not fire the first time i push the triggerthis guy will fire every time
the only downside to this availability is battery lifekeep batteries on hand and dont expect to be able to use rechargeablesfor me they work but not for long at all
overall if you understand and accept the the limitations of this flash it will be an awesome piece of equipment for you
if you come in expecting full functionality of much pricier units you will be disappointedexcellent as a backup flash
you must be aware that it is hard to have anyone honor the warranty since apparently vivitar is no longer in business
if that concerns you go with the real mccoy and get a brand name flashthis is a great economical flash for the amatuer photo enthusiest
i found it a little difficult to figure out but once i did it became my favorite accessory
i use it with a canon ti and my photos are great
i recommend that a diffuser be purchased along with the flash
i purchased an opteka sb mini universal studio soft box flash diffuser and it works great
just be careful not to drop
i unfortunately did this and had several pieces fall off
luckily all but one snapped right back in place
the other was a silver disc that was super glued on the side opposite the manual computer
i put it back with a much better glue
the flash still works great with only a couple scratchessure this flash doesnt have all the bells and whistles that a modern namebrand speedlight would have
you dont get ttl and you cant swivel the tophowever if you are into offcamera strobist type of lighting this is a nice cheap flash to use for your secondary flashesrealize of course there are only  powerlevels on fullmanual
full   and 
there are no inbetweens if you want to vary the output on your subject you either move the flash head inout or you shoot into a neutral density filter to reduce the output
either method works fine
i also think its rather weird that there is no  power but again if you have a stop neutral density filter this is easily achieved without moving the flashthis flash does have a highpitched whine to it that does not go away when its fully charged
its not loud and annoying but you can hear it if you listen hard enoughoverall this is a good flash that puts out lots of light
i have heard reports that the newer models being manufactured in china are not built quite as tough as the first release so you might do well to pick one up used rather than new
these things are built like a brick and the older vivitar s are still working after  years so that will tell you what type of quality this brand hasi have to say that for the price this is a very good unit and depending on how you intend to use it this can be a great purchase
for me there were two separate dealbreakers which forced me to return this in favor of a lumopro   these may not be dealbreakers for you though but i wanted to mention them here since nothing in the descriptions here made these two issues apparent prior to ordering the opening of the flash head is large which is not necessarily a bad thing
however if you plan to use the largest size roguebender unit in a wraparoundtoformasnoot mode or to use the rogue grid set this is a problem
it is just too big for that the sync port is a proprietary connector
dealbreaker for sure
you cant use your normal connectorscables from your existing radio trigger units
the cables or adapters from pocket wizard are  each which degrades the bargain status of this unit quite a bit
plus you have to carry and keep track of separate special cablesconnectorsfor my specific purpose mixing this in with studio lights as a small noot or grid spot these were deal breakers
if your use is more general these are probably stlll a good deal they will fill an umbrella nicely and they work nicely enough on the hotshoe
they feel sturdy
the wide angle adapter is okay but is a separate piece that slides in not attached to the light so it is another loose item to keep track of or losefor my specific purpose this simply is too much hassle and wont play with the modifiers i want to use
ymmvi had a change jar where i collect all my change
by the time i dumped it i had 
i went to a coinstar and to avoid the coinstar tax got an amazon receipt
with the money i got this flash
it is very affordable obviously and there is a reason
the majority of the adjustments you need to use yourself
call me inexperienced but i still cant figure out how the calculator on the side works
but nonetheless i get excellent results
the light fill is equivalent to any canon speedlite
the reason again for the vivitars relatively cheap price is because most of its controls are manual where the speedlite is automatic
but this can be a good thing
if you are looking to your first flash this is a good candidate
with its lack of automatic control the user can learn how the amounts of light can affect a photo
it is a good learning experience and i have learned a lot
this being my first external flashthe build quality comes across as cheap
possibly a  out of  it is made in japan good quality camera equipment usually comes from there
if its made in china stay away
the foot is made of plastic so one drop will probably break it
so just be careful when handling it
it uses  aa batteries
it says not to use rechargeable but i do and it works fine with no ill effects
it comes with a slidein diffuser
lets just say im getting a better one for christmas
i have also heard these make great satellite flash units because they are plentiful and cheap
the vivitar hv is not damaging to the camera because there is no high voltage feedbacka bit of my background for credibilitys sake
i own a canon sxis and photography has been a hobby for around  months now
i realize i have a point and shoot and should have a dslr
but i do not have a lot of money and wish to pursue photography more
so for now i use a high end point and shoot
i have submitted my photos to many places including my university
many of my photos have been published in news articles
probably just because i have my camera all the time so i get rare shotseditit has been  years since i wrote this review
this particular unit still works
the plastic foot i worn out at this point though
the lock doesnt do anything
i am now a professional photographer and own three vivitar hvs
they are still my light of choice as they are very easy to use
i use them in my portable studio with umbrellas
the k bulb temperature makes it very easy to white balance
it is only k off from natural sunlight k
the vivitar hv has held up to the test of time
this only confirms that this flash is a great productsince i last posted my camera i have upgraded to a canon d and dthe film is excellent becuase it is fuji filmhowever the company is promoting the film as super hq speed and it is not
it is regular  speed film when it arrives
i was given a full refund and was told to keep the productthought i was buying a higher grade of fuji but it is plain
still fuji is good and you cant buy it across the counter anymore so i am just glad to have itas a professional audio engineer and an amateur photographer i take many pictures at concertskodak is good but never comes out very colourful and the generics just plain suckfuji film really brings out all the coloured lightsthe oversaturation of colour is great but sometimes unwantedagfa is good all around film with excellent sharpness but tends to be expensivefuji film rulesmy main reason for preferring this film is because as far as color goes this is rich color with a reasonably high iso
im not really that worried about grain since thats part of the draw of shooting film nowadays at least it is for mewhen i shoot on film i use a pentax me super without a flash hence why i use iso  since when im at f i can shoot comfortably in a reasonably well lit room
and when im shooting on overcast days this film still keeps the pictures looking goodthe final reason that this is most often in my camera if im not shooting kodak bwoocn is because its affordable and readily available
fuji makes great film and this is a solid performer for general usemy only concern is that ive had some issues with the film being to tight and it some rolls have been a little hard to load or to catch on the winder its simply harder to pull out of the cassette
half of that is user error but it seems like i have to try more often to get this film to catch in the mechanism and in an point and shoot camera you probably wont notice if the film isnt actually advancing
just be careful loading and it should all go smoothlyim not sure if you can still purchase aps cameras but if you have one film is hard to come by
they dont even sell it at the drug stores
if you use it i would say stock up no because with reduced demand and the fall of kodak it could suffer the same fate as betamaxwhile my grandchildren havent used them yet because they are disappointed that they are not digital i know that will enjoy the picture that take later this week when i kind of force them to use them while swimming
they really dont appreciate that they are waterproofwhat else can you say
its the same disposable superwideanglelens  iso cameras you used for years before digital cameras but waterproofif you are needing a waterproof camera and want to get it for a great price
i strongly recommend purchasing this  packno leak issues and all  cameras worked well
the developed film largely came out well but a couple were unintelligible
the cameras were purchased for our trip to the bahamas
the strap is like a rubber band and winding and snapping pictures is a breeze
next underwater trip i take i will be purchasing more of thesethe rubber band is apparently a handle
i inadvertently tossed it out when i opened it to look at it
then the next day i saw the hole on the side and thought  oh that is a bracelet handle
duhit was very good
took alot of pixs  the beach  resorts  didnt have to worry about it getting weti tried several cameras on a recent dive trip including a kodak and a fuji disposable waterproof cameraneither camera has a flash which means that everything will come out in shades of blue under water unless you bring your own lightneither camera leaked which gave them an edge over more expensive professional cameras on this tripboth the kodak and fuji look very similar with a sealed plastic case with slight positive buoyancy and thick rubberbands for securing to a wrist or clipping to a bcdi have to give the edge to the fuji in terms of both design and results
the fuji was easier to wind and to snap shots with and the pictures came out sharper
the  film in the kodak produced shots that were way too grainyid give it  stars if they added a flash and a bigger viewfinderthis product is cheap and you get cheap pictures
my wife and i used these cameras to take underwater pictures of sharks
they came out a bit grainy but you can still make out the shark details
i was overall ok with the camera because you get what you pay for
i was expecting high def pictures and i didnt get themi bought this for my first snorkeling trip
i didnt take many pictures and my foggy snorkel mask made it a bit difficult but i did get a few very clear good shotsi would buy this again if i went snorkelingconditions midafternoon sunny coral reefs in bermuda water too deep to stand but not that deep reefs sometimes pretty much at eye leveli used this camera on the beach quite a bit last month and it performed just as i hoped it would
i swam with it a few times and it survived the submersion with flying colors even floating to the top a few times when it slipped out of my pocket
i wasnt diving or anything but for submersion within  feet of the surface it did fine
cant speak to deeper usei didnt use the camera to take underwater pics but it did fine with pictures above water when wet
the resolution is obviously a far cry from what you can get with even the cheapest digital camera now so you should go in aware that these arent museumquality prints or anything
but for what it is this camera does finei also highly recommend buying the camera from amazon
theyre not paying me to say this or anything but i looked at local drugstores and the exact same camera was literally  times as expensive
i cant for the life of me figure out why the markup is so high but thats what it is in the washington dc areawhat can you say about a tape
they are going the way of the dodo bird but i still use them until i can no longer find themthey work for memany people are complaining here about damaged tapes
i have used these tapes for years and have never had a problem
however i dont ever buy tapes online only in a store
i fear that tapes will get wrecked during shipment so i prefer to get them at a store
the tapes are good when you get a good batch
i have tapes that i recorded years ago some as far back as  and even earlier and they still play almost perfectly now
its a little more pricey to get them in a store versus on the internet but you will have a better chance of getting good tapes so its worth itthis is a nice bag to keep a compact dslr in
it has just enough room for my d camera and strap in the main section while a spare battery and lens pen is in the outside pocket
it is tight to fit the strap in however it feels secure in the case
i would have to get a larger one if i upgrade my lens over the  i have nowi feel the cushioning is quite good for the bag and it is just great for a person who wants to travel lightfits the canon ti no problem
pouch under the lid will hold memory cards and the small extras
outside pouch is very roomy
strap is a little stiff but i think it will work in over time
the low price makes this an excellent buyi couldnt use it d  mm vr but its pretty effective and minimalist as id like and would be ideal with some of the kit lenses on a nikon dvery good camera bag my canon xsi feets perfectly
maybe it should have more pockets
but its very good for tourist travelingnicely padded room for a couple filters and extra film
compact and great for carrying
caution
leave it zipped because if you pick up this bag opened your camera will fall outthis tlz mini bag is well built and has a large front pocket
however there are no pouches inside the front pocket to permit better arrangement of batteries and memory cards
because of this design oversight i returned this bag and purchased thelowepro rezo tlz  digital camera case gadget baginstead
the tlz  has a smaller front pocket but inside the pocket there are two pouches
note however that the tlz  will not accomodate as long a lens as will the tlz minithe pentax kx and pentax slrs in general are small
with the  lens and lens cap  filter on this mini camera bag is a tight fit
you cant really use the inside pocket in the lid because it makes the compartment even smallerpros compact well padded great pricecons i question the use of a zipper on the x lid flap even though its covered with a quartersized leather flap
its just one more thing that can scratch your viewfinder over time
most of the star deduction is due to the poor implementation of this storage feature hard to get my kx camera in it in a hurry
the camera strap needs to be carefully put in around the edges of the camera for the top lid to close  its hard to avoid scratching the viewfinder with parts of the strap for the kx only the outside pocket of the holster is useful not the lid pocketgiven the small size mostly height of this holster bag  for arguably the smallest slr camera  it seems this bag was designed  and is more suitable for  the superzoom  slrlike style cameras that are generally not as tall from lens to viewfinderthis is a great bag for a nottooexpensive slr if your camera fits with the caveat of that semiexposed internal zipper
i wouldnt put a  or up camera in itupdate   i decided to move up one size larger to thelowepro topload zoom  camera bag blackbag
the specs say its  taller and a bit wider than the mini
but having both sidebyside and because both are wedgeshaped the zoom  is noticeably wider and taller than the minithe result  the zoom  has at least  spare room at the top with my pentax kx inside w lens and at least  more  sidetoside for the camera strap
ahhhalso the lowepro zoom  bag has   removable inside velcrod straps at the top of the bag to stabilize the camera position
the lowepro mini does notthe velcro strap feature makes the zoom  a much better choice than the mini for securing your midpriced slr and is worth the extra buck or two over the minii have owned the mini version of this case for my olympus e for about three years now and have not have any issues with it so i though id buy this full sized version for my recently purchased canon d and i am happy to report that it fits the canon nicely
with the kit lens  the d has a little wiggle room on both sides and about half an inch form the back of the camera to the top of the bag
by folding the ds strap up behind the camera it fills that extra space nicelythis is not the case to get if you like to travel with a lot of accessories and lenses though since there is not much room left when you put a camera like the d in it
it has a small pouch on the underside of the cover perfect for a compact flash card or two and another larger pouch on the front of the case
the larger pouch can hold the charger a cable or two and a few more compact flash cards
the case also includes two little velcro dividers to section it off if your camera is significantly smaller than the casethe case is nicely constructed and can stand up to an occasional sprinkle of water
the padding is not very thick but works well for minor impactsthe one thing i dont like about the case is the new shoulder strap
on the older mini version the ends of the shoulder strap were sown down
on the new one you get extra material hanging off the strap if you shorten it
not only does this extra material get in the way but also the strap is a bit less secureall in all the prefect case for a larger semipro slr canon d and d and nikon ds but a bit too big for consumer level slrs canon rebel and nikon dthis is a great little bag
my nikon fits lens down in it and there is just enough room around the edges and top to squeeze my tamrac strap in as well
for the most part i dont attach any straps to the bag and just carry it by the handle
since its inexpensive i also purchased the chest strap which holds the bag snug against your chest but makes it very easy to retrieve the camera without removing the strap
although ive testfitted the chest strap i havent taken it on a hike yet so i dont know if ill like it or noti held back a star probably unfairly because the fabric of the bag seems a bit thin and unexceptional
i dont think this is a performance issue at all  i just would have preferred something thicker and more tactile like ballistic nylonstrongsamlland a few pocketsnicei have a nikon d and mm lensthe bag works greatgreat bag lives up to lowepros rep but simply too small for a d wgrip
the camera with no grip and a mm prime just barely fit
no way would it take a longer zoom
adding insult to injury no room for a flash in the acc
pocket
mine is going back
would be a great solution for someone with a smaller camera thoughim a somewhat new and budding amateur photographer and to go along with my canon xsi rebel d i decided to pick up the lowepro topload zoom  tlz camera bagfor those who dont like reading long reviews ill say it upfrontthis bag was exactly what i expected it to be
i bought my xsi with the kit mm is lens and the camera body with lens attached fit perfectly
the bag is not too large to carry around and easy enough to open
it holds the basic accessoriesextra battery extra sd card lens pen and even my user manualim new and always curious about the settings in my technology so occasionally ill use it as a quick referencei do like the design of opening away from the bodythis allows a bit easier access since the flap falls away from you
this keeps the bag open a bit better when trying to fish around though i dont really keep anything in the main compartment other than the cameralens so theres rarely any fishing to be done therethe size of the side compartment is nice and since it has small pockets within the zippered compartment you can organize a bit more neatly if you have a system
usedfull batterymemory cards on one side empty on the other etc
its never that tough to access either since its in the side that faces away from the body when strapped on the shouldermy one problem with this bag is in the interior main compartment
i do own another lowepro bag and inside the main compartments of both are small subspaces for memory cards etc
in my other lowepro bag made for more carrying space the subcompartments are velcro and there is a microfiber cloth that can be lain across the top of the camera to prevent scratches to the screen if the camera is positioned in a vertical orientation and the lcd is facing upward
this bag on the other hand has a zippered compartment with no microfiber cloth
in the closed position this zipper is covered by a small flap that should prevent scratches but i am just slightly uneasy about it because if i forget to zip it all the way closed the zipper may be loose enough to scratch
also the actual material of this subcompartment makes me a little nervousits relatively soft but it doesnt take much to scratch or scuff lcd screens if pressure is added so i am a bit more cautious when using this bag
still the interior does feature two velcro pieces which can be moved in order to properly support your camera inside the bag which is always a nice feature to have even if you rarely or never adjust themthe only other minor gripe i have with this bag is that the strap leaves a bit to be desired
its a bit thin and the padded section isnt that well padded
however since this bag is of a smaller variety you probably wont be carrying as much weight so it may not feel too harsh on your shoulder
on a long hot day however it may become a bit of an irritation
im considering swapping the strap for another since its relatively easy to do
note also im somewhat new to dslrs so im still adjusting to the weight of the camera in the first place
after time this strap irritation might go away just from becoming accustomed to the cameras weight in general
but again the strap is a minor gripe since you can replace it with ease for not too much moneyi would like to note that larger lenses may be a problem for this bag
in trying to fit my new canon mm  is lens in the bag attached to the camera it is simply too long for the bag
the bag may be able to squeeze closed but it wouldnt be something im comfortable doing with such an expensive piece of equipment
i would expect anything an inch or two shorter would be fine but my lens even when taking up the least space possible fully retracted simply will not fit
however this is made to be a more compact bag so it was to be expected and this does not detract from its overall uselooking for a great little camera bag for a reasonable price
this is it
lots of room for your camera and the extras
easy access and easy to carry around without being in the way
good protection for any of your mid sized digital slr cameras or smaller models with room to spare
ive had lots of camera bags for much more   but this does the same job for a great price
cant go too wrong with this item
buy one and save yourself the time and trouble of looking at more expensive bags that arent any betterrcb  oceanside caooops
amazon is the place to go for this itemi have a d and this bag is perfect for it and few extra itemsworth the pricethe texture of the bag is soft and not that hard core materialmake sure your lens is under  otherwise there might be a good chance that it wont fitother than that it is an excellent bagthis is a great little on the go camera bag for my pentax kd
the bag is a little oversized but i figured a general bag for all cameras would not result in a snug fit
the sides are pretty thick and shock absorbant
that was my biggest concern was that the bag could take a few minor bumps and not damage the camera
it has a few nice little pockets for the extras and a decent sized outside pocket although not big enough for a lenscould hold a cell phone small wallet car keys etc
i can hardly wait for winter to end so i can take my camera on a hike and get some good picsmy sony a camera with mm lens fit into this bag easily
this camera bag is smaller enough so you can carry another bag with additional lens together
i do not want people look at me as news person so the plain look is ok for megood in all respects for a rebel  sized dslr wextra lens but only one review mentions this there are no pockets whatsoeverso sdcf cards lens tissue whatever must find a place elsewhere eg an outboard lens case
this is a shame as it would have been so easy to include a zippered top or front pocket
other than than its fineok in an attempt to find the perfect backpack i ordered this one lowepro mini trekker aw the tamrac expedition  and the kata r
i ran them through their paces and guess what i found
none of them had everything i wanted
that being said i settled on the lowepro
details belowbackpacks in generalthe bottom linesimply put it seems that its nearly impossible to find a backpack that combines comfort with capacity
the kata r was by far the most comfortable study backpack of the  but was handsdown the smallest pack spacewise
there was hardly any room for manuals my d manual and sb flash manual bulged the one pocket and very little storage for trinkets it all fell loose
the lowepro and tamrac packs had ample room but were only semicomfortable on my back compared to the kata
so i had to decide between capacity and comfort
since i really want a carry everything pack the lowepro won out being cheaper when compared to tamrac and having a better fit on my back the loweprothe goodof the three only the lowepro was configured in a way that you could carry two ready cameras
of course all  would carry a second body and lens but not assembled
the lowepro has room at the bottom for a second camera pointing toward the top of the packthe lowepro has the best noncamera storage system with a system of mini slots and pouches for things like pdas ipods books etc
the tamrac had this but it was one big compartment where they would all jostle around
the katas was nonexistent literallythe lowepro and kata both have a true weatherproof cover but the lowepro stores it away in a builtin pouch in the bottom instead of taking up a lens slot like the kata which is already spacelimitedthe lowepro is the cheapest of the three always a plusthe badnot much bad that i can see aside from the fact that its not the most comfortable of the three but it certainly beats out the tamrac which was the least comfortable of the three for methe uglyof the  the lowepro has by far the worst tripod carrying system
sure the hideaway tripod puch is nice but the supplied system of elastic rope is flimsy and seems to have been included as an afterthought
the compression straps can be crossed and hooked to the wrong side as a fix but one shouldnt need to fix anything at these pricesi decided on the lowepro as i said above because i wanted a carry everything bag that would fit on my back
what i get is a nice gadget bag that fits comfortably on my back for a run through the airport
i do not have a backpack however that would work for a severalhour hike
i have a pack thats good for the state fair so i have what i need and my wife can fit a few things she picks up as well
it will not be good for a daytrek through paris
then again if im hiking in the woods or sightseeing through paris do i really want everything camerarelated on my back
probably not
im more likely to carry a small slingfannypack for the camera a zoom lens and maybe a flashwhen all was said and done the lowepro struck the best balance of comfort and space
space management was best in the one and comfort was second only to the kata which i preferred most of the three but lost out because of severe space restrictionsbottom line youre not gonna be satisfied with what you get   at this price range none of the backpacks serve up everything my dad and brother who are also amateur photogs agree
the lowepro will however serve your immediate needs and save you a few bucks to investigate other options
its sturdy and wears well for short periods of time maybe an hour or two tops and will defintely carry everything you might for a twocamera system assuming you can share secondary lenses between the twohope this helpsps i have no clue why this pack is showing up as unavailable on amazon at the moment
oddi looked at literally dozens of possible bags and finally settled on this one because of a special need
i dont have a lot of camera equipment but what i do have is somewhat unusual
i needed a bag to carry a recently acquired fuji gsw iii mediumformat camera along with my rollei qzw rangefinder and a few miscellaneous extras such as a pentax spotmeter for the fuji extra  mm and  mm film my little fuji tiara aps point and shoot camera extra batteries and so on
this is every piece of camera equipment that i own but it fits nicely inside this small backpackstyle bagthe fuji is a fairly large camera although it isnt that heavy since its mostly polycarbamate plastic
but its allmanualit doesnt even have an internal light meterhence the need for a spotmeter
this odd assemblage makes for an awkward arrangement in most camera bags but the backpack format works great
after rearranging the internal dividers i had something that fit perfectly and wasnt that bulky
the only complaint i have is that the backstraps arent detachable but this isnt a big deal
allin all an excellent choice for someone who needs to do some customizing on the bag interior to suit a special needi actually use the canon eg photo backpack and its about the same as this lowepro but for a lot less money
sure its not quite as well made and sturdy as this lowepro but its also not nearly as expensive
while i wouldnt really hesitate to buy this lowepro especially if it were a bit cheaper im very happy with the canon backpack as i get nearly the same functionality minus the builtin all weather sheath for a lot lessa note about the layouti like this style photo backpack better than the type where the camera gear is placed in the bottom of the pack and the top part is for other items
this style is more space efficientit can hold more lenses and photo gear in the main compartment yet the outside dimensions of the bag are less
granted you do have to take the pack off and set it down to access it
but i tried a tamrac backpack the kind where the camera stuff goes in the bottom part of the pack before buying the canon one and i found it way too big and not any more convenient to use as i had to also remove that one from my back to access it
in the end the canon pack and this lowepro holds extra stuff too
in the flap pocket i can fit a shirt light lunch and other items like a magazine
in fact i can even fit a small laptop in the main compartment in a separate laptop slipcase for protection
i would say a  laptop would fit fine but not a  or larger oneif you want something that you can work out of without having to take it off and yet carries all of your photo gear i doubt you will ever find it
i would instead recommend a shoulder bag that you carry only one or two lenses in for weight reasons for walking around with and a back pack for transporting all your stuff
i also use the backpack for long walkshikes and it works fine not fully loaded too
in other words just because you can take every single photo item you own doesnt mean you have to or shouldweighs in at only kg
nice quality construction
infinitely adjustable leg length
i combined with with a gorillapod with ballhead and bubble level
the ballhead is transferrable so i can use it on this velbon as wellits a nice little tool but you cannot do movements for video work what i mean is the tripods head is very basic and camera movements are not easily obtained other wise the mini tripod is great for its purpose its  durable and can hold your digital slr with big lenses with no problem at all i got it for my ti  it is perfect for the low angle shooting  i use it only for video work there is a major missing element and that is the balance indicator you have to balance the camera visually looking forward to using this on vacation
the tripod is very sturdy and is great for the pricei love how it compacts down to a foot  fits in a suitcase great
supports my d with l quite wellto make it betterallow alternative heads  a ballhead would be much better for photo workuse better clamps
the leg clamps are the cheapest part on it  and i would have liked to see better plastic used
the legs are strong and metal  would have liked that level to been consistent throughout the rest of the designworks as advertised should be sold with a ball head mount but that is not required
does assist in keeping the camera steady in lower lighting situations and makes for a great walking stick also as it dont fit in my camera bag at allthis is not the worlds best walking stick nor is it a tripod nor is it a blunt weapon
however ours lives in the car and has served all three purposes quite well
if were heading on a hike and feel we might need to either have a little extra traction or take some zoom or low light photos or keep some oh hes just growling offleash dog away from our ankles this is a great solution
if it were sturdier it would be heavier
the only reason for  stars is i think it could be a little cheaper  but then again i have no qc issues so maybe its worth iti looked around and after reading the reviews i picked this up and was not disappointedthe fluid head is very smooth for pans and tilts
a surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps lockedthe only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expectfor the price this tripod is tall holds heavy cameras moves smoothly and is stable with over  pounds of camera and lens d    ii on it even for windy night shots on a mountain top
its light enough to carry hiking and its got indoor and outdoor feet built in
its got the bubble level and adjustable friction on the fluid pantilt mechanisms
its stiff enough to be used as a periscope with a lb camera attached grab all three legs together with two hands and hold camera up over a crowdit survives a lot of banging around and the head is solid  but after dropping it from hand height onto the concrete one of the leg extension locks broke
they have some strange tiny pieces of plastic inside seems unnecessarily complicated and flimsy
i replaced it with parts ordered on the phone from velbon
two years later another one broke  i think the airline smashed my luggage that the tripod was inso heres the three issues that make it short of perfectleg extension locks should be redesigned without tiny flimsy plastic parts insideit isnt as light and compact as some tripods areits cheap but not freeso handle with reasonable care buy a spare if youre a pro and enjoyopened the box and was impressed
i have no experience with professional tripods however this tripod is built well if you are careful
people must really smash their equipment around to complain about this tripod being cheap
well built however the fluid head has double adjustment
there are two screws that increase the pressure of the fluid making the tripod drift back during pans
these need to be loosened a bit if the tripod is drifting back too much
the other adjustments lock the tripod in place firm feeling and acceptable
retractable spikes on the feet for outdoors
built in level
fantastic tripod if you are used to cheapo walmart tripodsive used this to shoot video and stills
it does not have a fluid head but it nevertheless pans and tilts very smoothly
there are better tripods out there although for much higher pricesbtw theres a reason they named it videomate
ive used it many times for still photos and in most situations that ive used it  the tripod works fine
but this tripod was not designed for still photography
almost everyone who purchased this would probably realize that this tripod is primarily intended for video
all one has to do is to notice at the name of itthe velbon f is a pretty nice tripod especially for the money
i have been using it for a few months and really like it
the panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nicepros smooth panning quick setup comes with a carrying bag lightweightcons since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitoverall its a great buymy second tripod i purchased this after buying my canon vixia hv and realizing that it didnt have a lanc port so i didnt need an expensive tripod with handle controls
the head on this is amazing allowing for incredible pans
the head is extremely fluid with easy control levers
its heavy enough to be sturdy yet light enough to cary around no problem
it also comes with its own carrying case which is really convenient
the reasons i give it four stars the head plate comes off easy but when putting it back on the lever has come back and jammed into my fingers numerous times
one of the other main reasons i purchased this tripod was that i do a lot of night time photography and this tripod allows for vertical shots
having my heavier camera on there tilted all the way forward to do a vertical shot felt very unstableother than that all around great tripodi have two identical camcorders and needed tripods for both
this is my second velbon videomate  tripod
the first one worked so well that i decided to buy a second one of the same make and model
the fluid head works very smoothly
my pans look very professional
the only reason i did not give it five stars is that it is not as steady when the column is elevated
other than that it is a very good valuethis hard to find product was exactly what i was looking for
amazon really does have everythingthey are good wire ties
a little long and need to be trimmed for most applications or you are wrapping a wire bundle multiple times but better too long than too shortthese are what youd expect from velcro cable ties but i prefer these to the velcro brand version
they have tags that allow the tie to be easily removed and do not attach throughout the cable but only on a small section near the end of the cable
this allows you to more easily wrap a cable and hold it tighter then the velcro brand straps
definitely recommendi purchased these to clean up the maze of cables associated with my computer and auxiliary gear
they work very well
i find that these are superior to the ut wire inch flexi ties cable wrap which i also purchased on amazon
i recommend these selfattaching tiesits all right for the price but like the flexi ties cable wrap better than this
this isnt that neat a purchase
it works and does the job but doesnt keep em together all the timei like the colors and the small tabs but i thought theyd be smaller
add to that fact that theyre only grippy on about an inch at the end and theyre best for larger cables
they definitely wont work for ear buds or small thin cables as theyre far too large for that use which was my primary plan when i purchased them
instead theyll be used to organize power cables under and around my desk
which is not a bad use and the color coding is nice but that wasnt my intent when i purchased themthese are a better way of securing cables than using a wire twister the different colours can be used to identify cables and are reusable
would like to see pacs of various sizesthey are really nice however they are not what i expected
i was wanting the ones with  holders on each side and these only have them on one sidetheres a large market for headphones in the  to  price range and this set is among the bestthe earcups rest comfortably against the side of your head without pressing into your ear at all
i find that i can wear these headphones for hours on end without getting sore ears which would happen with several other similarlypriced headphones i have triedthe level of sound blocking done by these earcups is phenomenal
you can wear them without even plugging them in and enjoy a significant reduction in ambient noise
this also adds to the quality of sound you get when listening to music particularly in noisier environmentsmy only complaint is the volume knob in the cord
the knob sticks out symmetrically from both sides of the plastic housing so its impossible to tell which direction to rotate it to increase or decrease the volume without either trying and listening or looking at the blackonblack markings which are very hard to seethese work great with an ipod i find that leaving the headphone volume knob turned up all the way which essentially means that its passing the signal through without dampening it and the ipod around half volume is a comfortable listening levelthese headphones has very good sound
they fold up well being careful
i like them
but i wish the quailty of the audio was  bit betterupdate the plastic broke while travelling so they no longer stay on my head
consider a product like koss the plug insteadi bought a pair of these about  months ago and use them regularly on airplanes
they are a substantial improvement over the usual cheap headphones provided by the airline because of the noise reduction the around the ear instead of on the ear construction which itself seals against outside noise and the sound qualitythe sound quality is quite acceptable for airplane listening
they dont stand up to good quality headphones that dont have nc and dont fold up but their convenience makes up for itthey dont sound as good as the bose headphones that are sometimes handed out on business class but they are substantially cheapertwo minor downsides
first they can get uncomfortable after a few hours of listening
second there is a little plastic cover for the battery which recently came off and got lost and now the battery sometimes falls out and gets lostoverall they are a substantial improvement over what the airplane gives you
you can actually understand the spoken parts of a movie
they are compact light and easy to carry around so they are always in my carryon bag and i use them a loti wouldnt be surprised if some of the newer units in the same or slightly higher price range would be better as this is an older unitthe sony digital camcorder records excellant video images and sound but most tv set fail to reproduce the image quality and conventional vhs recorders lose the video quality when copying
the still image quality is poor compared to stand alone  mega pixel cameras and cannot be used at the same time you are video tapingworks well with a imac and imovie for editing could not see doing it any other way for less
some sony home pcs also allow for editing using the same firewire interface with the sony camcorderrecommendation  if you want super high qulaity video images and want the small size get this camcorderbut dont get it because it has a still image capability instead get a nice digital still camera for that functiona side note if you use a ir filter on this sony and use the night shot mode you can view and record in infared
cool for experimental video effects and can be done likewise with most digital cameras i am toldive had this camera for  months and i have grown very attached to it
ive beat the crap out of it and it still works fine a good signit fits in ones hand like a crazy opticalrecepting hand gun
after time and experimenting one grows accustomed to its grip and its small size makes the human subjects less nervous almost as if no video camera is there just a miniscule receptor of their realtime imageif you have a friend with one of these too scheeronious you can firewire the  cameras together and do some improvisational editing and recording of footage easilyinfrared nightvison with quotold moviequot  to make night shots mystical overlap fading facemorphing  luminscennt effects
manual exposure adjusting to tweak the lighting in conjuction with slowshutter surrealism
gtgtgt the camera give you a lot of room to playi use the memory stick all the time to capture stills off my prerecorded footage
i like the small x jpegs its easier to work with in photoshop transfers quick saveemstrighttofloppy or emailem size
if one really wants high quality pics one has to capture the live still straight to the stick
raltime capture even makes a simulated digital quotcliclickquot sound of an slr camera when you hit the photo button
sony style at its bestthis camera is great on an airplane to watch all your old movies intransit and catch stills off of them
if you really wanted to you could easily record tv movies etc and watch it on this camera on the plane almost like a minidvd playerproblems  you cant use fader and digital effects at the same time
 you cant activate digital effects with the lcd closed
 the builtin microphone doesnt pick up low bass frequencies real well
 upgrade this camera with a wide angle lens and extended life battery and  meg stick
wide angle is a must it creates a more immersive viewer experiencei have had this camera for about six months now
as a serious ammateur photographer for  years i swore that i would still use my film camera for some things but i havent touched it
i take this sony everywhere
this camera is a great allaround digital camera
it is compact easy to use the menus and controls are easily understood and it takes great pictures
i was thinking about getting the s without the video feature instead but i am very glad i got the video
i really like the video feature and i use it a lot
below are a few major points you should consider about this camerafirst of all no other digital camera brand i have seen comes anywhere close to the lens quality of the sonys
the marco closeup setting allows you to take a picture from literally a half inch away from the subject
most other digital cameras with macro settings let you get as close as a couple feet
this means that when you can get at closest a fullframe picture of your whole hand with other digicams the sony lets you zoom all the way in to just a fingernail
incidentally this camera also has a textcapture mode which i have used quite successfully for taking pictures of blueprints and other documents
these kinds of images show up nicely on the computer screensecondly this camera is fully maccompatible
it comes with a usb cable and software that actually does work on the mac
when you connect the camera to the cable it shows up on the desktop just like a drive
the only problem i have had is when reading files right off the disc  sometimes it thinks theres a problem with the drive
if you first transfer them to your hard drive and then view them theres no problemsome rules of thumb for file size  a high resolution pic x typically takes about k so i figure about one meg each
the medium res x is about k per pic so i figure about three pics per meg
these are still pretty high resolution pictures
the lowest res x pics take about k each a nice size for emailing
thats about  per meg
on video mode the high res x takes about k per second so about  sec of video per meg
the low res video mode x does about  sec per meg
so with the  mb memory stick that comes with the camera you can get about  or  high res pics  med res pics  low res pics  sec high res video or  sec low res video
so in summary get more memory
i bought two  mb cards and they lasted a whole day vacation and i am pretty snaphappythe one problem that i have to complain about is that there is about a onesecond delay between pushing the shutter button and the actual capture of the image
and i am not talking about the  wait time for writing the file i am talking about the actual moment of the photograph  this means that if you are taking pictures of subjects in motion you will have to anticipate the moment and push the button a second early
if you take a lot of action shots this camera will proove frustrating
often a critical moment will have passed by the time the camera actually takes the picture
baby pics wedding dance pictures sports shots all of these are very hard to do with this camera
for regular static subjects this is not a problem but for objects in motion this camera is difficultall in all i highly reccommend this camera
happy shoppingi bought one of these cameras and find it to be all that the others have said
however i find that in the bright sunlight you have trouble seeing  the image in the lcd display
it would be of benefit to have a viewfinder  wish it didi bought one of these about  weeks ago as i write this and have fired a couple hundred pictures and a couple of short videos through it
wonderful
it takes great pictures and the videos with builtin  microphone are pretty cool too
while the controls seemed a little  unwieldy at first once i pulled out the manual i needed less than an hour  to go through the options and see how everything works which isnt too bad  of a learning curve at all
the lcd viewer is great  i can edit and delete  images while shooting thus saving some precious memory stick space
i  have appreciated that the lcd viewscreen can also be swiveled around  laterally and vertically even to point forward so i can take a picture of  myself and at the same time see myself in the viewfinder
brilliant
the  flash does a great job of illuminating scenes
the camera also offers  ability to adjust for white based on indoor outdoor or quototherquot  conditions sounds dumb i know to have quototherquot but trust me  it makes sense
this is my first usb peripheral and i have to say i am  impressed  i can pull down a full mb memory stick pretty darn quick and  its really nice being able to plug the usb port in while the computer is  on and immediately use it without any software hassles
i have to admit  to a certain awe at microsoft for actually pulling it off with win
you  can use the software that comes with the camera but i have not since you  will find better image handling organizing and altering software as  freeware shareware or expensive like photoshop professional  stuffanother super aspect of this camera is the battery  it is  removable but it is rechargable and the camera comes with a dcin jack  and its own external power supply so you can plug the camera into the  wall and recharge that battery for another  hours of use
no more  buying scads and scads of earthkilling aas
this is such a simple builtin  to add and such a highly useful extra i really have to question why every  digitial camera doesnt do thison the downside the viewfinder is very  very difficult to see when outside sometimes impossible to see
and of  course please realize that this camera is a pointandshoot albeit a  functional one so changing lenses is not an option nor is having much  control over fstop or shutter speed  you will have some control but the  fstop and shutter speed ranges are not are not what you might be used to
i also think that overall its senstivity to white is not as good as it  should be  my whites tend to end up a bit grey not much but a bit
but  i have to admit i dont know if thats the camera or a problem with the  really hazy nyc days weve had andor from shooting inside in rooms with a  mix of flourescent and incandescent lightingoverall i am impressed  with this camera im very glad i bought it and not a different one and  while it is not  megapixels unless you plan to make large prints of your  images the resolution on this camera is far higher than you need for  webimage making and high enough for anything else
its small easy to  carry easy to use easy to download and easy to recharge
for the money  this is in my opinion your best deal for a nonprofessional  megapixel  digital camerai have had mine for over a year now and it still works great
it comes with a good long lasting battery the npfmmy only complaint is that the included memory stick is only mb
at high resolution x you would only be able to take about  pictures
i bought a mb stick the very same day and have had great successas the author of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tent and a former radio discjockey i am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the s and s
since i have owned numerous including this one sony products over the years i dont think i am outside my realmi always have a need for music either reviewing archiving or pleasure
the sony cfdzw grants the consumer many features without bloating the price tagwhile it is not going to take the place of the high end system in your music room with its versatility it will be a welcome companion in an office a guest room or in proximity of the kitchen
batteries or electricity the option is yoursthe amfm tuner locks in the stations well without the drifts often associated with lesser models
there are settings to taylor the sound to your liking rock pop vocalsthe dual tape enables recording from tape to tape cd to tape or radio to tape
the cd portion of the unit is reliable when handled properlyif you dont want to spend endless time researching a good unit sony is a name you can trustenjoy the music and be wellcraig fentonauthor of the jefferson airplane book take me to a circus tenti still rate it  stars because of the quality of the sound the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price
sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes so that means its great rightfor its size it has good sound
i connected it to some external speakers instead of the ones it came with and it works fine
the included remote is a bonus although it doesnt seem to control the cassette playeri have had this unit for quite a while i think i got it when it was on sale
i still use it in the bedroom listening to cds putting me to sleep at nightgreat deal
the controller is another story if you make a controller with all the same size buttons with no distiguishable pattern make it illuminate so you can see it at night
i have memorized many controllers by use but this one i still have to turn on a light to find the right buttonvalentines day is my one chance per year to make up for all the stupid lazy thoughtless horny arrogant and unromantic things my wife has put up with since the last vday
my only hope to get out of the doghouse and back in the bunkhouse is to pull off a grand romantic gesture that makes her forget the neanderthal she lives with for  days in betweenalso i dont want to spend too much money
some of that stupid lazy thoughtless stuff can get pretty expensive
so its a real challengewhats more romantic than the image of john cusack with his boombox in say anything playing sweet peter gabriel nothings to his sweetie
this sturdy durable throwback casetteandcd combo player was perfect for me to recreate the scene
i downloaded a copy of in your eyes on mp burned it to cd dubbed it over to a blank tape and i was all setof course my wife and i live in the same house so i couldnt very well serenade her from the street
plus its cold outside and the neighbors already give me funny looks
so i decided to stand outside our bathroom door after her shower one morning
me romantic her naked  perfectunfortunately holding this oversized bulky monster over my head for fourplus minutes wasnt the best idea ive had
and all that rererecording of the song made it come out all muffled and tinny through the detachable speakers
one of which detached during the chorus and bonked me in the head
by the time the song was over i was collapsed under the boombox in a heap on the floor and my wife  wrapped demurely in a towel  cracked the bathroom door to askdid you just say something
i had the blow dryer on
so im still in the doghouse and may have suffered the first lloyd doblerrelated hernia on medical record
outstandingthis is a great case for thecanon powershot a mp digital camera with x optical zoom gray
good padding and protection
camera fits snug and the small pocket will hold four rechargeable aa batteries
the camera only needs two at a time so you have good backup powerthis is a bag for professionals
people this can easily fit  lenses a slr body battery charger  cords a few filterseven the manual and still have room for more  and the padding aint that bad eitherthe buildquality is excellent and overall i would definitely recommend it if u really intend to carry a lot of stuff or else go for something smalleroveralla great productusing it to hold a panasonic  plasma tv
it is very low profile looks great and is rock solid even with a large flat panel doesnt tip at all
well worth the moneydecent amount of options good lens quality but do wish it had exposure compensation and spot metering ive found many lighting situations where this camera could have used those features
also wish the lens were a little wider angle so found a used canon zwwe bought this camera after consumer reports gave it a best buy rating and because wed had an older canon sureshot which had recently died after  years of very good servicei was initially disturbed to find that the camera requires dxcoded film
i usually order my film from a mail order supplier and they do not carry dx film which from what ive been able to discover means that there is more information bar coded onto the canister
this i could live without
however the manual tells you that its possible to use regular film though it may be a little more difficult to load and furthermore it will always register as iso  not  or  or 
i was pretty unhappy about all thiswe bought some dx film and had it developed taking pictures in many different circumstances  indoorsoutdoors withwithout flash articialnatural light etc
the results were very good in all conditionsnext we loaded regular kodak film iso 
i could not get the film to load
i placed the reel in with various lengths of film exposed but that didnt help
i tried to depress the shutter button as recommended in the manual but that did not help
my husband got the film to load on the first try
i believe this is because i had warmed it up for him
again we took pictures in many circumstances and the quality surprisingly was finethe features offered work well
the manual is good
also the battery is much more reasonable than previous batteries which cost about price
i would say the only problem withe this camera as with its predecessor is a sluggish zoom mechanisma very good camera at a good pricei bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter age  about  months ago
she is actually a knowledgeable photographer having taken photography courses in school but wanted a simple pointandshoot that she could use without having to think about fstops and shutter speeds
as i am also a photography fan since my misspent youth its common ground for us and i get to see all of her picturesi have to say that the camera has far exceeded both our expectations
it does a very respectable job under a variety of conditions and produces sharp wellfocused consistent photos
it is simple to use and the zoom lens is terrific
we have not seen the flash problems that some of the other reviewers have reported
the only difficulty she has had with it is the pause between pressing the shutter button and the camera actually shooting but that is overcome by using realtime mode whenever redeye reduction is not an issuebut i think perhaps the best feature of this camera is its portability
it is so small and light and the lens retracts into the body and covers up when the power is turned off that she is able to keep it in her pocketbook at all times
whenever life presents her with one of those gee i wish i had a camera moments she doesif youre looking for something inexpensive and durable enough so that you can keep it with you and that you can use without too much thinking this is a good bet
update  just  weeks before the year warranty would have expired the camera developed a serious problem with its autofocus
we called the canon  number and were referred to a local authorized repair center to whom we brought it
they called after a week and told us that they would have to send it to canon and that there would be a  service charge
that was about a week agoeven though the situation is not yet resolved i thought it was important to post this update since ive seen exactly this same problem reported in several of the other reviews here
the camera was not heavily used nor was it abused in the year that my daughter owned it
i am reducing my rating to stars because of this
i will update again when we get the camera back from canonthe most important thing you need to keep in mind is that because the coolpix has a built in lens unlike slr any modification telewide add on will invariably degrade the quality of the picture in both sharpness and exposure
that said the nikon fisheye is excellent in both sharpness and quality compared to my tiffen wide angle lens
there is obvious distortion at the picture edges and you will have to compensate for exposure by increasing ev about 
also it blocks the internal flash so you will need an external flash if flash is requireda truly fun piece of glass and i use it as both a toy and a tool
i love to shoot people and objects with it and see what the distortion does to the image but its also incredibly useful when you have no room to work or back up
i found it especially useful in the confined spaces of aircraft cockpits
but that fine thread to mount it on the camera drives me nuts
especially when im in the confined space of something like an aircraft cockpit
but i always put it in my kit when on the roadwe decided to purchase this after reading some of the reviews of the memorex mp cd player
i got exactly what i expecteda portable cd player that plays my mp tunes
the esp is fairly good
considering that an mp song takes up only  the space compared to a regular cd if the lens moves in the slightest bit the song is over
i havent tested the player with it sitting on my dash yet thoughit doesnt recognize id tags but it does have a pretty neat organization of the tunes
each folder on the cd is an quotalbumquot and then the songs in the folder are tracks on that album
it plays the albums alphabetically by the  short dos name and likewise for each track
so heres a tip if you want to order them how you like
as dos naming is curious add the track number to the beginning of each mp filename then the expanium will definitely play the tunes in the necessary order
i learned this after my first cd mixsince the display simply shows only the album number and track i recommend using a utility like mplister to generate a list of all the tracks
i sort the list in excel by folder then by filenameits a very simple design and it plays all my mp songs so i have been very pleased
i cant stop making cds nowok mine just showed up in the mail so some thoughts  lets start with the sound
it sounds great but the earphones do suck and the volume is too low
i knew the earphones would suck though so i replaced them with some sennheiser s which sound fabulous
on the volume thing i think it may have to do with safety  youre not supposed to blast headphones and this unit will not let you
the thing does not skip
it does not play all mps perfectly
now i get all my mps at  bps over napster but not for long
whether this has to do with the quality of mps im getting or not i dont know
i create my discs with easy cd creator which the unit seems to handle just fine
the display is fine
s far as not displaying the name of the song what cd player does this
i think were getting a little spoiled here
the display does not look cheap
when these things actually get down to what they should cost   about  bucks  this thing will rock
until then its an expensive toythis is a great mpcd player
in term of sound quality it is good
when i listen to my mps i notice that piano and guitar harmonics sounds are kind of distorted
even though i cant tell if it is mps encoding problem or the units decoding problem i will say it is mps encoding problem because of the way encoders work
just remember one thing mp player consist of at least  important pieces mp decoder which transform mp bytestream into waveform and the da convertor which transform waveform into analog signal that we can hear
the mp decoder is pretty much standard but the da convertor is not
thats where you should look at in term of playback quality and it is also why i wont buy a shadybrand alternative
unit does not support id tags but it is not a problem to me since i just put inside a drawer in my car
one bad thing in my set up is that i cant do song searching etc
while driving but perhaps a remote like a standard cdplayer one would help which is lacking here
i think the mp organization on cd can be done with this way and thats what i do  write a readmetxt in each dir that tells you what the heck is in the dir
name your subdir and songs like album mp etc
and it should be finethis little machine is great
there are of course a few small features that id prefer like a more detailed display but that really doesnt matter
i yank a cd full of mps and pop it in my car cassette player using the adapter
push the random button and im good to go for about two weeks of commutes to and from workthe thing is obviously pretty durable since its been sitting in my car since i bought it over  months ago  it has been frozen in the winter and sat for hours in the blazing sun  still works like a charmglitches have been very rare  maybe one skip in every  tracks played
money well spenti jog alot so i previously purchased the tdk mojo since it claimed to have an  minute buffer thinking that its antiskip feature would be perfect
well it wasent
after approximately  minutes it would just skip or even stop completely
a friend of mine recently purchased an avc soul mp player for jogging and that one also skipped
i began to wonder if there was actually a cdmp player that didnt skip
i then skeptically purchased the philips expanium
i took it jogging and to my suprise this unit did not skip at all
i used a mp discnot sure how it does on cds
now i know this player lacks a couple of features such as id tags and a backlit screenbig dealso what
the only real drawback was that the volumes level was not high enough for me but i tend to like my music on the loud side anyway
i just ended up buying a boosteroo to take care of the volume issue
the sound is exellent and thats important
i am very pleased with this unitok here is the good stuffthe philips expanium has a tough rugged case
it plays regular audio cds as well as homemade cdrs and cdrws which is a real plus
the biggest plus is that it also plays cds that have been recorded with mp files
it can play up to  mp files if you can squeeze that many small ones onto a cd
more likely you will have about  songs
compare that to the  or  songs you get on a standard audio cdthe sound quality is as you would expect great
it has antiknock protection
it can play the songs in sequence or shuffle them
it has all the standard features found on most portable cd players
and it has a separate audio out jack in addition to the headphone jacknow for the bad stuffthe silver control buttons look pretty sharp but theyre hard to identify
the lcd display is tiny and not very bright
if you record more than one quotalbumquot thats the name philips uses to designate a separate file folder the cd will play all the songs in all the folders shuffled or not
you can quotprogramquot it to play only certain songs but thats kind of tedious
it would also be nice if the display showed the file name or song title instead of just the sequence number of the file
and although it does come with a car adapter i found the volume is not high enough
you have to turn your car stereo volume up to the point where it begins to humoverall its a good buy and in my opinion it represents the future of music playersi use mine in my car where the great accessories to power it and adapt it to a tape deck work flawlessly
a good cdmp player is one that you dont notice at all and for the most part it fits the bill
the sound is great and ive never had a single skip
the position memory takes off at the song i leave off at when i last park the car which is really nicemy peeve with it is the fact that it takes so long to start up
it does a full scan of the cd even if its the same cd that was previously in there
this usually takes between  and  seconds which is a big distraction if youre making short trips
it should store the cd id and song contents in its buffer and only rescan if it needs to
it would also be nice if it had a song title display but thats not a big issue for mei bought this player when it first came out and it is an incredibly solid and reliable unit
the only major flaw is that it does not fast forward search or rewind reverse search through individual mp files it searches fine on cd audio files
it also searches fine through foldersdirectories both cd audio and mps
the lcd isnt that great but thats not important to me
it doesnt read id tags but i dont care about that eitherif id tags and ffrew doesnt matter to you id say buy this one
it will play anything you throw at it
anything
 bitrate hz cdr cdrw iso joliet
i was thrilled with the player but i really need a ffrew feature because i listen to many mp books
some of the chapters are  mins long
if i have to stop in the middle of a chapter i end up having to listen to the first half all over again
bummer
so i bought a riovolt to solve that problemanyway my expandium is still alive and well and used for mp songs not books
i highly recommend this product except for that one mp seach flaw
i hope philips gets the hint and will fix this in their next revthe case is well made and sturdy
the hold button works fine
the sound is good if you dont use the included earbuds
the separate line out works great
ive never heard it skip a beat
ever
and im not exactly dainty with electronic gear
the resume feature resumes to the begining of the last track played
note this is another less important flaw to meit doesnt resume to the exact spot where you powered off but at least it goes back to the folder and file you were last listening to
many players dont resume at all
supposedly the riovolt resumes to the exact spot with a firmware upgradehavent tried it yetbottom line buy it if you dont need to search thru individual mps and if you dont need id tagsthis player does what its advertized to do
it plays cds and it plays mps on both cdr and cdrw media
sound quality is excellent even with mps
much better than the dismal sound quality of the similar but less expensive mptrip player that i wish i hadnt purchased and now sits on a shelf gathering dust
that said heres what could be improved  include a carrying case or at least offer one
i searched the entire amazon site and couldnt find a case for the player
only generic cases that were too bulky to be useful since they accommodated a number of cd jewel cases in addition to the player
if you use mp cds the one in the player and one on the side would do
one mp cdr encoded at kbs holds  average length song titles
 enlarge the display and show me the mp track title not just an arbitrary number
the data is on the mp cd let me see it
 ship the player with rechargeable nimh batteries and allow them to charge while the player is plugged into ac power with the included ac adapter
i know you can buy nimh batteries and chargers as a separate item from multiple sources and i did
but it would be nice not to have to physically remove and replace the batteries everytime they are discharged
battery compartment lids on these products arent the most durable part of the devicegreat value in a preamp if you dont need a phono input
adding a phono input to this preamp will require an aftermarket stand alone unit and they are not cheap
you can build your own if youre an accomplished diyer but either way be advised that this unit has no phono preamp
otherwise it has great sound and just the right amount of input and switches that youre likely to use in the typical home stereo setup
you may not like that the volume control uses detentes i find that annoying so thats why this is  stars
i use this with its sister power amp the amp   clean raw  d excellent sound stage and separation
low undetectable noise and distortion
transparent
this preamp has driven magnepans with an atlantic audio sub and it simply disappears
no hum no feed back no ground loop issuesi bought this wo checking to see if i had an preamp jacki assumed i did
clearly by now you know i did not so i goofed
however if you want to power an outdoor system or secondary system at home this will do the trick
let me caution you though make sure you read the specs
i made another boo boo by reading too quickly i thought it was  watts per channeluh no  watts total ie
 per channel
i kinda blew it on this one and can only blame myself
if you dont need much power and only want to power smaller speakers grab this now
if you have larger speakers go for the next model up with a bit more power
all in all for the price it does the trickthe stereo preamp once a standard item in any serious hifi setup has become difficult to find of late
this is the only one i know of thats still in production and thats intended for home use
it already seems a little dated with its dedicated input for lazerdiscs remember those
but
its a good basic unit although youll need a separate phono cartridge amp for your vinyl collection
also the stated power rating of the switched outlet is too low to handle a large power ampi purchased these to go with ceiling speakers for a coffee shop
they were a good combination and worked well togetherfirst there  is nothing wrong with this amp
however with todays speaker design it is a bit much for the discreet seven channel home theater system unless you are trying to outfit it for a gymnasium sized room
i bought three of these because the price was right and they work fine  but at the settings im using at one quarter power its like putting a hemi  v in a volkswagen beetle
the  watt version   watts per channel would have done fine
i also purchased the  watt version for the center channel speaker and it is more than adequatei have two of these
i bought the first amp one the older model with  sets of inputs and  sets of speaker outputs and the meters on the face to use with a computer it was actually a little annoying functionally to use for that
i tried it on my home theater to drive my front speakers i didnt notice a bit difference with my bose s the older triangle footprint ones
those are ohm speakers and i never had a problem with it shutting down or overheating btw
i kept it there because it looked nice on my stack of equipment  and eventually picked up a second amp one like the one pictured just to try out in other applicationsanyway after some time i replaced my bose which i never thought were super speakers by any means with some paradigm mini monitors
with those speakers i could hear a difference between my receiver yamaha rxv and the amp one
not just in loudness but in clarity
things just sound more alive
i run the nd amp in bridged mode to power  paradigm titans wired in serial as my center channelim sure that these are not the endallbeall of amps but theyre better than my receivers amps which was itself noticeably better than previous amps that id had
im considering getting another amp one or two for the rear or getting a step up in brand to a rotel maybe and comparing
ive gotten a couple really great deals on amp ones
i dont think id pay  for one and  is pushing it but if you can grab one up for less than  its a sweet dealthese work great in bridged mono mode
i ran three across the front of my home theaters in mono mode one for each of my three front speakers
they did great
however you do have to manually power each one up and down with the button on the front
not a huge deal but it adds to the steps one must take
i took them out of my theater only bc my receiver does a good job by itself and i did not have room for any more plugs in a new old house we boughtive been using this trackball for about  years
its a great product
i tend to ruin the chords after  years and have to purchase a replacement
my only complaint about this trackball and this is extremely irritating for me is that logitech has not changed the wireless receiver that attaches to the computer
everyone is using tiny little usb receivers as is logitech for most of their wireless products
yet this trackball has this stupid receiver thats about the size of a cookie attached to a ft chord
i love this trackball but if a competitor comes out with a similar thumb driven trackball with a small receiver ill switch in a heartbeata classic ergonomic design
these devices have been very popular for years
but this product is long overdue for an update
logitechs customer forums have dozens of requests for new versions of the thumb trackball devices but logitech hasnt even bothered to reply in years one customer got an email reply acknowleding that they got lots of requests for new trackman modelsthis model uses antiquated  mhz wireless technology
the range is very limited and the receiver is a large corded blob half as big as the trackman itselfit doesnt have many of the buttons and features that most of the newer logitech mice haveplease logitech listen to your loyal customers and come out with some new trackballbased devicesusing any computer that has a gui with carpel tunnel is a miserable experience
ive spent  years trying to find an input device and have a large collection if usb and bluetooth mice
i decided to change my point of view in my search and started to look at trackballsthe great thing with this model is that i can leave my extra large hand in one place on the unit the ball fits idealy under my thumb fingers hit on the buttons and wrist can stay in a straight comfortable allignmentmy only complaint is that the cordless range gets really short when the battery starts to die which has been every  weeks
the signal wont pass through any books on my desk
also the base has a long cord which makes portable laptop use a pain
i have ordered two of the older corded models which should resolve those problemsi was a little afraid of logitech after owning their first and second generation mice which i found lacking in ergonomics and also in longevity but after a year now this is in the almost as great as presliced bread categoryif you like to use trackballs with your thumb this is the onei have had this trackball for over one year now
ive used the wiredusb version for my work laptop so i wanted the wireless for my home laptop
the ergonomics are great
like many others this mouse fits your palm like a glove
originally when i first started using trackballs it took some getting used to but once you get the feel for it youll be a trackball more appropriately a thumbball prothe buttons are welllocated convenient and comfortable
you really dont feel like you need to hyperextend or move any of your digits to perform functions
the only digit of your hand that is active is your thumbat its best i have found the range on the trackball to be excellent
i have a desktop docking station for my laptop
i have the rf station hooked up to my dock
i can sit on my couch on the other side of my home office    ft away with my laptop undocked and the trackball responsive at my side
great responsiveness for a reasonable rangenow the quirks keep in mind i have had this for over one year sometimes the mouse becomes unresponsive and sluggish the mouse pointer slows down clicking may not work and sometimes entire sections of a page may highlight simply by moving the pointer over a page
if the mouse is acting up ive also found that shaking it around kind of helps  that is my first line of triage for the mouse
if that doesnt work ive found myself replacing the battery maybe  times over the past year resetting the rf signal you simultaneously push these little buttons on both the rf station and on the actual mouseanother quirkmaintenance mouselint builds up inside the trackball on the little nubs that hold the ball up
also its good to clean the optical sensor window now and then as that can accumulate dirt and oil as wellsince i have both the wired and wireless versions of this trackball i can say that the wireless one is not as crisp and responsive as the usbwired one but it is not noticeable when the wireless is working at its peak conditionthis is a great trackball for ergolovers
the quirks are tolerable
id love to see a bluetooth version and see what the performance difference would besimple and stable design
wide palm rest very natural and comfortable feel
wish there were back and forward buttons
many options for configuring pointer movement and actionsbattery cover difficult to open was concerned about breaking itmake sure to position the receiver with ample open space around it not next to other devices or mouse movements may be erraticthe logitech cordless trackman wheel isnt a new product
it was designed sometime between  and  but the box has been refreshed with stickers that show it is certified for use with windows vista
it even includes a ps adapter which has become all but obsolete in  that said i needed a cordless trackball for use with my media center pc so i could watch movies and tv shows without having to grab a mouse pad for my cordless mouse
the pad becomes a pain because it is difficult to use a mouse on my couch
the trackball made a lot more sense
i did however test this trackman on my desktop to see how it works in normal usagefirst the maximum effective range was tested to be  feet with direct line of sight and no other objects in the way
in the living room this range was slightly shorter for unknown reasons other than the fact there might have been interference from my microsoft cordless keyboard and mouse receiver
even with the shorter range i had a good  feet of rangethe trackman module uses only  aa battery
i have been using a high capacity nimh rechargeable which should last  months before it selfdischarges
i also found that no drivers are needed unless you want to customize the button functions
i just plugged in the receiver in xp and vista and was using the trackball with easethe trackball has been around for years but apparently it has not caught on
its definitely not as intuitive as a mouse but has its merits in limited spaces or if you dont have a table top surface
its supposedly great for those suffering from repetitive motion disorders or carpal tunnel syndrome
i intended to use this for my media center pc and not for office applications but it did take some getting used to especially in photo apps and even web browsingtheres no back button or additional buttons besides the left and right buttons and the scroll wheel button
theres no tilt wheel function but this trackman was also designed nearly a decade ago when such features werent as prevalent
another drawback is that it is designed for right handed users only
southpaws will have to look elsewherethe trackman and receiver are large in dimensions
theyre not as sleek and sexy as the bluetooth mice or cordless mice with micro transceivers but it gets the job done
i cant seem to find many modern cordless trackball designs due to the low popularity of this type of devicepros great for limited spaces optical technology doesnt require frequent cleaning smooth ball rolling action all of the buttons are very tactilecons rh users only not as intuitive as mouse no tilt wheel buttons no backforward buttons large unit and the receiver is very large
the range is acceptableoverall  starsthis is a really great trackball
i have used the original ps version then got a usb and now went wireless for work
works quite wellhowever i think its time for logitech to create a similar one to use laser for better precision
at times it feels like the movement is not  accurate as if there is a slight lag in movement
not really noticeable though unless you have used a laser mouse before very smooth movementthis is definitely a lot more comfortable than most trackballs i have usedive used this mouse for the past few years at work
id had some handwristarm discomfort from frequent mousing and purchased this  as well as thefellowes  antimicrobial split design keyboard black which btw is wonderfulwhile almost frustrating to learn at first  until you get the thumb motion down the cursor can be devilishly difficult to control  within  weeks i was not only mousing with ease but had completely eliminated all armhand paini recently set up my home office more ergonomically also and decided to purchase the corded version of this mouse logitech trackman wheel optical silver
not only is it a better color the darker silver better hides smudges and wear but it doesnt use wasteful batteries approx  aa battery every  mos
and i dont have to worry about finding an outofthewaybutstilleffective place for the receiver
since both the corded and the cordless take up a usb port and since both mice remain stationary you move the cursor with the thumbball not the whole mouse and since the cordless receiver is on a long wire anyway i dont see any point in spending the extra money  the initial higher price plus the costhassle of batteries  to purchase this cordless versionhad i known these things back when i first bought this mouse id have chosen the corded version
but both are excellent mice that can help you say goodbye to armwrist pain foreveri got this mouse primarily because i was getting tendonitis in my mouse hand
by the end of the day i had to spend  minute flexing and massaging my hand for every  minutes of mouse work
this has resolved that problem
i dont get any of the stiffness and soreness i get from a regular mouse
however i have had to sacrifice precision
when you need to be precise and quick with the mouse pointer this mouse can be somewhat clumsy to work with
for this reason i have to keep my regular mouse hooked up as well but its a small concession to make for the overall benefit of this mouse
also ive noticed that the ball is starting to stick so its essential that you keep it very clean
i imagine alcohol wipes will work fine for thisi have this trackman as well as the new wireless optical trackmani found this one easier to use with the ball controlled by the thumb and the rest of the fingers are nicely placed on the primary buttonsthe optical trackman on the other hand uses your fingers to move the ball and your thumb to press the buttonsi think the best combi would be the wireless trackman with a few more buttons 
so i guess we will have to let logitech take it to the drawing board to come out with a  star trackmanjeremygot this mouse for my husbands new computer because he had a similar one that finally died
this isnt the one i use but its easy enough and he loves itone thing that can be said for logitech
they give you a great warranty five years on these products i think and if anything goes wrong they honor it immediately
they are great to deal withgood
nice trackball with good wireless range
far far better than a kensington one which i used before this
accurate and easy to use
highly recommended
btw i use this with a htpc connected to a lcd tv so that there arent cables aplenty running across the living room
it serves this purpose very well together with a wireless keyboard of coursethis cordless mouse simply feels great in my hand
ive owned about  different mouses and this one pleases me because it feels like part of my hand rather than part of the pc
i find that my thumb moves the trackball effortlessly while my index finger shifts almost without thought between the wheel and buttons
i seem to get consistent communication between the mouse and the receiver as ive not noticed any performance problems
batteries last about a year and the mouse tells you when they are getting low by posting an alertalso i share this mouse with my two children
its been dropped on a hardwood floor more than i probably know about
and it still worksexcellent design and reliable service
i hope this review helpsi do a lot of work on my computer
i do graphic design as well as network administration and various other things
i have had issues with carpal tunnel type issues on standard mice
this mouse is the best thing i have ever found
i have used mine for  years
it is comfortable easy smooth and accurate
once you are used to not moving your hand it is a breeze and is crucially useful in dual monitor set ups trying moving your hand on a standard mouse across two screens without picking it uplast year i got a macbook pro and have been using a mighty mouse and although for a mouse it is good it is painfully obvious that i miss my trackman when using it
it is so apparent that i just bought a cordless version for that laptop specifically
it is a large body mouse as some have noted which can be annoying physically but it is so good at what it does i dont notice
it is great ergonomically and i have not had one pain since using itthis is the wireless version of the legendary logitech track wheel we love but i should have paid more attention to the comments in the reviews about the limited rangeif i have the receiver even  feet away the response suffers
i have placed the receiver right under my monitor about a foot away
i guess it is better than the wired trackman where i was always hassling with the cord getting in the waywhen you have the pair close enough it works as well as a wired trackman wheel and that is the pretty much perfect pointing device deserving of its reputation and cult statussetting it up was harder than youd think
you cant get the user manual  even from logitech  but i guessed that once you put a aa battery in the trackball you use a pin or pen to push the recessed button on the underside of the trackball and press the connect button on the receiver
it took several tries for me to get it working on my mac
it only worked when the receiver was plugged in directly to the usb port and not through a usb hubbottom line  the logitech cordless trackman wheel works as well as the wired trackman wheel but you youre only eliminating the first foot or so of cordid likely get another one of these in the future
i have the bluetooth m and didnt like the response of that
sighonly gave it  stars cause would prefer a tiny receiver like some hitech gadgets are outfitted with but as far as the mouse itself its the kingi recently purchased two of the logitech cordless trackman wheel trackballs
i neededwanted one for my desktop windows pc and one for my desktop mac
i first hooked it up and installed it on the windows pc and immediately loved it
its ergonomic design makes it very comfortable only for right handers and the tracking is very responsive
i looked forward to installing it on my maci researched customer reviews logitechs web site pc worlds web site and mac world
i could not find any support or even troubleshooting ideas for getting this product to work with my mac
i was disappointed because i really do like the trackball
additionally the packaging claims that it is mac compatible but if thats true theres no help or mac related instructions
even the cd rom that comes with the trackball does not have any mac executables on it
so i sent it the second one back
after doing some more research i bought for my mac the kensington expert mouse trackball model number 
guess what
it is way better than the logitech
it is more expensive and it is not wireless but in addition to being extrmely comfortable and responsive it comes with a detachable wrist rest
ive priced comparable wrists rests and a comparable one is   the logitech is not suitable for laptops because a wired usb receiver needs to be plugged into your computer for the trackball to work
this would be very cumbersome in a laptop environmentso while the logitech is a very good product it is not in my humble opinion the best or most comfortable trackball out there
that and the mac non compatibility issue are the only reasons i gave this product  stars instead of  while some may argue that the price difference makes the logitech a better value i disagree
these are items that i use  to  hours six days a week and having a comfortable solution that will prevent stress andor carpal tunnelwell an extra  or  for that is prevention im happy to paybuy this product for your windows pc with confidence
if you buy the logitech for additional comfort also buy the  fellowes gel flex transparent mini wrist rest blue crystal for  at amazonor if you dont need a wireless solution buy the kensington which has a very comfortable padded wrist rest includedhappy computingi really liked this mouse but thought it would last longer than it did
loved all the different uses it has on iti was having wrist and elbow pain in my right arm due to working on a computer all the time and using my mouse quite frequently
a friend of mine suggested a track ball and i decided to buy this one and have been very happy
my wrist and elbow pain have all but gone away
the only reason i didnt give it a  stars is because sometimes the ball sticks
it usually becomes unstuck very easily but it is a little annoyingthis is a solid buy
if you just want to point and shoot it does it without a problem
however if you want to be creative with your photography this is where this unit really shines
you can turn off the autofocus for shots that you want to blend foreground and background
the macro feature brings the lens to within about two inches of your subject
the x zoom keeps the focus sharp on your distant subjects
the memory sticks are great a  mb stick held about  of my picturesi only have two criticisms
the auto focus may take too long for action shots
and the memory stick floppy adapteryou need one of these a regular floppy will only hold  pictures in high resolution modetakes about twenty seconds to record the shot
a long time if you have wiggling kids and want to take multiple shotsi still would recommend that you get one of these
itll make you look like a pro photoghowdi  i got it couple of months ago and i must admit that its great in terms of image resolution and quality
the like taking this camera to any concerts or shows and you have all the images on floppyshare it with people or publish on the netjust great
and on top it supports image stabilization just like my other sony trv and i can exchange batteries between themthe only thing which i dont like that much are the big size of thisdue to  inch floppy and mpeg movie which is not very good in quality if you are moving the camera very fast and i dont even make many mpegs out of this
otherwise its so much fun using this and since im into photography it lets me publish some photos online quicklypros great features include x optical zoom incredible
 viewfinder lcd photo size adj mic and mpg recordign ability for quick little videoscons bulky battery power can go fast if using a lots of featuresoverall id get this mavica again
good stuff from sonywith x zoom and rechargable lithiumion battery how could you possibly go wrong
if you are using the camera in bad light or have to focus quickly this camera does in both quickly and magnificently
great for home movies of your wife and her lover getting it on behind the chinese buffet dumpster
with the x zoom you can really get close to the grease smears and nail marks on that dirty dirty dirty jezebel
anyways enough of my personal life
this is a good camera
easy to use easy to figure out
sony bravo
keep up the good work
much love to the pacific rim
keep it digitally real
wordwith this piece combined with a x barlow i can get great magnification without using highpower eyepieces
only problem i found is the thread does not fit with the celestron filters
i clarify i can couple the filters with my celestron  eyepieces but i cannot screw it directly in the meade barlow
i can do it with the celstron barlow
not a big deal because anyway i use the celestron barlow along with the meade barlow
i wonder why the manufactures does not establish a standard for the threadsi bought the lens to match my meade telescope so am not able to compare it to other brands
i thought it was a quality lens for a reasonable pricethis barlow gives close up views of planetary and deep space objects at a reasonable price
quality appears to be good and the barlow may enable my son and i to dable in astrophotographyi love my etx but putting it on an object manually can be a literal pain in the neck
thats because the straight through viewfinder which great for terrestial viewing is not so good when youre trying to look up at the stars
i assume this is why it is standard on th etx since that is more of an astronomy scopethe good news is this viewfinder makes finding things easier because youre look angle is the same for the view finder and the eyepiece
the bad news is that youre most comfortable view is to tilt it off to the side away from the eyepiece and that makes quotdrivingquot the scope nonintuitive
i also found it harder to align than the straight through finderon the bright side this leaves you with the original viewfinder as a nice spotting scope for your younger astronomersthis finder a standard on the etx is a must for the etx if one plans on using it for astronomy
the straight thru finder is fine for birding or other terrestrial viewing but is akwardly placed for most astronomical observing especially near the zenith overhead
the tiny screw used to hold the finder can be difficult to replace
then again it is still only a mm finderjust a little research into how this works shows that this is a twopiece system
first something to attach to your particular model of telescope and then something to attach that piece to your particular brand of camera
such low ratings based upon not understanding this are unjustifiedupdate  ive used this along with the appropriate adapter with my canon d and a meade atx telescope
while its difficult to focus sensitive controls it produced excellent pictures
for the amount of money the adapter costs it opens up a lot of possibilities for photographyi have just converted fron a psion to the palm about two months ago and  i love it
the main complaint of most people build quality is right palm could have easily done better
other than that here are my pros amp cons
 its compact amp inexpensive so you do not have to think twice before slipping it into your pants or shirt pocket
i previously owned a palm pilot personal and the difference in size and weight is noticable  carrying the personl or the revo was annoying after an hour or two i now carry the m all day and hardly notice it
 hotsync if you use outlook caledar do not even consider a psion
their synchronization software is stone age compared to hotsync amp pocketmirror all included in the box
 batteries a matter of personal taste i guess but i like using a couple of aaas for a month and than just buy new ones which can be found everywhere better than worrying about taking a charger with me when i travel
  degrees hinge flip cover  the most functional cover i have seen so far its thin sturdy and can flip open using one hand
 my favorite add ons  minicalc  a commercial spredsheet app
that syncs nicely with exell
 thinkdb  a commercial database app with customizable forms amp filtering
 mias email sync spelling checker display pixel count
voice recording
 ram size mb becomes marginal with the add on apps mentioned above

i cant imagine life without it
using a stylus you can easily enter appointments phone numbers todo lists etc
by writing in the small screen
the handwriting recognition is less than perfect but it has come a long way since pdas were first introduced
most letters of the alphabet are straightforward to write but a few such as k q and t require specialized although easily remembered strokes
numbers are intuitive but punctuation requires a little more studyyou wont find tons of features on this model but i find that i rarely use everything it does offer
its simple gray and black screen is easy to read in both bright and dim conditions
have an appointment next year
a standing one every tuesday
no problem
navigating the calendar from daily to monthly to yearly displays is a breeze
i frequently use the alarm feature to remind me of obligations im likely to forget  it can be set to go off a minute or several hours beforehand
with a push of a button you can go to your address book todo list appointment calendar and a palm stroke tutorial
icons on the screen itself take you to the overall menu calculator and search featuresyou can synch the information entered on the palm to your pc so youll have two updated copies of all your information
the mac requires a little more finagling than does a pc but is compatible
i highly recommend this for people who have not yet tried a pda
you wont be overwhelmed with bells and whistles and yet youll have more than enough features to suit your needs
its reasonable price also makes it attractive for students and people hesitant to carry expensive items around with themi had never seen the need for such a device until i was given one
now i cant get along without it
i love my m
it synchs with my outlook software so i can carry about my contacts as well as my to do notes and much more
it has games to keep me occupied  on the bus and trains and planes
it has the ability to beam cards notes and even applications between units
amazing little helper
i definitely recommend iti received the palm m for christmas of  and it proved very useful until the fall of  when it suddenly began to have the same problem reported by other reviewers it began draining batteries very quickly and could not hold information while changing batteries i would have to reload all my backed up data every time i changed batteries
i am usually on the road so this created a problem unless i replaced my desktop with a laptopto make a long story short i trashed the old palm and bought a used one to replace it for fifteen dollars and when i replaced my pc with anapple imac g desktop with  mlla  ghz powerpc g  mb ram  gb hard drive dvdcdrw drive the palm made the transition well after i added akeyspan high speed usb serial adapter   usahs would i buy another
it depends on price it has an inherent flaw but i found a replacement quickly and for a good price
it serves my needs i can concentrate on my work because dont have to learn to use another device and it works well
moreover my first palm worked well for nearly five years which is pretty good for an electronic device that got carted all over the country multiple timeslast because the palm is outdated there are many accessories that can now be purchased for pennies on the dollar such as thepalmone m series slim leather carrying case and colorul faceplates like thepalmone m series faceplate cover pacific blueafter using the m for about a week i can say im still very happy with it and i do tend to be very picky when it comes to gadgets being an industrial designer bu profession
the looks are definitely cool much nicer than than palm iii and light years ahead oh the handspring the unit is also infinitely cute
actually i have to admit i chose this device over visor mostly based on the looks  it is very comfortable to hold and use also to carry around being very light
despite the weight and all plastic construction the unit does feels solid
my biggest remark on the build quality is the flip cover connection to the body which both looks and feels weak and cheap and i did completely loose the cover couple of times just by opening it
the display is indeed noticeably smaller than other palm models well comparing them side by side and if you have problems reading small letters it can be quite a disadvantage
i personally find the size adequate even for avantgo browsing and the docs i have mostly reference and dictionaries books i still prefer in print
readability is very good with soft overhead even light outdoors in the supermarket type conditions etc
but sometimes the display surface has a nasty glare and the faceplate thickness shades the edges making some parts hard to read
the backlight is useful only in very dark conditions otherwise there is just not enough contrast to read the display
memory is small but if youre planning to do lots of work on your palm like spreadsheets and such you will anyway go for a bigger display and thus more memory of iiixe or vx
i have all my  contacts business and personal about  so far couple of months of activities several nice games and necessary documents and ok two books just for the fun of it avantgo with  channels  and still some  kb left
btw there is a memory expansion advertised on palmcom a  mb backup module with  mb coming soon from the same company
so on the long run youll be able to expand if your needs grow
as i understand it is not the same thing as the visor flash memory module but some swapping needs to be done still if your life is so busy and fast paced you are probably making lots of money and can get a second organizer like vx or sony clie
finally i wasnt so bothered by the absence of the hotsync cradle
my desk is way to cluttered anyway so the cable does the job
also as a mac user i had to invest into the usb cable  which works without a glitch on g os  very easy to use software works great sync was no problem
if you are not looking to spend alot and the mb is enough
this is a nice pda for the moneyam using the car charger with a garmin etrex legend and it works just like it should
i can use it on car trips without worrying about the batteries running down be aware that it does not charge the batteries just powers the garmin so the batteries are not used
a separate battery charger is needed
main complaint is that the charger is specific to only my garmin etrex and that all companies are doing the same thing
presently i have to travel with a charger for the garmin one for my cellphone and another for my ipod
as a result i own six chargers three for the car and three for the wall
and add three more cables for connecting each to the pcalthough the etrexes were really designed for use in the outdoors i use it in the car to help predict distance to go etc and if i have the local map downloaded to it it has helped me out of binds on a couple of occasions
if you use it in the car you really want this adaptor to save your batteriesnot only will it save the batteries but i can operate my legend in normal mode to get better position from the waas data
battery saver mode precludes the use of waas and normal mode can really drain the batteries rather quickly
btw there is no scientific reason for reception to be better because of using this adapter
the cord is generously long
in fact it can get in the way sometimes but may allow the unit to be passed to the back seat so your back seat navigator can monitor iti have only two minor complaints
the first is the price
the garmin legend gives a lot of feature for the price but garmin seems to make up for it with the price of the accessories
it seems this adaptor should cost half what it doesthe second is that the fuse is accessed by screwing off the center of the cigarette plug and the center piece has unscrewed itself on a couple of occasions now leaving several small parts strewn about
i had to dig in my glove compartment this weekend for all of the little parts and am waiting for the day i lose one for good
so be careful that the center is always screwed ini use this with the suction cup mount which works quite well on glass
but again seems kind of expensive for what it isbought this to mount a etrex hcx to my dirt bike
at first i freaked out because it included a new back cover that fits into the handle bar clamp
that cover does not fit the hcx
but then i realized my etrex hcx came with the snap on piece that that fits into the handle bar clamp
the rubber spacers work great keeping the unit tight on the handle bars
however the gps rattled a little bit once in was snapped into the handle bar clamp
i put some black tape inside to take up the space and its all good now
i just figure with all the bumps that come with trail riding i did not want the unit to rattle around
overall looks like a sturdy product
glad to have my gps mounted now so i dont have to keep pulling it from my bagi had to use a dremel tool to grind away at the inside to allow clearance for the legend hcxs micro sd card slot
this was a simple task and only took a minute but if you do not have a dremel tool or doubt your skills you might want to skip this mountonce the modification was done this mount seems like a great unit for the price and im very happy with itbtw garmin lists this mount on their site as an accessory for the hcx however the packaging for this mount lists  gpss as being compatible with this mount and the legend hcx is not one of them
so which mount is the right one for the legend hcx is still a mystery but this one will work with a slight modificationi have an etrex and was excited after recently purchasing a new road bike to pick this up
the unit fit on my handle bars without any problem after trimming the rubber mounts to sizenow that i have my etrex mounted on my bike i love using it
i have it next to the schwinn  function speedometer i have mountedi only have  issuesfirst the replacement battery cover does not fit any etrex that can house a minisdcard
i actually had to use my dremmel to cut away at the plastic where the card would mountonce i did that getting the battery case on with the metal twist lock was extremely difficult
it was as if they made the metal lock about mm too short
eventually after overcoming my frustration and fear of breaking the gps unit from using the original sealed back it clicked into place
but i did have to wrench it pretty hardi probably wouldnt trust it to be water prooftight anymore but its on my bike not a boat or for use in the rainif garmin would make one to actually fit their gps id be more than happy to purchase that onei rated this a  out of  because im not impressed
it does the job of holding the gps
it does require replacing the back of the gps to get correct mounting
easy installation on handle barsi bought this for my new etrex vista hcx for use with my mountain bike during those non crash style rides
this mount is intended to replace the back cover of your gpsr and then clip onto the handlebar mount
i discovered that the replacement cover is different than the original one in several ways
first it is all plastic with a much smaller delicate oring seal than the original cover which is made out of metal and has a beefy seal system
more importantly the new cover does not fit on the hcx or others with microsd cards
hmmm
i was ready to return it and i remembered that my new vista hcx came with a screw mount auxiliary mount adapter that the instruction manual for the hcx says do not discard
lo and behold screw that baby onto the original sturdy beefy oring sealed metal back and it clips onto the handlebar mount perfectly
this is much better than the replacement back that comes with the mount kit
now i have an unused back cover for any non hcx design etrex to sell
garmin does sell just the bar mount piece for suggested retail  so i lost money on the deal but i dont have to return anything and my mount is stronger than the original design that garmin had
i only deducted one star for the quality of the kits plastic replacement back cover that nonhcx users will have to usei just bought a new specialized road bike with standard handle bars and this mount did not fit
i know i should have read the tech details fits handlebars up to  inch and then measured my bike but i figured it would fit a standard bikeany advicethe mount consists of two pieces
one piece fastens onto your handlebars
it attaches very firmly and will prevent the unit from moving even over the roughest terrain
the other piece replaces the standard battery compartment cover on the gps
when you want to mount the gps to your bike you just snap the two components togetheri was impressed by the quality of the pieces and suspect that it will be very durable
i only have two negative comments regarding this design
first the handlebar mounting piece is tightened on via a screw
i have a road and a mountain bike and will want to switch the unit between the two
i would have preferred some sort of quick release mechanism that does not require the use of tools
secondly i wish that the battery cover did not have to be replaced with the new one
the one that comes with the bike mount is not rubberized and it has a clip on it that could catch on things
that means that youll want to put the original cover back on the gps if you want to use it as a handheld
having to use two different covers means that there is just one more piece that youll need to remember to bring on your trips  and one more thing to possibly lose somewheredespite these gripes i am very impressed with the mount and can recommend itive been using gps for over a year and ive found that i get the most enjoyment from it when its strapped to my bicycle
this attachment makes getting the gps on and off a snap
i have found no problems with it to date
in fact ive made the mount that replaces the battery cover a permanent replacement
the mount attachmentbattery cover even fits in my gps protective case  asin bvx bought it for use with my vista hcx
one needs to screw on a bicycle mount adapter to the back cover of the original hcx back
that mount adapter is one of the accessories that comes together free with the vista hcx
it is needed to fit the vista hcx onto this bicycle mountfor now the plastic cover is useless as its only for non x versions of the etrex series
but anyway looking at it the vista hcx battery cover is much better with the rubberised insulation
the hcx bicycle mount adapter itself is also better as it has a larger lever than the one in the cover supplied in this productas for the bicycle mount it fits perfectly with my mountain bike
those with larger tube diameters can by the large rail mount adaptergarmin large diameter rail mount adapter for users who have an etrexvistalegend x versionswith microsd expansion i suggest buying this insteadgarmin rail mount adapter 
the search for garmin bicycle mount didnt turn this up because its a rail mount which is half the price of what i bought here
one will still need the plastic bicycle mount adapter accessory that came with the gps deviceeasy to mount
secure  i have mounts for my road and mountain bikes
the only shortcoming is that there is no adapter for oversize handle bars or for the bicycle stem
these options would substantially increase the options for mountingi planned buying it for mounting my etrex venture on my motorcycle
none of the reviews here could help me in getting rid of my worry will it fit in my handlebar
i assumed it will so i purchased it
the result
perfect fit
using the thick rubber strap i could securely attach the handlebar mount and the gps clickedin in a snap
naturally theres a lot less vibration on a streetroad motorbike handlebar than that on a mountain bike so that would not be a problem for me
i was wrong since i noticed several times gps suddenly turned off while riding
so be careful cause battery lid can actually provoke false electric contacts from time to time turning the gps off
i got through this by placing a thin piece of foam over the batteries which made the lid to close tighter and solved the problemthis device has proved very useful in taking my etrex along for bike rides
it fits nicely on small diameter handlebars not so well on expensive mountain bike handlebars which have a larger diameter but thats why garmin makes a larger mount
it doesnt slip when riding over rough terrain and it holds the gpsr securely
if you have an etrex with a memory card you will have to use the bracket that came with your etrex the onepiece back that comes with this bracket wont fit
if thats the case you will need to check the tightness of the screw fairly oftenall in all a nice productappears to be well made
easy to fit
i wont give it  stars though because i think that  is a lot of of money for a small plastic bracket and a slightly modified battery compartment cover especially when the etrex only cost me  over five years agoand was very easy to install
however it may have been better to use a cliptype attachment rather than a screw to allow for easy mobility between placements
once its on your bike thats where its staying would be nice just to unclip attach to an oar then back on the bikegarmin bicycle mount for etrex and summit at first i thought it was all good
then while on a ride i noticed the etrex rattling in the mount
upon close inspection it was not tight as the original back
plus the original back is coated with rubberized material
which makes it a fairly water tight and snug fit
the replacement back is just plastic
no rubberized coating and thus no water proofing and no tight fit
needless to say i was very disappointed in the quality of the product
i had to use plastic black tape around the opening to stop the rattle
but there is no protection from wateri dont understand why the inside of the back was not designed to have either a gasket or rubberizing to protect it from waterbut that being said
it is still the only option for mounting it to the handle bar of a bike
and that job is well done
good heavy duty mounting with lots of extra rubber spacersi would give it  stars if i could use this on my bike that has   handlebar diameter
there is no oversize versioni had to cut some of the plastic insert and insert my own to make it fit and not sliptook a little work to get the screw into the nut sounds crazy but yes  it can be a little tricky if not closed flushthis was a suggested item from amazon when i purchased the garmin etrex legend hcx
the handle bar mount will fit all etrex except for the hcx model because the memory card makes the back case a different size
was still able to use the handle bar mount because of the adapter that came with the gps
if you have the hcx just order the handle bar mount without the battery pack
it will save you  and do the same thingno complaints at all
make sure you get the right case for the many garmin models
this is not an easy tasknice case well made great for using while hilking or walking
clear plastic over view window and a velcro closurenice high quality and fits the etrex like a glovei use this case for my garmin etrex  it fits in the case okay but it isnt exactly tight
it defiantly wont fall out but it would be nice to see garmin improve the fitment for this product
all in all a great buy gives my gps more protection and allows me to clip it onto my bagi received this last week and even though the bike mount would not fit the carrying case fits pretty well
the toggle button is partially covered up but i think i can train it to fit betteri got this holder mainly because i wanted to be able to keep my gpsr handy wile hiking but out or the way and still recieveing
here is the deal i geocache and i do it quite often
when i used to go out on longer hikes i would loop the leash on my gpsr around the strap on my pack and then tuck my gpsr under the strap on my sholder where i couldnt see it but it could see the sky all that got me was a sore sholder and a gpsr dangeling by my waste not recieveing
now with the holster i leash the holster to my pack and clip the holster to my pack strar at about mid chest
i can see what i need to through the window of the holster and if i need more detail i just pull the reciever out so i can see the screen better
this set up keeps my reciever close at hand out of the way and recieveing when i dont need to see it and protected from scratches if you are a cacher you know your gpsr has lots of scratches
as for the window that everyone complains about i see it this way i would rather have to take out my gpsr to read it better than have to replace my gps because the window on it has gouges in it
look at this holster as insurance with the benifit of keeping the gps out of the way and it is a great bargain
untill someone offers tore up gps insurance this is the way to gocool material and it fits good
protects well but it is sort of bulky to have hanging off your person or to jam into a backpack with precious spacethis case fits well and works nicely to protect the gpsthe only issue i have with it is the stiching on the front window has started to come a little loose at the top
to be fair i could be the culprit as i tend to pull the top flap firmly when seating the gps into the pouch so it could be attributed to my own actionsit still works great i am just a little more careful about pulling on it now
the stiching is holding fine and the case works greatbe aware also that due to its design which is sort of necessary based on the key placement of the gps the top corners of the gpsr are still vulnerable to drops
so if you want something to completely surround your gps this isnt it
i wouldnt object if they cahnged the design slightly to widen the top flap so that it would reach the corners a little moreoverall a great little case for the moneyjust an everyday case nothing to fancy but it does fit well
exactly as described
great fast shipping
there are however better ways than this to carry your handheldthis product is basically a good one
my only complaint was that the clear plastic that you look through to see the unit often fogged up in wet weatherour boy bought the garmin  to keep from getting lost while using the qdgwp  metal detector
im thinking this is not the end of itthe carring case protects from scratches and you can carry it on your belt by your side
you can operate the gps with out taking it out ofthe casethe case is well made and functions as described
the plastic screen protector makes reading my gps a little more difficult
also the side buttons on the etrex are not easily accessible with this case
i end up taking the gps out of the case when im using it frequently
its great to keep your gps looking new and for packing it awayvery well built and very protecting
its only weakness lies in that you can not plug a pc cable or v cigarette lighter power supply cable without taking it offthis little case cover does the job
the best feature is the clear plastic front that protects the lcd screen
the belt clip on the back is somewhat useful but ive found that it clips better to a shoulder strap on a backpack better than on a belt loopusing the carrying case with an etrex and have no complaints about fit hard to use buttons or screen protection
would like to have a combination closed loop and clipon instead of just the beltclipi havent really had a chance to use the case yet but it looks like it will do the jobi noticed several negitive reviews for this case that focused on a problem with the case apparently being too deep for the vista resulting in it covering over several of the operating control buttons on the gps itself making the device difficult to use while cased
i have to say that either this reported problem has been corrected or the reviewers commented on the wrong case
the vista hcx etrax that i bought fits just right in this casei very much like the d ring on the back of the case
this allows the gps to be lashed to an equipment loop on your backpack or some other convenient place
i would give this case a star rating but for the fact that i do not much trust the belt hook provided on the case
though it has not happen to me i fear that the gps could slide unnoticed off a belt and be lost if a backup means of attachment were not usedthe overall construction of the case appears to be sound
the case should provide adequate protection for the etrax unless it is severly abused and beaten up beyond what one might expect from normal use which does not include throwing it and having the dog retrieve it or dunking it in a river to see how many times you can do that before it fails
you get the ideaanyway  great product
worth the moneywhile the whole package is a bit bulky the etrex device seems more protected and easier to grip and hold securelythis case is excellent
i recommend it
i bought it for my gps and because its leather
very good
anice case fits the unit well
i have used it  times and clips to the belt nicely with the unit coming out and in with now problems
off the the belt as well it provides good protectionthis is a perfectly designed case for the etrex legend
joystick is easily accessible it fits snug and the belt clip is nice and secure
my only complaint is the plastic window to protect the lcd
its pretty thick and seems like it scratches pretty easily and makes the lcd more difficult to read with the heavy glare
otherwise its a good thing to have to protect your gps from invetible drops and abrasiongarmin gpss have fairly good battery life but after a couple of days of using your garmin in a car the batteries are going to be dead
drive a long distance in one day  hours and the batteries in your garmin will be dead
this can be very anonying if your out rving or offroading for the weekend or the weekso garmin has fixed this problem by making a cigarette adapter and pc interface cord that attaches to your garmin gpsnow you can cruise around all day with all of the features of your garmin gps turned on and dont have to worry about the batteries dying
i think that is a big plusmy only complaint is that i wish the cord was longer
its good length but some how i feel that i am going to need a longer cord one day and its going to annony me that it is notso if you drive alot with your garmin gps get this and save money on batterieswell i bought this free a few weeks ago with rebate
what else can you say about a free optical mouse
but just ignore the rebate i own this optical mouse and another one microsoft wheel mouse optical
they are comparable in price but this logitech one is clearly the better choice
more responsive comfortable accurate better feel better look   logitech products havent disappointed me so far
i guess no matter what bill does microsoft cant stiffle competition here
microsoft is just not that great on hard warei gave only  stars because this mouse is not perfect of course
more  can buy you a better mouse
but this is a great value for the money even without rebatea solid performer good resolution no problem with most surfaces
only three buttons two regular  one push down the wheel
have three of these on various computers  never had trouble  except with logitechs enhanced mouseware on nt so i cant program the middle button thereive been auditioning the replacement to my hockey puck for some time
i first tried logitechs trackman optical with the thumb trackball
that worked great except for a couple things
for simple internet use it was great but im a graphic artist and i need something i can draw and trace around things with and the marble wasnt cutting it with my naturally nervous hands
drawing in macromedia freehand with it was a nightmare
so since it didnt meet my needs  i took it back and found this one
its basic and theres nothing wrong with basic for those of us who like simplicity
i got the blue one it comes also in red which goes really well with my purple computer
i have two buttons now the right one i programmed for doubleclick
makes me feel like a real pc person
ha
speaking of which it comes with a green adapter for a windows device i will never use so ive got a spare if anyone wants one
one should be warned never to pick the mouse up and stare at its underside because thats a laser beam
the mouse glows red every time you put your hand on it
best feature is the scroll wheel
however ive found that theres a bug of some kind with my netscape  when you push on it
using it for a back button calls up a new blank windownot much help so do it the oldfashioned way
also ive noticed it crashes the computer on occasion not sure why
one less star for that
the mouse will point and click without the mouseware software but if you install it you can program the mouse and scroll
its also the same software you get with the trackman so no need to reload for it
all in all its a vast improvement over the mouse ive been using for three years and im not a gamer so i dont need it to have bells and whistles
now if i could just find a bigger keyboard with usb ports and a power button that doesnt cost an arm and a legi used to be a huge fan of ms intellimouse the old fashioned  button with wheelbuttonthis feels just as good despite the fact that it doesnt look as ergonomicthe price is very reasonablethe wheel is much more reliable than msintellimouse
its faster and doesnt wear as quickly i play a lot of video games and surf the net a lot  that requires a lot of scrolling
ive never had to clean it  not onceand you gotta admit thats one nice shade of blue
very attractivestandard usb connection with an adapter to fit into psnote just because its optical and you can pretty easily use it on any surface ie
your desk a text book or your knee that doesnt mean you should
it picks up imperfections in the surface tooits better to use a mousepad regardless of how crappy
i find it works best with the soft cloth top not the plasticy onesi now own two of these style mice from logitech
my original mouse on my computer and now the mouse i just bought for my wifes computer
i use a mac g and my wife has a window me machine
both mice are great
i will never go back to a ball mouse againworks fine and was at a great price
if i were to get picky id say the click was a little too loudthis mouse worked pretty well and replaced a junky emachines bundled mouse that wouldnt function anymore
dont buy emachines anything unless you want to be ripped offthis recorder does its job well but be careful with it
the battery cover breaks easily if this thing is dropped or knocked around
if it were more sturdy especially the battery cover  latch i would give it five stars
a great broken recorder is still brokenthis recorder is another good pearlcorder by olympus but it drops some of the features i found really useful that were in the old l
i use mine for note taking and general short less than an hour recording chores
on the old l you had an index marker to but on that recorder the indexer stopped the tape motion when ever it hit an index mark
on the j it only gives you a loud sound and you must release the rewindfast forward button to hear the recording
also the fast forward speed is so slow that the index mark doesnt sound and so you lose fast forward index search
it only works in rewind
this might be the result of changes made to the rewindfast forward system
its a sliding lever now not buttons as on the old l
its not a bad little recorder i think the changes made to the tape handling chassis have really reduced the overall value of this recorder
another thing that one needs to remember is the j only has auto shut off in playback and recording mode onlyand at end of tape but not in rewind or fast forward as the old l use to
so if you place it in rewind or fast forward and something comes up in which you forget its running it will get to the end of the tape and doesnt turn off
not normally a bad problem but just one more thing you lose from the l
i think dropping the more useful features and changing the tape handling chassis reduced the overall value of this recorder especially since olympus stopped making the l
for that reason it gets  stars instead of fivethis radio is a classic choice for offroaders because its simple and works great
dont expect a tuckload of features with this unit  you get automatic noise limiter squelch control volume and channelchanging knobs thats it
unless youre driving a bigrig youre not going to need a more expensive radio cb effectiveness is based more on your antenna setup and proper tuning than the radio itselfnote if you want a public address pa option go for the pro
its the same unit as this except with pai needed a small cb radio for my truck i  have manual transmission a  speed i also have a ham radio a alinco  radio i needed a small radio to go next to my  this one fit perfect more than satisfactory for my needs i will include a picture of my setup sooninstalled this in a toyota tacoma with a firestick firefly antenna
easy to get the swr set and have had nothing but compliments on this radios audio
running it barefoot with the stock mic eventhis is a very good radio
when you factor in the price and the size its really great
the price does seem to fluctuate some but most of the time it is only  more than the  but offers a public address function and more importantly adjustable receive rf gain
this is very important in my opinion
am communication is very badly hampered by electrical noise
cbs can be very bad about picking up lots of noise from the vehicle especially now with more electronics going into vehicles every year
luckily this radio has a very good automatic noise limiter anl which is very effective in reducing overall noise
combine that with the ability to reduce the sensitivity of the radio by turning down the gain and you can reduce the noise very much when you dont mind the sacrifice in picking up weak signals
when you are trying to pick that signal up out of the noise you can then turn the gain up
you will increase the noise but also amplify that signal possibly making it readableone thing to be aware of is that the hand mic for this radio is very small
smaller than your standard cb size microphone
swapping this out isnt necessarily the easiest affair either if you dont select a power amplified microphone
a standard non powered microphone such as an astatic l will not work with this radio you will have terribly low audio
your best bet is to stick with stock or use a power mic like the astatic road devil or d which will get the audio up loud enough for the radio
a replacement mic from a xl will also work well and is a large size but still has the look of a cheap stock microphone which many people dont likein summary this radio packs a lot of performance into a small package that many other radios just cant match
modern vehicles just do not have the space that the older vehicles do and the small form factor of this radio makes for an easy install
if you like the chromed out big radio look this might not be for you
if you want a simple small clean looking durable radio with a good feature set then this would be a good fit for youi found that cb is not as useful as it was  years ago for travel
on a recent cross country trip it helped me find out what was causing  major traffic delays but in both cases it did not give me a timely warning to avoid them
still its nice to have as a back upinstalled in no time flat
great sound output simple to use and looks good in my black interior jeep
i would give it five star but it doesnt have weather channels
still a great product at a great pricei bought this hoping to connect with some people on the road
no such luck
the unit is nice and compact easy to install and works quite well
i enjoyed setting it up drilling holes in my car positioning the antenna etc
im hoping to get my friends to buy a cb so i have someone to communicate withi received this unit less than a month ago and gave it  stars
then it failed on me and i had to send it back
amazon replaced it with their usual superior customer service
many of the comments appear to be from professional reviewers so i read them with a grain of salt
no matter what people say youre not going to get over  miles on  watts of power
here are my pros and conspros  its a small unit with many useful features
anl gain volume and squelch controls on the front and a pa outlet on the rear
when i first hooked it up i had an almost perfect impedance with my swr meter
it gave out  watts and had crystal clear audio
i cant impress enough that a good antenna is imperativecons  the stock mic is cheaply made with passable modulation
the mic cord is very short but i can live with that
since linear amps are a nono get a decent power mic if you want to be heardi use this on rallys its small and discreet easy to remove and install back again
doesnt have amazing range but good enough for me
i use in combination with the little wil antenna
waaaaayyyy better than any of those handheld radios and fantastic for checking the route ahead if you can get in touch with a friendly trucker or twoi put this on a  jku for offroad use
its perfect
small footprint inside the jeep but the mic pics up well and the speaker is plenty loud
be sure to match this with a quality antenna i used a  ft firestik and ground it
i mounted with a rr spare tire mount and have a swr of  to i bounce around a lot with this setup off road and never had issuesthis is one of the good one all the good capabilities and a very good price for this radio as good and a better price
very effective mike controli installed this into my  dakota and it works great
i didnt give it  stars simply because im not an expert on radios but for casual daily use while driving it works wonderfully
it is paired on my truck with a k in antennae but i am planning on upgradingthis is a very good mouse overall
it glows which was a nice surprise but i dont find that it heats up at all
it fits your hand nicely and the rd button is easily accesible but can not be pushed accidentally
i find the rd button is most useful when you set it to execute the back function of your browser
sometimes however for no apparent reason the pointer sticks in one space or moves around on its own
other than that it is an nice mousemy conundrum when purchasing this mouse was whether to purchase the microsoft one or the logitech one
i took a chance on the logitech mouse and i must say that i have not regretted it
not only is logitech mouse less expensive than the mouse created by microsoft but it is also of about equal quality
aesthetically the logitech mouse looks great one of the coolest features is the glowing blue logitech logo on the back to the mouse
installing it was a breeze i just plugged it into my usb port and windows auto detected it and installed the appropriate drivers automatically
although overall this is a good mouse it does have some problems
the wheel feels flimsy to the touch and scrolling is a bit difficult
if you heavily use the scroll wheel you should consider the microsoft mouse
although the logitech mouse does not give you as good a feel as the microsoft mouse it is adequate nonetheless
another thing that you might find difficult with this mouse is getting adjusted to it in the beginning
it takes a while to get adjusted to the shape of the mouse but after a few days it will feel natural
i would recommend this mouse for anyone seeking a new mouse and is looking to purchase an optical mouse
once you have tried optical you wont want to go back to the regular ball mousei bought the mouseman optical after reading lots of reviews
i am very pleased with it
i have tested it in unreal tournament and it works very well except for a few scroll wheel issues which can be fixed with a patch
i am one of the flick gamers and i found no problems with the mouse other then the scroll wheel
the only time the optical camera failed me was when i move it as fast as i can to test it but you must move it faster then you will ever need to
to achieve the speed to fool the camera you must move so fast you cannot use the mouse for any operation
the mouse shape is very comfortable and fits my hand very well better then the explorer
although i like the scroll wheel of the microsoft mice because they feel better i would still go with this mouse because it is better and easier to gripthe reason i gave it  stars instead of  was because of the scroll wheel
when scrolling in internet explorer i found there was a slight lag between i turned the wheel and when the page started scrolling and that the scroll was choppier then the ms micea mouse is a rather personal decision
peoples tastes and requirements  when it comes to mice and keyboards vary greatly upon what they do with  their computeri tend to be very hard on mice the logitech mouseman  wheel optical is my third mouse in  months
thus far i am very satsified  with itthe ups great feel
my previous mouse was the ms intellimouse  explorer the grey one
in contrast the ms mouse felt very cheap to me
the tactile response on the logitech is much better the buttons have a  nicer click feel
in fact the thumb button on the ms mouse broke  stuck on of course which lead me to try this one
how it illuminates  was also a nice surprisethe downs logitech makes a great piece of  hardware but i do not like their drivers as much as the ms mouse
the  logitech drivers do not work in all games the same way as the ms drivers  do
some games do not even register the wheel turning very  disappointingoverall probably the best mouse out there for the cost  or regardless of cost for that matter
i love the feel and would  recommend this mouse over any other that ive used to this pointive had this camera for about  years nowpicture quality takes great pictures outdoors and indoor pictures with adequate lighting flash is not adequate
pictures with flash are horrible
they come out all blurry  the shutter speed isnt fast enoughccd not good enough when using auto settingsuse i like having the ability to change the fstop setting on the fly with the knob on top of the camera
sure beats using the menus the battery lasts a long time but its always good to have a spare especially if you use lcd alotconstruction solid ive fallen on this thing while skiing back of case is cracked and took it with me when i accidentally fell into lake tahoe camera was submerged but amazingly it still workssummaryive taken thousands of pictures with the camera
certainly got good use out of it over the past  yearshowever newer cameras have better flash capability and record in video
my friends have the canon sxxx series
they are  the size of the kodak and perform much betterpros vivid colors astonishing picture quality and details great design and ergonomics usb connectioncons battery drains fast bad focus in lowlight conditionskodaks dc gives you easy access to manual functions offers a direct usb connection to download photos to desktop and notebook more sturdy than other cheap cameras accurate colors that rivals film cameras
having access to higher resolutions such as  mega pixels is is important as well bc you want your picture to be sharp and crispergonomics are great and your hands will feel at home when using it
the casing feels very solid but the two plastic doors for connectivity and the memory card looks like they could break at any timehere are the functions accessible manually   selftimer to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself
 burst mode to take  pictures in sequence at the lowest picture quality you can take up to 
 landscape to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus
 closeup to let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between  feet in great details
 flash and flash settings will let you chose between flash no flash redeye   exposure compensation from  to  this will let you chose to over or underexpose your subject to adapt to various light conditions
 aperture f f f you can decide on the depth of field so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos
you can also choose p for the automatic settings to take over
 zoom inout you get a x physical zoom and also a x digital which adds up to the x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough
you could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode to prevent yourself from using it i have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom theyre always grainy not only with the kodaks digital zoom but with all those i triedthe kodak dc comes with a  mb compact flash memory card which is a complete nonsense for a  mega pixels camera
you should buy at least  mb
amazon has great prices on thisthe bad part of the dc is its inability to focus in lowlight conditions
it rarely focuses on the subject but looks for any source of light and focus at that pointthe main complaint with the dc goes to the batterykodaks proprietary liion battery thats used in the dc doesnt impress at all
with the lcd on it doesnt last more than  pictures after which the lcd turns itself off
get a charger and solve your problemsall digital cameras have their shortfalls but this one has the least
its simply amazing when you consider the pricethis is kodaks entry into the  megapixel market and some reports indicate that this is the first of kodaks digital cameras to be designed  by kodak japan and considering that kodak did so well at mp with the  dc one expects a formidable digital camera and gets it for the most  part
this is my second kodak digital camera and ive continued to  purchase kodak because with digital cameras the camera is also the film and  no one knows how to make film quite like kodak a la kodachrome
the  previous dc is a point and shoot camera only and while the dc  offers manual control of many functions it still basicaslly a point and  shoot camera  for instance with the dc no control of focus is  possible and if you want to change shutter speed you have to go through  several levels of menu no less than  button presses to get to the  shutter speed menu and then as much as another  to choose the speed
hopefully as the digital era progresses digital cameras will become more  like the slrs of old with manual control of every function and all the  controls on the body of the camera rather then buried deep in menus
i  understand olympus is about to release its e which is like a digital slr  however the price will be about 
that given lets examine the  kodak dcthe positives for me after the mp resolution and the  x lens what impresses me most about the dc is the high quality high  contrast high resolution high brightness backpanel lcd which is now  truly useful unlike that on the dc
the backpanel controls have also  been improved somewhat with a  axis quotjoyquot button
the camera has  a strap post on each side of the body so one can use a neckstrap the  widetelephoto control is a quotwigglequot switch under the thumb and  the viewfinder has a diopter control for those of us needing glasses
the  dc communicates with the computer through usb only and unlike the  dc can be used at the same time as other usb devices and acts just like  a flash card reader appearing to the computer as a external removable  drive with the fast downloading of a reader
the front of the dc lens  is well protected unlike the dc
the manual is typical kodak well  done but strangely enough as with the dc manual the markings in the  viewfinder are not explained
exposure after pressing the shutter button  in almost instantaneous and despite the larger file size of a mp file  saving the the file to the cf is considerably faster that the dc
digital zooom is surprisingly good thanks to the mp high densitythe  negatives i was very surprised to find that the lens barrel appears in  the lower right corner of the viewfinder at mm i dont know if this is  not unusual for a point and shoot as ive never owned one before but i  come close to finding it unacceptable
the battery situation with the  dc is not much improved so far as i can tell even though the camera  uses an expensive proprietary
kodak lithiumion battery the user will  surely have to invest in a  battery and charger kit if extended and  awayfromthehome use in anticipated
like the dc the battery cover  of the dc can be knocked open by a blow to the bottom of the camera  body  those comtemplating active use should secure the battery cover with  tape
the dc is supplied with only a mb cf card and the buyer can  expect to spend an additional  on a large cf card which along  with  the  extra battery and charger will amount to an additional   investment
the camera acts only as a cf reader and is not twain  compliant which leads to lots of inconveniences in saving files
the  backpanel lcd gets dark in sunlight
as with the dc the tripod mount  is plastic and apparently not intended for serious useone additional  comment  those buying a digital camera should check back with the  manufacturer for updated firmware  in kodaks case there were lots of  early complaints about battery life problems with the dc which were  largely solved with later firmwareit is a great item for hiding unsightly wires but not more than  wires in one lines or it wont close
use a roller brush to paint them and wish that there were more end unitsin my apartment i found myself in a rather awkward situation where i had to run cables all over the place
having found this cordmate kit did the jobtaking this off was difficult but i soon found using a hair dryer makes it come off easier
when you want to pull this off a wall use a hair dryer to heat the cordmate before and as you are removing it
there were still some black spots that stuck but not manythe tracks were not as large as i was hoping ive got an hdmi and a pair of  guage speaker runs in them and they cannot close
no biggie since the orientation hides the wires from sight
they were easy enough to cut to length and there is plenty of elbows and corners to make it work over a decent runproduct dimensions lend very well to easily blending into the background and easy access to addsubtract cables in the run as neededit made the cables going to my tv look much more professional
i was barely able to fit a power cord hdmi cable and a coaxial cable
the only thing that prevented me from giving it  stars was the corner u shaped piece and the t piece was a little tricky to install
you will not be disappointed with this productthis product works great to organize and hide the cords coming from your tv
i would definitely recommend painting them the color of your wall so that it blends in and isnt noticeable
if you the actual electrical plug running from your television is too short to reach your outlet you will have to figure out another solution because the casing is too small to house the plug or extension cord ending
after installation i had plenty of casing left to use on another projecti was in need of cable runs to hide speaker wire along a ceiling beam
a few of these kits happily allowed me to do multiple complex angles and flush speaker wires against the ceiling and down to multiple speakersstar deducted because some of the adhesive material failed after around  months however i only had to replace one section and the rest has so far held up just fine
while no replacement for screwin rails these plastic runs work just fine for most home applicationsi mounted this on the wall and boy do they stick
dont try to take it off it will rip the paint its adhered to as well
once that badboy is pressed on its there for life
if there ever were a tornado in sacramento id hold onto this thing for dear lifegenerally the product is good and works as advertised
definitely more positive than negative however it is very hard to snap shut the tray once youve put the cables inside
i had to really work to get the tray closed in a tight place
also i wish they would be more specific about which other products match this one if you dont want to buy the full kit
i need one more  length of tray but am not sure which product to buy for the matching componentone more positive point  i used the adhesive backing to stick to distressed wood and brick
it seems to hold well on both of those surfaces which i was pleasantly surprised bythe product works i have two pairs of  awg speaker cables and a cat  ethernet cable running around five corners
it hides them well and the housing blends in nicelytwo things you might want to look out for the adhesive  very sticky
a good thing
but if you set it in the wrong place dont expect to be able to reset it without providing your own glue and tidying up the mess it leaves behind the first time the joints work very well if you dont set an edge of the housing flush against the skirting boardwallceiling they need a little extra wiggle room and if you apply the housing too close they wont click into placei bought a total of  cordemate kits and learned a few lessons during installation
like the old saying measure twice cut once a little care needs to be applied when installing mainly because the adhesive really sticks
once you peel off the backing and place it on a surface correctly or not youre not going to move it without some serious effort and regret
so plan and measure ahead wisely
some other reviewers have listed a few tips my own are  after cutting to size open the channel and place the wires inside before sticking to wall  be sure to allow space for the thickness of fittings  dryfit everything before final stickdown
once installed its a great improvement over dangling and unsightly wiresworks great and takes paint easily
the only bad thing is if you have to remove it they will take part of the wall with themit works great and looks wonderful but with an hdmi cable and power cable its a tight fitluckily thats all i have running to this tv so this solution wouldnt work for my living room tvluckily there is a larger one but id just hoped this one had a little more interior roomanother issue i found is the pieces to run it around corners are not the best
they didnt snap on like i thought they would but that might have been from too many wires runningthe pros   they give you plenty of material
i only used one link of it and have  left over
also the little elbows that come with it would make it easy to go around cornersthe cons   i wish the links would have been a little shorter
the instructions say you can cut them  perhaps for a man with tools that would work  but i definitely did not have anything i could have used to make the link shorterthis wire manager kit has everything you need elbows ft long rails etc but its way too expensive for a simple plastic product
it looks like its made in usa stated on the actual product packaging so i guess i dont feel too bad supporting us wait a minute a high volume sales plastic thing still made right here
wow now im impressed
anyway it works good sticks well to the wall looks good too
i was able to fit two  gauge speaker cables and a coaxial cable tv wire thru it and still manage to close the latch though a bit tricky
overall nice product
i have seen the real cheapo versions of these and this is better than those
a bit of advice installing lay down on your stomach when applying it right above your molding to be sure it is going on straight take your time or youll be pulling your wall down to fix itthis kit is pretty nice and helped me hide wiring that goes up along a wall to my projector as well as some speaker and sub woofer wiring around a door frame
the included  pieces of the cord channel were just enough for my application but just barely
one kit will probably not be enough for most applicationsthe pieces fit together nicely the connectors are handy and everything looks neat
the adhesive is fairly strong which i found out when i tried to unstick a piece of the channel because it was flush against the door molding and a connector wasnt fitting around it as a resulteach channel should comfortably fit  coax size cables but not too much moremy biggest gripe with the product is the quality of the plastic where the channel hinges open
when i got mine part of it was already cracked along the length of the hinge
while i was cutting another one shorter i pressed down on the top of the channel while holding it down and it just cracked through in that spot too
after that i was careful about how i held the pieces and avoided additional grief but perhaps the plastic should be a bit thicker or less brittle to prevent thisfortunately the cracks werent too visible and the product got the job done so only one star lostim hiding three medium thickness cords from my ceiling mounted projector in these and they really do the job well
it is a tight fit with three cords  i have to ensure that they are all perfectly aligned down the length of the mold but its not too hard to do
i havent bothered to paint them to match my wall yet but i like that the possibility is there
as far as the glue that other reviewers have mentioned it does seem very strong but in fact it fell about a week after installation
i think this was due to an unusually high amount of humidity making the initial adhesion weaker than it couldve been
whatever it was i simply reattached the molding to the ceilingwalls and theyve held firmly since then
just as an fyi i found these same kits in my local hardware store for the same price as i paid here  so dont feel like you have to wait on delivery if youre looking to save on the purchaseit works pretty much as described but the problem is that if you ever have to remove the pieces from the wall and move them then youre in trouble and if your power cord is a little bit short you have another problem
the adhesive on these is good but if you stick it on the wall and then have to move it maybe  inches over the adhesive may or may not stick
and if your power cord inside the plastic pieces is short and you have to put it at a slight angle to the outlet the pressure it puts on the plastic runners will pull it off of the wall
the thing i liked the  best about it was that the color matched my wall so you have to look hard to see it
and as long as you dont have to remove any piece from the wall and stick it somewhere else it works greatyou get  strips of plastic which can each hold about  cablesize wires
the strips have a self adhesive back to attach on the wallfloor
it also comes with a few elbows and connectors which is nice
only downside that cutting the strip short was a bit difficult
otherwise a good product and delivered as always on time and quickly by amazon
be prepared for it to be shipped in a larger than expected box some  longthe only reason i am giving it  stars is because the plastic is fragil and if you push to hard when installing it can crack pretty easily
other than that its a good product for a great priceits a pretty simple system that does just what it says
the channels in which the wires sit are adequate for maybe  to  wires depending on what type they are and seem fairly durable
the elbow connectors seems less durable and like they maybe liable to pop off if place somewhere where they may get bumped not a problem for me
my primary complaint is that the assortment of connectors may be insufficient for many applications if youre trying to navigate around a series of corners
i wasnt able to take the path i preferred on account of the limited connector options i could have used more of one type of connector and none of the others
but i knew what i was getting when i ordered itand a suggestion re the adhesive backing some reviewers have claimed that it is very difficult to remove should you ever desire to do so
i can see how this would be the case
the peelandstick adhesive certainly looks as if its intended to be permanent which is probably a good thing
since i may want to remove my wiremold in a few years and dont relish the idea of scraping several feet of adhesive off my wall i opted to score the adhesive a couple times every foot or two so that i could remove only a one or twoinch piece of the backing
most wires arent that heavy and a four foot run of this probably doesnt need four feet of adhesive to support it especially when its placed vertically
so only exposing an inch or two of adhesive every foot or two will hopefully save me trouble down the road and should be plenty secure in the meantimeas noted by others these cable covers are easy to cut mount and use
they are very easy to open used a flat head screwdriver and easy to put your cable and power cord into
if not stuffed with more than two cords they are easy to close tooalso as noted the adhesive is strong so have your channel in the right place before removing the protective film or else you risk it getting stuck in some undesirable position and making a mess if you try to move it
the film was easy to pull off with the channel sitting right in the place we wanted to install it so it should not be an issue if you do good prep workthe channels really look great in place
my only wishes would be  wish the channels were roomier as they max it one power cord and one cable or they wont close properly  wish that the tjunctions and corner elbow covers could be made a bit oversized i had to use a cablesplitter at a t junction and had to run an small twoprong extension cord to an elbow and both remain uncovered as the respective covers are just too smallall considered good product that i would recommendthese wire hiders are great and the adhesive is awesome maybe too awesome
i had to make some minor adjustments after the first install and not only did i pull off paint but also a couple layers of drywall
this really isnt a bad thing you want them to stick to the surface and do it well i just want to make sure i call it our for fellow renters
i was able to run  wires approximately  feet a sub woofer cable ethernet and x sets of speaker wire
it was a super tight fit but i made it work
be sure to run the wires before you stick to the wall as closing the seal is much more difficult once applied to the surfacei just got done installing this in my tv room and after a couple hours of swearing at it and trying to jam all the wires in it that needed to be in it my only conclusion is that this product is designed for  wires max
i needed to get the tv power cord hdmi cord and three  awg speaker wires through itand it took every ounce of patience i had to finish the job
the other issue is that once you stick this stuff to the wall it is permanent
it will rip off the paint texturing and half of the drywall paperso you better be committed once you stick it downother than that it looks good and works well as long as you only need to put a few wires in it
if i were doing it over again i would have gotten two kits a narrower one for the speaker wire runs single wire and a larger kit for the cable bundle that runs to the ampoverall it does its job
i had trouble with it sticking to the cinder block walls i found an alternativeim reducing my rating to  stars from  stars
it still looks great but as others have mentioned the doublesided tape on the back only lasts between  months and a year
ive had to put screws into the wall to keep these up
not a huge hassle but it wouldve been nice if it just worked as it came out of the box
that said im still buying more as its still the best system on the marketoriginal review belowthis kits extremely expensive but there simply arent a lot of options out there to keep your wires neat
if youre leaving it white you can have your wires neatly installed around an entire room in less than an hour
i cut mine with the cutting wheel of a dremel with no issues
besides the price i only have two complaints
first the kit comes with lots of unnecessary piecesconnectors
i wish there was a more cost effective way to purchase just what i needed
second if youre painting it plan on lots of coats
my home theater required these to be a deep red it took between    coats of a high quality paint it only took two coats on the walls to get a streak free finish
now that theyre up they look great you barely notice them at alli used many of them and painted them
they work great and look good but be carefull about installing them to make sure they are in the right place because if you want a slight modification in position you will take all the paint off
great productthese were easy enough to install
i used a hacksaw to cut them easily and a file to file the frayed edges and they look great
i did have them fall down off the wall once or twice so far but after pressing them back on they seem to be holding up okay
no regrets
if i need some more in the future ill probably buy another setwould have been nice to have one more long strip in this kit
seems they are designed to make you have to purchase additional separate pieces
i had just mounted my flat screen over my fireplace and needed the cords covered
the size worked perfectly across the top and down the sides but i was a little short and had to improvise a bit
it was nice the adhesive was already attached so all you have to do is remove the backingwe ordered these for our new apartment and i must confess i put off using them for a month or so because i was worried they would be a nightmare to install
not at all
it couldnt be simpler
youve got to think strategically about where you want cords to go and plan out before you cut but once you do thread them through peel off sticky and doneif i have one caveat its that you have to be careful with how many cords you put in each tube unless its just vertical from the device to the floor
horizontal or diagonal tubes that have heavy cords in them we found the weight of the cords is stronger than the adhesiveits a nice solution and not a very difficult one to use
well worth the money to make all those cords a little less unsightlyi bought two  fuji finepix a a few days ago and i have to say it is a good camera
it is accessible cheap and easy to use one big advantage is that downloads pictures really fastmaybe is not an impressive camera but it is very usefuli shopped around for digital cameras for a month before deciding on the fuji  its low price makes it a fantastic first digital camera and photo quality is excellenti bought the camera a few days before heading off to france on vacation and was up to speed on the cameras features within the first dayinstalling the program onto your computer is a bit of a beeyach but only took me a few minutes
ive never had any problems since installationmy biggest recommendation
get two sets of rechargable aa batterieslike most digitals the  eats batteriesi got the camera today and proceeded to try it out both at work and at home
i had no problems whatsoever setting up the drivers and software either on my imac at work or on my win machine at home
the cameras really easy to use the only possible drawback is that all the menu items appear as tiny little icons on the lcd screen  perhaps not a good choice for those with bad eyesight
weve been taking pictures all night and everything seems to be working out fine
obviously i havent tested it in all possible conditions and i know that battery life will be an issue
i did a lot of shopping around and this really did seem like the best bang for the buck
id definitely recommend looking around on the web taking your time reading reviews and deciding what youd like out of a digital camera
if however youre a novice user would like something thats easy to set up and equally easy to use id definitely recommend the finepix  the usb interface is quite speedy its lightweight and portable and picture quality is pretty good
id think about purchasing some rechargable batteries a carrying case theres no lens cap and perhaps a wall adapter especially if youll be using it for ebay or something like that
anice beginners digital camera with a lot of good deals out there if you look aroundthis camera is just great its very easy to understand and use the controls
inserting media and retreving it is also easyimage quality straight out of the camera without tweeking is great and people that dont use photoshop or dont know how end up getting great pictures hassle freebattery consumption is very good and while weve had the camera for over a month and picture taking averaging  to  pictures a day its still working fine with the original set of alkalines we boughti bought this camera as a gift for my  year old son and now he carries it everywhere he loves iteasy to use good documentation small amp practical design
great deal for a  megapixel camera
excellent for beginnersonly downside i found batteries run out fastthis camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures
they are very sharp and the color is great
it doesnt seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras i owned
the only reason i didnt give it  stars was because the lcd screen is kind of useless in bright light and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture but i heard that happens with some other cameras too
still i am very very pleased with this camerai was a little leary of buying one of these because i was spoiled by having a meg camera for  years but i was pleasantly surprised
first of all the battery life is much better than i had expected for an optical zoom camera
that alone made me very happy
the pictures are acceptable at  megs and as long as you arent looking for perfection they are good enough for most applications
finally it is relatively small and light and easy to carry arounddrawbacks the software included isnt intuitive at all
i wasnt even sure if i had installed the correct program
the camera menus are also a little hard to understand unless you read the manual a couple of timesnice piece of gear lots of notes here
the finder is a little frail for my likes but i do use it
it does provide convenience and a different camera prospective when using the finder
the little zoompower advance works well and lets you see more detail
on the same subject it also cuts out a portion of your screen when you view through it
i would still use it
the order came in timely and was undamaged
thank youthis is a great tool for those shots where you want to get down low
macro work and landscapewaterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without
i have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole timenow for the negative
it fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions
and the big one for me especially with macro work you loose some light when using the angle finder
so if you are already working in a lowlight situation this only makes matters worsebut in welllit conditions where fogging is not an issue and you want to shoot low this is an amazing accessory thus the  out of  starsprosmost likely the best accessory i have for my d
well suited for low angle shooting of flowers etcconsive found no way to secure the finder to the camera
i cannot trust it to stay on the camera while moving about in the outofdoors
also a little more friction would be nice as the finder is rotated around it tends to flop around far too muchupdate  for my canon d mk the same appliesas a replacement eye cupperfect
but do not expect it to have a diopter or any form of lens it doesnt
being used on a canon d i also purchased a special diopter to supplement the original equipment diopter
in reality i didnt need to but now i have a spare
in other words you can add a special diopter lens without the need to purchase thisthis eyecup does fit on the ti but it isnt like the original that came with it in two ways
one good one badfirst the bad its too wide
it does slide down but only with a little effort
once its on there its very snug
it also is wider than the original piece and really prevents you from using the little wheel on the right side of the viewer hole  or whatever its called
it also covers up most of the word display but not the display button
it does not interfere with the proximity sensor that shuts off the screen when you go to take a picturenow the good its too wide
yes same thing but in the good category its wider and therefore softer on the face in a larger more comfortable way
also the huge bonus is that the rubber surround is not loose and likely to fall off like the original eyecup
its a better quality of rubber and its glued to the plastic housingi was going to return it after realizing its not the one i was expecting but after a minute or two i realized its better even if it does cover that little wheel i never used
hope this helps any ti owners out there who lost that cheap rubber surround as quickly as i didworks as it should fits well with the same quality as the original oem version fits all eos versions that i havethis is a replacement eye piece for the xxd series for canon
i bought an extra to replace my eye cup for my rebel which are smaller
the rubber on these are stiffer and not as easily peeled off as the ones that come on the rebel series camerasbought a new slr camera without the rubber eyecup for eyeglass wearers
price was reasonable for an oem product
now i can use the camera without scratching my ar coated lenses in my eyeglassesthis is a nice little eye cup for the canon camera series
only drawback is that it slides off relatively easygreat price good quality eye cup just watch it for falling offfor a long time i wanted to get the flash off the camera and there are only a few options flash cord ste and radio transmitters to name a few the ste is a great compromise
it works great indoors it even works outdoors although not as good as indoors
it works  of the time if you are in a shaded area about  of the time in direct sunlight depending on distance i used it to shoot my daughter  feet away under some trees and it workedone point to take away is that you need line of sight even indoors if you place the camera in portrait mode having the camera sidewaysmake sure that the ste is on the correct side for example i was shooting a talent show and i had the flash on a stand on the left side of the stage i was in the middle of the auditorium and all worked great except when i placed the camera in portrait mode with the ste to the right so my hand and the lens were blocking the line of sight from the ste to the flashin conclusion i highly recommend the ste as a great way to start with wireless flashdoes not work well in bright sun but indoors and when dark the ir does well
i shoot weddings and local shows and lighting is always changing the ettl is a must and is also great as a autofocus assist really great in low lightwhile it certainly does the job of transmitting and metering the flash to an off camera or two flash in the eos ttl series im using a  ex and  ex i have also found some of the shortcomings if itdistance in a large room or outside is limited especially if you are attempting wide angles to the flashesit is also rather large and s lookingmy personal reccomendation is to save a few bucks and get an additional  or  flash
that would allow you to still offer the master function this provides as well as offer some front fill flash  just a thoughtafter owning this for almost  years i find i use the  on the camera and my  off the camera mainly on a side note i was able to use this unit with my two flashes for doing some very up close macro work with fish fry ad larvae  so aside from large group shots and studio work
this can make a big impact on macro work as wellvery easy to master buttons you will figure this out much quicker than all the functions of the large flash units
s styling and s buttons i guessnice producti faced some problems with sync is with more than one flasha lot of people here seems to think this thing is the greatest thing since slice bread and to a certain extent it is goodindoors
indoors in a small to medium size room with walls where the infrared signal can bounce around it works great
outdoors unless the transmitter has a good line of sight to the flashesnot so great
i would easily recommended this for indoor work
personally i am looking into some kind of radio trigger for the flashesthis is an unchanged  year old antique
the ste only controls groups a and b slaves
so another wireless method for the group c slaves to fire would be to have them attached to slave hot shoes and hope that no one else uses flash near the slaves
a better solution is to set another group a or b speedlite on manual and dial in the required outputflash exposure compensation fec can be set on a hot shoe mounted  series speedlite used as a slave trigger to control fec to compatible speedlite slave groups
the ste cannot perform this task
instead you can walk over to each slave and set the fec to achieve the same effectdirect line of sight indoors is usually not required
the buildings interior hard surfaces help in bouncing the wireless signal to the slavesthe stet comes with a black coloured pouch having the same rugged material as the  series pouchesto conclude one star was removed for the odd size battery which is not carried in all stores inability to control group c slaves lack of control over fec not a problem because the unit has rear buttons to adust the flash ratio in  stop increments for groups a and b slaves manual flash each slave must be individually set and stroboscopic flash each slave must be individually setthe canon ste speedlite transmitter is not as sophisticated as the nikon su wireless speedlight commander
the ste which doesnt come cheap is half the price and size of the more versatile  series speedlite used as slave triggersthe only reason i give this a  instead of a  star is that it could use some updates
ie
metal foot weather sealing to bring it up to current standards
this transmitter works great and does all that canon says it willnice to control flashes and play with light for creative photography keep in mind it need batteries which is not included and you need to order them separatelyits not a pocket wizard but for what its intended for itll do fine
the more i shoot the more i shoot full manual  radio poppers and pws are the way to go theresometimes though when we have people over i will set up  exs pointed at the ceiling and use the ste to capture group shots
works great  never ever fails to trigger the flashes
for portraits indoors i have been known to hide a flash behind a chair set to manual at  as a hair light and a main light camera right or left
the flash hidden behind the chair fires too with the ir signal bouncing off walls and suchfor fast adhoc throwdowns where i dont have time to set the shot up perfectly ill use this thing with ettl and let the camera meter the shots
this is what i imagine this thing will be best for clackering off quick shots without thought when time is tight let the cameras meter do the workso while this device is perfectly fine indoorsits outdoors that it starts to cool off  better at night oddly but still not great unless the flash units are pretty close to the emitter
i knew that going in though so ill limit my review to indoor stuff instead of  stars
that damn battery
this thing is showing its age using a cr battery
theyre expensive and sometimes hard to find
as for battery lifewell seemeanwhile the radio popper people state this device is use alongside their remotesi dont know how but im going to find outi have been using this unit to fire my ex and ex flashes
it works flawlessly indoors
it can auto focus in complete darkness and the flashes do not need to be in line of site
outdoors is another matter
its difficult to line up the sensors even at close distances
not that its impossible but it will require some patiencethis is great if you feel you dont need to bounce off tricky places
in a small room it will bounce to the target strobesif you need more range go for pocketwizardsi first bought this transmitter as an alternative to the pocket wizards
most of the work i do with this transmitter is outdoors
greats pretty good outdoors even if both the flash and the receiver are under direct sunlight flash has fired every single time
of course since it is an infrared wireless trigger system the only limitation you have is that the flash has to be in front or above the camera to be triggered
outdoors you have to be within a horizontal  working distance of  feet and you can be about  feet away from the flash within the horizontal working distance although most of us will be working within  feet of our subject
i would highly recommended
i even got to use it with an umbrella directly in front of the flash and the flash could still be triggered without any problemsi got this cord mainly for macro work so that i could use long macro lenses along with my flash without having to deal with the lens shadow in the picture
it is also very nice to be able to control the direction of the lighting by placing the flash above below or beside the subject
red eye can also be almost entirely reduced by moving the flash further away from the camera body so this cord is helpful for portrait work
it could be a little longer but the longer it gets the more difficult it would be to pack it small spaces so allinall i think they did a pretty good job
it works fine if you want all of your flashs functionally but dont want it in the hotshoe this is a good choiceyes way too expensive for what it is but its not made by anyone else and it does allow much more flexible usage of your flash unityescanon should have used metal foot given its price addon foot does the jobi also feel they could have used a bit more flexible cord as when you need to use full length like in your free hand it wants to pull back too muchrather than use just the replacement metal foot i attached a metal flex joint type foot that allows even more adjustmentwhat are you going to do 
you really need it and only canon sells it updatenew improved oce version out now even higher price to matchalso a couple of clones added to the market not sure of their qualityjan  updateitem is still working fine and has no broken partsi was somewhat hesitant about ordering this but after using it for a few weeks i like it
i would rather have something that fits into the camera body instead of mounting on the camera shoe
i have not had any problems with it so far
i also think like other canon products the price is a little steepgood for the purpose intended and is very well builtthe canon off camera shoe cord  is indispensable for those who use a speedlight bracket for portrait photography
raising the speedlight off the camera body helps eliminate hotspots redeye and lens hood shadow in flash photographycanon needs to make the cord much much longer dont know what electrical resistance problems this will cause to utilize directly as a master with umbrella lights
i must use the umbrellas as slave units  because of the short cord lengthone look at the set screws in the base reminded me of a problem pair of eyeglasses where the set screws backed out if you just looked at them wrong
a very careful application of clear nail polish over each screw has prevented problems others have had so far with the screws backing out
this etches the plastic  apply sparingly and carefullyim constantly checking tightening checking remounting this cord and speedlight interface to insure reliable function of my ex and ex speedlights  mounted on a flashbracket with an adjustable arm
flipping the arm back and forth for landscape and portrait picture formats  puts stress on the hotshoe and speedlight sides of the cord
after some failures  these compulsive actions become normal procedureif someone has a better cord  ill use it
in the meanwhile  if you use a flashbracket  you need this cordyou gotta have this if youre serious about flash photography
it makes a world of difference
if youre using your strobes on a stand youll need a longer cord than the base model
my next one will be longer but this model is good for things like hand held off camera shooting or for using with camera grips like the stroboframeusing a flash bracket allows the flash unit to be located away from the camera which reduces shadows and generally improves the quality of your flash photography
canons off camera shoe cord  is a convenient accessory that provides the required link between the cameras hot shoe and the flash brackets clampcord  is easy to use and is generally very sturdy however care should be taken to avoid putting excess stress on the critical screws that hold the components together
this applies primarily to the connector that the flash unit is attached to as this connector bears the weight of the flash unit and batterieswhen attached to a bracket and the camera is held horizontally in the landscape mode the flash unit is upright and the stress due to gravity is minimal
however when the camera is held vertically portrait mode the weight of flash imparts significantly more stress on the connector and the screws that hold it together
the affect of gravity on the flash unit tends to pull the connector apart
similar stresses occur when the arm of the bracket is rotated between the vertical and horizontal position or simply when the camera with the bracket attached is swung around
the housing of the connector is made up of two hard plastic sections held together by three tiny machine screws
over time stress and torque can cause these screws to work loose or even strip their threadsthe flash contacts area a second potential problem area
the flash contacts are mounted to a plate that is held in place by four screws located under the metal retaining clip that holds the flash unit in place after it slides in
under stress these screws can also work loose resulting in the flash failing to operate
tightening the screws will usually make the cord usable again but you may need to have a small screwdriver handy in case this happens during a shootin my case the four screws securing the contacts became loose causing my flash to fail to operate
by tightening the screws after every use i was able to continue using the cord a few more times until the connector actually split apart and broke
while the camera was in the vertical position the screws stripped out of the base of the connector
fortunately the wiring remained attached between the broken pieces because they prevented my flash unit from falling to the floor and possibly being damagedim on my second cord now and am constantly aware of any stress that i put on the tiny screws in that critical fitting
cord  is a great accessory but it definitely has a weak spot
care must be taken to minimize the stress that gravity places on the flash unit connector to insure that it lasts as long as possible
it is not an inexpensive item so buying replacement cords is a rather costly propositioni wanted to know the inside dimensions of this bag so i could lay out my equipment and determine if it would all fit before buying
i found the inside dimensions on several web sites but all were wrong
even canon exaggerates the inside dimensions
from those dimensions i was expecting more room than i got
i was expecting that my canon  f lens could sit on end in a pocket and it could but only with the bags inside cover pockets removed and with a bulge in the cover
i was also expecting my canon diii to sit face down with a shorter l zoom lens on it
that was possible but was marginal and wasted space on either side of the lens
nonetheless the bag worked out well for memy final design has my lensless diii on end in a pocket two l zoom lenses on end in similar sized pockets an l mm is macro in another pocket two nonzoom lenses stacked in another pocket and a collection of stacked lens hoods with the detachable camera strap inside of them in yet another pocket total of six roughly  diameter pockets
that leaves room for a x pocket across one end that holds the  f on its side on the bottom a piece of foam rubber over it and a flash and lens mount on top
i can put a flattened bean bag on top of all of this and get the cover zipped comfortably
i do have to be careful that the four permanent snaps on the inside of the cover left exposed by the removed inside cover pockets do not rest on anything of value
the bean bag helps with thisthe actual inside dimensions are  wide  deep and  long
a box exactly this size on the outside would probably not fit fully inside the bag but because the bag is a bit flexible and will conform to the contents it will hold the equipment that would fit in those dimensionsthere was no room left inside of the bag for my filters and the outside pockets would not accommodate my tamrack filter case so the filters are wrapped in flannel and tucked into the bottom half of an old sock and then into a side pocket
a mm pancake lens is also in a side pocket as are a charger and other accessories
im going to make a map of the contents of the side pockets and keep it in the main compartment so i dont have to unzip and root through four outside pockets to find what im looking forif you have canon f lenses  and  your fit will be a bit tighter than mine
the  should fit okay but the larger  will be tight in the end pocket
the longer pocket may need to be along one side instead of across an end of the bag
the  lens hood might also be problematic
if you have one fewer lenses you should be finethe side pockets could be a bit larger and less rounded but they are roomier than they look
the bag is excellent in all other respectsthe shoulder strap is nicely padded though this is not a bag most of us would want to carry very far on a shoulder if its well stocked
i will use it to store my equipment at home and transport it to the car and into a hotel and such
i generally only take the body and a lens or two in a holster or smaller sling bag when on a hike or other outing away from the hotel or carif id been able to ascertain the exact internal size of this bag before buying it would have been a five star purchase
instead its a four star purchase
i dont know why product listings often dont contain critical informationedit  ive uploaded some top view photos showing my gear arrangement
this should help you decide what you can squeeze into this bag
see the photo has has labelsthe used materials is durable and workmanship is good
the design  dimension is practical
the provided padding  partition is sufficienti have had this bag for about a year now and it is great for keeping a grab and go kit together
the comments about how many lenses you can really carry in this thing are valid
i carry mm ef on my d most of the time and i lug around a mm efs and a mm ef
i figure i have room for two or three small lenses like a macro tele extender or macro tube  or on big lense i think i can get a mm in there without much of a problem
i keep my battery charger filters cleaning kit etc
in the bag all the time
but if you know what type of shooting you are going to be doing then plan accordingly
if you filled this bag up with glass you would not want to carry it all day anywaymy only grip are the little metal clips creak a little but a few inches of electrical tape cured thislots of compartments
big enough for a d and seveal lenses plus manuals and other trinkets
quality constructon
rugged
was a tossup between a backpack and this bag still thinking about the backpackthis is far smaller than expected
it will not hold two cameras and lenses
only a body and very few accessories
having said that the build quality is excellent or outstanding whichever is better
if you do not need a lot of equipment this bag is great
camera with lens flash and a couple of smaller items will fit on the inside with pockets on the exterior for cards cables or other small itemsive had the bag for a little over  weeks now and am enjoying it welli can carry  canon dslrs quite comfortably with  lenses    and  and  flash only issue i have is the bag height  it is a little tight having the  mounted on a body and loading it verticallyoverall great price and sturdy build bag stays firm fully loaded and the nonslip shoulder pad keeps the bag secured when carryingwould definitely recommendthe bad feature of this product is that it does have one velcro pad on the inside that allow you to resize the storage compartments to your own personal needs the rest of the pads only have the velcro to adapt but it is very limited
i had the canon deluxe photo backpack eg for canon eos slr cameras its zippers were strong but difficult to manage so i changed it for this bag but im disapointed because of the difficult to design your own space the pads make it very limitedit can carry very well the tripods that are light
im buying a  pounds tripod and i dont know how is going to work in itthis is a very large camera bag and it has many pockets to store different items
it is very easy for a person to organize items with this bag
i saw another canon camera bag at frys electronics with a black rain proof bag
why didnt canon provide a bag with eg
other than that there are two straps at the bottom of the bag
i think the straps are for the tripod but i am not sure about that since even canons own website does not explain its design featuresnevertheless this bag feels fairly sturdy so  iam giving it four starsmy canon eg bag is stuffed and i have a canon d mark ii two very small film bodies and  lenses in my bag
there is no more room in the main compartment
it will not fit  bodies and  lenses plus a flash unless you have extremely small lenses that means no l lenses guys
and if you attach the hoods and keep them in their protective pouches just forget about it
nevertheless i do not need any more room so this bag is adequate
the strap can kind of be uncomfortable at times but if you wear good clothes youll get over it quicklythis gets  stars but canon needs to make a larger bag for people that have a few telephoto l lensesi like it for the same reasons stated by other reviewers so i wont repeat myself here
the part i worry about is something i discovered when i tried to adjust the dividers slightly  tried to rearrange one of them
as the velcro pulled on the fabric along the inner walls when i tried to separate them the fabric stretched so much that i thought i would tear it
i also wonder how long the fabric will last after years of use and enduring climate changes
however the outside of the bag is well constructed  provides sufficient space for the amateur camera enthusiastas im not a heavy user at this point i cant comment on its durability over time
other reviewers have raised legitimate concerns about the handle putting strain on the main zipper compartment since there is no attachment from the main handle to the body of the back to help distribute weight
i can see the strain breaking down the material over time
also i verified as one reviewer stated that canon provides no product warranty with their bags
those misgivings aside however i like how my items fit comfortably in this bag
its small enough to be very portable yet gives you enough space to fit quite a bit of equipment
while the overall dimensions are smaller the space allotted for each lens is larger than say the tamrac  for example
a quick aside on bag specs it seems many manufacturers inflate the number of bodies and lenses that can be carried inside
perhaps theyre all using mm primes and entry level dslrs to arrive at those numbers
in this bag i fit a pro dslr without a lens attached a flash beneath it  wide angle lenses roughly mm a standard prime a nifty mm and a second flash
another note on these bags where do you put the filter hoods
i have mine resting on top of the dividers but none of the bags ive seen allows the type of filters that go with wide angle lenses
i digress the side pockets work great for stashing batteries stray cords and filters
its been put through the paces only a couple of times so continued use will give me more information about its reliability and resistance to the elementsi know this product doesnt have the best reviews but i think its greati bought the s camera on amazon and this bag works just fine with iti can get the camera my extra batteries and the wall adaptor all in the bag just fine   its a very sturdy bag to
i wouldnt recommend it for a professional though who has to carry around a lot of camera stuff
but for me it worked great and i recommend it product is of excellent built quality
it cannot house  lenses with dslr camera body in my opinion
i have canon sl body mm stm lens  filters  extra battery battery charger sd card cables  prime lens placed inside this bag and in my opinion this bag cannot have any more camera body or zoom lens
however it is a well built compact and durable product which is excellent for the price
shipping and packing was excellent
zips pockets and padding is remarkable
overall a very good product
only the product description is misleading otherwise deserves  stars
will recommend to those who dont want big bags or have less equipment dslr camera and lensthis bag is excellent quality
however the space is tight if you want to carry multiple lenses
the bag could take my ti with kit lens and there was still some space left for just one more lens
the bag wont carry  lenses as advertisedtook me a long time of reading reviews before i settled on purchasing this bag
too big too small what is right for me
it fits my ti mm kit and my mm zoom lens without much issue
the spare battery charger usb cable all fit in the front pocket
there isnt much room for anything else thoughyes it is a serious camera bag and yes it is small
but what i did not know until mine arrived was that it has a builtin waist belt inside a rear pouch that adds weight and bulk
it is not removeable altho the shoulder strap is
minus one starotherwise it is perfect for my canon g with my canon  ex speedlite mounted and ready to use
im going to keep ituseful and safe way to transport your geari would have bought one size bigger had i known how much gear i would accumulate to carrya well made and fairly priced bag nonethelesscan fit a camera body with lens attached and one extra lens for me  to   in side pouch can fit extra batterys and charger
probably still space for a couple other very small thingsthis bag works well with our canon eos rebel ti camera
we took it on long treks through petra and other parts of jordan among other places
its a bit bulky but i think thats going to be true for any camera bag cause the camera itself and a couple of lenses are a little bit bulky
i felt like it provided great protection for the camera and lenses thoughive been using this bag for several months now and it has worked really well for me
i have a canon ti and only have one lens and everything fits almost perfectly
i only wish they had a larger pouch at the top where i could put my external mic but other than that everything i use fits neatly in the bag
it seems to be of good quality and i think it will last for a long time to comeim giving this bag a  star but only because its almost too tight for acanon eos d  mp cmos digital slr camera with inch lcd body onlywith acanon ef mm f l is usm lens for canon eos slr camerasimage stabilized lens and thats without its lens shadeyou can get your d with mm f l is lens into this bag
remove the lhs velcro side cushion  remount it on the bottom rhs of the bag then position the camera in the bag oriented portrait mode side with shutter button oriented upoverall the bag is sturdy yet light and has enough compartments for the d charger  a few filtersthis bag is great
it has many compartments for batteries memory cards and whatnot
its well made and very sturdy
it also comes with different straps to use
the only reason i didnt give it  stars was because for one its a little bulky to carry around
and two every time i want to put my camera away for a little while i have to take it apart to put it in the bag
i know for some thats not that big of a problem but im running around taking pictures and then when i have a  minute break before the next team goes on i dont want my camera hanging around my neck
so i have to take my camera apart to put it away zip the bag up then hook it all in a crowded place
so for me it just gets a little redundant after a while
but for some this product may be perfectbig enough to fit the camera with extra lens with extra pocket for accessory  nicely design great value good materiali bought this for my lenses for my new canon rebel t
it holds the lenses and gadgets well
its fairly easy to carry
i got one just like it at walmart for the t
i paid more at walmart
i do have one small gripe the color
olive green is fine but it feels a little gi joe camo to me
i would have preferred all black or possibly sea blue on the bottomif you have a big lens like mm or bigger it will not fit when its fixed on camerai will get a bigger one for my extra lenses and othe gera like flash and ectbut its good for body and one small lens
good quality toonice bag carrys my camera with standard lens attached and my telephoto
pockets work for smaller items like filters and manuals
sturdy seems like it should last
easy to carry along with shoulder strap or handlei only recommend buying this if you have just one camera and one medium sized lens that you want to keep safe
i thought the case would be bigger but it is the perfect size when i take out the dividers
the only thing i can complain about is its sizewell made bag with all metal hooks
generous padings all aroundim a hobbiest photographer i dont have that much gear to go around with
the main compartment of the bag is an exact fit for my d with lens and lens cap on mm f l
front compartment fits lens back cap camera body cap x aa flash light
i managed to squeeze in a lens cleaning pen
the charger my mm f lens laptop and tripod goes in my backpack
for  bucks this bag is very well made just wish it were a little biggerthe back is light weight nicely padded throughout to protect your lens and camera
i like the pouch in the front portion of the back good space for the battery charger and cable
when you open the main compartment you will find a zippered pouch for small items such as your lightning bolt connector for your ipad to transfer pics from your media card along with other small items you may choose to carryit is easy to clean when it gets dusty from being out hiking
the dividers are nicely padded although somewhat frustrating to remove and move to change the compartment sizes
however not a reason at all to avoid this bagmy only reason for not giving this bag  stars is that the strap is a little short for a big person as myself
i wish the strap was longer to accommodate a better hang from my shoulder
the solution i found is to replace the strap that come with the bag with another strap i borrowed from my laptopoffice messenger baggreat price for an very nice bag
i would not hesitate to recommendeverything is ok
except for that fact that the handle stitching is a little slant
all in all its goodlike it because it is sturdy and well built but  stars because it gets pretty cramped in it with  eos rebel and  lenses
the camera would not fit in it with the  mm lens attached to iti just got my new camera a canon eos rebel ti and needed a bag
i didnt want a big bag and i know i will be getting a backpack later on 
so my goal was to find an inexpensive small bag for everyday use
this fits the bill
it has two modular inserts that can be removed  they attach with velcro  and the bag has the ability to be worn on the shoulder carried in hand or  which i totally missed when i got it  worn around the waistits very well made you can get this bag with confidence as long as you want something small  it fits my camera with the zoom lens and the battery charger maybe a filter or two but not much elsei love my case
it holds my mm zoom lens along with necessary pocket for extra battery and memory card and any cords that might be necessary
of course the dslr camera with my mm lens attached fits in as well
there is a long strap for carrying plus you can attach it to your waistband if you prefer
i wish it were slightly larger in the eventuality i might get a larger zoom lens
on the plus side it fits easily into my swiss army backpack when flying
these days travelers can only take one personal item to keep at their feet and one carryon for the overhead bin
if you are like me you dont ever want to check your ipad camera cell phone ipod gps and all accompnaying chargers in your checked baggage so its nice to know a camera bag like this will easily fit into that single carryon backpack or other tote bag
no worries about safety thenif you have more then one extra lens dont get this bag
it only fits the camera with attached lens and one extra lens which is nice if you only have one
but if you need to take a couple lenses with you id suggest something bigger like this backpack  httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbrtarefohdetailsosimy husband uses the bag for his camera
plenty of room lightweight durable and we took it to nyc yesterday when we took the circle line touri bought another bag for my canon dslr but it was too bulky so i was looking for something smaller
this looked appealing so i bought it
i looked at a ton of bags before this one
the interior size is a bit smaller than i thought and when taking out one insert fits the dslr with the  lens sideways and a bit snug and then fits a telephoto next to it but very tight
you wont be able to get anything else inside
however it does have a lot of pocket space and is compact enough and stylish to be carried all the time
i like the clasps on this as well very durable metal and the canvas is very thick and durable and nice colorswas nice bag except for the fact it is tight for a dslr camera large lens and extras ok for a smaller camera with no added lensand battery packs
no place for instruction bookits a canon product not much more to say about the quality
however my d with efs  lens on barely fits into it
i would have to take the lens off each time if both have to fit in comfortably
there is no room to store the flashlight unless i take the lens off
even then it might be a squeeze
in near future i may consider a larger bagi bought this gear bag based on reviews i read and most said this bag was huge so i was a bit surprised at how small it is
my fault for not double checking the dimensions
i guess if youre using a point and shoot then it is huge
a bit small for a dslr though
the tag claims it will hold  bodies and  lenses but i dont know how this is possible
it barely holds my eos xs with two zoom lenses and albinar  mdtz strobe in the main compartment
neither lens is really very big
im not sure how it would hold  bodies and  lenses but it does what i need it to do and thats really all that mattersthe build quality is superb and i expect this to last a long time
the strap clips and attachments are metal not plastic and the zippers are large and heavy duty
though they are made of nylon they appear very robust
the main compartment layout is adjustable with very nice padded detachable dividers and the gear is very well protected
the dividers fold over on the top for a layered effect which is how my strobe fits over the lenses and body
overall i am very satisfied with this bag
for the money it really cant be beat
just make sure you check the dimensions and match them to your gear and needsit was a great buy and at a great price i saw the exact one at walmart for 
so yea if your looking for a beginner bag this is the way to goi got this bag for my wife for christmas  when i got her a ti
this bag is well made and holds all kinds of stuff that i got her for the camera
my only complaint would be that the camera with a lens attached has a hard time storing an additional lens
it can be done but not with easethe above reviews sum it up well i have a d body mm lens mm lens macro filters and a remote for the camera
it fits just so and its definitely not a grab something out real quick or throw everything back in and run kind of bag
however other than that this thing is solid it is not made cheaply which is great
the zippers and latches are all metal not plastic
the pouch up front fits a spare battery and all my charging cablesi purchased this for my canon es and it fits perfectly
there is enough room for  extra batteries a charger memory cards cables and even a small tripod
this is bulky but it protects everything inside
very well paddedthis is a good bag its really good for the beginner camera guy i just got a rebel camera and so far i can fit the camera and  other lenses in  really kinda looks like its made just for the rebel slr cams nothing bigger i may be able to fit  more lenses depending on the size i dont have enough room for my cords like my adapters and things
i can kinda fit my charger inside i can fit my sd cards inside as well but its worth it  has a fanny pack strap as well as the shoulder strapi havent travelled with it yet but so far i really like it
the waist option versus the shoulder strap is neat
i didnt realize it had that until i was packing it up
of course id love something a little slimmer and more lightweight but that just isnt practical when youre looking for the convenience of a carryall with the reassurance of protecting your investmentif youre like me  youve just spent  on a nice slrdslr camera you want a nice protective bag for your kit but dont have a lot of spare  to spend on it
this bag is well designed seems well made and is low priced
it has storage space for your camera   lenses as well as some additional compartments that are perfect for spare batteries sd cards external flash filters and an external flash
i think its a great value for the money even if you end up getting several lenses down the road  need to replace it with a bigger bag
if you dont see yourself having more than whats already been mentioned then this bag will fit the bill for you longterm as welli bought this for a canon ti and it fits very well
it fit the canon ti with m lens attached plus an extra mm lens and some little things like extra battery and memory card
but thats all you can cram into it
if you think you need to put in some more then youll need a bigger bag
if not then this will do just finethe canon mrex macro ring lite is a great flash unit for use at fairly close range
as the model number indicates it has a guide number of  which means that its effective range is about  meters or  feet
this is only slightly more powerful than the builtin flashes in canons lowend dslrs which have a guide number of  and considerably weaker than canons other external flash units the effective range of which varies from model to model from  meters to  meters
but the low guide number is not really a problem for the intended use of the mrex which is closeup and macro photography
by mounting the macro ring lite on a lens the subject of a photograph is made to seem to be illuminated equally from all directions
this avoids the harsh shadows that are commonly seen in pictures when a single flash unit was pointed directly at the subjectthe mrex allows each of its two semicircular lamps to be adjusted individually allowing one side of the subject to be illuminated more strongly than the other if desired
it also provides two smaller lamps to aid autofocusing in dim conditions
it can even serve as a master controller for offcamera canon speedlite flash units
it is powered by four aa batteries rechargeable nimh batteries are recommendedthe mrex mounts easily on thecanon ef mm f compact macro lens thecanon ef mm f macro usm lensnow discontinued and thecanon mpe mm f x macro lens
to mount it on the newcanon ef mm fl is usm to macro lens acanon macrolite adapter is required
to mount it on thecanon ef mm fl macro usm lens a canon macrolite adapter c fml is needed
on some other lenses it can be mounted with reasonable stability simply by attaching an appropriate mm stepup ring to the lens
i have done this with atokina atx mm f pro d macro lensusing akenko mm stepup ring to mm
other lenses will probably require different rings to step up from their native filter size to mmcanon also offers the somewhat more expensivecanon mtex macro twin lite flash which also mounts two lamps on the lens but instead of a ring the mtex provides two small lamps that can be positioned independently
i have not used it but it seems to be well regardedi bought the canon mrex macro ring lite to go along with mycanon ef mm f macro usm lensto be used on acanon eos d  mp cmos digital slr
i really havent explored extreme macro photography before so i thought i might as well see if it is something i could love
so as i do with most things i get interested in i went a little nuts and bought a ton of equipment including the canon mrex macro ring lite
note i am an amateur photo enthusiast so my perspective is offered from the pointofview of an  enthusiasts who just loves to go out there and capture as many nifty exposures as i can for fun not necessarily a perspective for the prosobservations even though the fstop for the canon mm macro lens is a  you still need a ton of lighting to get good shots without cranking up the iso or slowing down the shutter speed to something that will invariably lead to a blurry picture even when using a tripod
this macro ring lite offers a fairly reliable solution to the problem
you could also invest in thecanon ef mm fl is usm macro lenssince the lseries comes with image stabilization and is very well reviewed but there are many situations where i could see needing the macro ring even with the lseries w is
that and the lseries lens is almost 
but that upgrade will probably come in due time
until then i will continue to use the canon mm f usm macro lens which is also very well ratedon to the canon mrex macro ring liteprosnicely built with a heavy feel to the unit especially the cordaa batteries make it easy to powercommunicates with the cameras ettlthe guide leds are a very helpful for quick focustakes nice pics without too much washout like other flashes can causevery useful for inanimate object closeupshelpful with living subjects that arent afraid of the flashs guide lights or noisesmakes your camera look kickassconsadds quite a bit of overall weight when loaded with batteriesi would have liked it to also work with canon batteriesit is on the higher end of the price spectrumreally doesnt work well on human subjects from my own experience you make have different resultsnot perfect when trying to get spontaneous shots since there is so much fiddling with the flash settingsguide leds and noise seems to startle the more jittery of my small subjects like anoles  skinks spiders and winged creaturesthe exposure color tends to be too white k and the lite doesnt come with filters for color offsetting but i am a dirty cheater who loves photoshop and uses it shamelessly i solve many of the filtering issues in postbut after using the flash for a week or so it has its unquestionable benefits and works perfectly in most of the situations i have used it in
but there are a few drawbacks that hold the canon mrex macro ring lite form being a perfect addition to the macro photographers arsenal
i would still highly recommend the canon mrex macro ring lite for the more serious enthusiast who wont mind spending a little time with it to learn its strengths and secretsgreat product but against as stated in product description it wont fit directly to new canon mm  l macro lens and adapter from  to mm is requiredi received both canon mm  l and this lens just to see that spend us more is require and worst need another week to start using those productsi bought my g in december borrowed a canon  ex speedlite and liked the results but i wondered if the smaller lighter less expensive  ex would be good enough
some of the reviews here say it is underpowered
is it
i bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in  pm darkness to try them at  feet  feet  feet and  feet on the gconclusion   the g has a good builtin flash
it makes good images within its limited range of  meters feet or  meters feet when the lens is set to telephoto and works well as a fill flash
complete failure beyond  feetconclusion   the ex range  meters and the ex range  meters feet both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range
but both are limited by the autofocus range of  to  meters
thats right neither flash can focus on a subject more than  feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto
both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at  feetfinal conclusion  im keeping the  ex
the g is small and light so is the ex
they make a good team but the g also does well alone up closeunless you can convince yourself that you need the features of higher models such as the ex this is a great flash
it is very simple  turn it on take the picture turn it offit seems to be a little less harsh than the popup flash on my rebel xt
it also claims to be a little more powerful than the popup flash
finally i have lens hoods on a few of my lenses
thus the popup flash often creates a shadow
this flash takes care of that problemif you fall somewhere between being a clueless photographer who has no idea what this flash might do for you but are short of an overeager hobbyist who might want to fiddle around with more advanced features then this is a good flashit does not swivel or tilt but i dont care about that
i mainly wanted a little more power than my popupbuiltin flash and i wanted to get above my lens hoods to prevent shadowing
this flash works for mei give it  stars bc there seems to be a notable reduction in light output if you take rapid fire shotsdoes everything it was meant to do
only reason for the  is the relatively steep pricemy only gripe is this i bought this remote to take pictures without having to touch the shutter button to avoid camera shakethe remote only works if it is pointed at the sensor in the front of the camera
you could be less than an inch from the sensor but if it is not facing the front of the camera it wont take
i know i could have bought one of the corded remotes but i like to use the remote for taking family pics tooi dont have to run to get in place every timeits not a big deal it still works greatgrabbing one of these for myself since i found my camera on the list at the canon site

clips to the canon camera strap so theres less chance of losing it
i purchased this remote at the same time that i purchased my xtid
i was familiar with this rc remote from previous use with my rebel xtdthe rc remote has the same problem with the xti of not being able to trigger the shutter from behind the camera
im not sure why the eye proximity sensor next to the xti viewfinder isnt used for the remote ir also
i use the remote mainly just to ensure that im not in contact with the cameratripod during the shutter releaseoverall this is still a very great item
for night shots i secure my camera on the tripod set up a decent shot through the viewfinder and then stand to the side and use the remote for three or four shots holding the remote near the front of the camerai had the very same remote but it was sold earlier along with my rebel
i was very happy with it at that time
it was simple it worked and it was relatively inexpensive
just bought it for my the d mark ii and it works well and meets my needs
someone must have good reasons to pay more for a wired one but i certainly dont at this point of timethe canon rc is a great remote if you are aligned directly in front of the sensor
or maybe the battery is weak
the nice thing is that i can store the rc directly on the shoulder strap of my rebel xtigreat for use instead of the self timer as well as for handsoff operation for tripod setups
this model has instant shot and second delay modes both of which i have found usefulvery nice little gadget that makes taking photos so much easier while the camera is on the tripod
i do wish it was easier to see the onoff switch the switch is black and written with black lettering on a black remote and would be nice if the shutter release button was better situated but overall this is a very convenient handy little remote for the xsitook several rereads of the instructions to get this to work with my camera
its been working well ever since
great products with below average instructions
btw  im an engineer who reads manuals and instructions and usually get things right the first time
reading instructions is time well spenti have used this for many pictures especially images where i either wanted to be in the picture or images where the natural shake of my hand would have caused blur
my only complaint about this is that the distance from which you can take a picture isnt very far maybe  feet
 and you always have to have the remote right in front of the camera and aimed right at the lens which causes you to look unnatural in some photos
overall a good productgood remote
can be finnicky at times if not lined up correctly with the camerai havent had a lot of oppurtunity to really play with it yet but i do like it a lot better than the corded one that i have for my film canon rebel
with the cord being about  feet long its not very ideal for some things
but with this wireless remote thats no problem
also you can set it with a delay so that you can take shots of yourself and not look like an idiot holding on the the remote i decided to get this after buying the rebel xti and already owning the rebel xt this works with both
i already had the corded shutter release which was nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even a little camera shake can make a huge difference
but this goes to a new level you can set the camera up get everything in focus and then step back and take as many shots as you want without any risk of touching the camera
make sure to cover the eyepiece when using this so stray light doesnt ruin your exposure
this is also handy when you want to take pictures with you in them
i have even used it with two cameras at once to get multiple angles of the same shot
i am thinking about setting up a blind and setting up the camera on a tripod to try to get some close up pictures of wildlife that would not be possible otherwise
basically if you ever have a need to take pictures without holding the camera this is your solutionthis control is pretty cool it works great but you have to be pretty close to your camerabut it only seems to work if you are pretty much deadon square to the camera
i was hoping for wider area coveragethis is not usable with the eos d cameragreat range and ease of use
set the camera to remote point and click the button on the remote
focus and photo are taken and you have a lasting image
my only reason for not being a  is the price but its canon what should i expecti purchased the rc remote to use with my canon d xti
this is a nofrills easy to use wireless remote that is small and very light
it can even attach to your camera strap so its on hand wherever you are
there are  shutter settings you can choose no delay and  second delay and the remote will easily work up to a  foot distancemy only gripe is like alot of others have mentioned is that the remote doesnt work from the rear of the camera which would be handy when doing portrait shots and trying to prevent camera shake
if not for this i would have no hesitation to give it  starsit works great but i am hardly in front of the camera
i always have to reach over the camerai like using this remote with my canon xti but i always have to remember to switch the camera to timer mode and the lense to manual focus
i still think it is more convenient to use the wired remote because i have a preference to be behind the camera instead of dangling the wireless remote in front of or over the camera
however the wireless remote is convenient because it is wireless and it is faster to access for those quick shots if you are constantly on the move without spending the additional time to unwrap the wired remote
i especially enjoy using the wireless remote for group shots with myself included instead of the cameras automated timer
overall i use both the canon wireless rc and the canon wired e remotes
for some it might not be necessary to have both but i like having the option to use either
it just depends on what the specific situation calls fori like this remote a lot  nice to be able to be in the pictures without having to use the second delay
my only issue is that the remote must be in the line of sight with the cameras sensor
it would be nice to be able to trigger a shot from the side of the camera in certain situationsworks great for what it is
i was looking for a wireless remote to use from behind my camera not in front of it
my badsince i do scenic photography not portrait and i dont photograph myself in them i dont need to be in front of the cameraworks great for our rebel ti
as i had read you do need to be in front of the camera and have line of sight
i love the  second delay in order to hide the remote in family shots
easily clips to camera strapi had to buy about  of these when i started using them
they are small efficient but do not last forever
but at the price point i can afford to buy a couple of replacements once in a while
recommend for those interested in self portraits or prefer to shoot with controlsa cordless remote switch is useful to have if you want to be in some of your shots in or outdoors
if you are setting up a portrait studio and using yourself as a trial model it is invaluable as setting the camera timer becomes a choreworks great indoors
outdoors worked well most of the time
im very satisfied
certainly better the regular auto timerworks just as advertised with my xti
however some people commented about using it behind the camera unfortunately i could never get it to work that wayi like this wireless remote
now i dont have to rush to my spot in  secondsworks as advertised with my xsi d
it was a lot smaller than i expected about the length and width of my thumb
its so light weight id say that its about the same as a ballpoint pen
it comes with a holderbase that can be threaded onto a  inch strap so you dont lose the small item
the clip that secures the remote to the base feels flimsy due to the light weight but there are not any gaps which may snag an errant object
in agreement with the other reviews the toggle between offinstantdelay is very small and definitely not accessible to fat fingers or gloves
one other thing youll need to stand to the right of the frame to point the remote at the ir receiver
standing on the left sometimes the lens will block the line of sight
similarly if youre tilting the camera on a tripod sometimes the ir receiver wont be in your line of sight
however compared to the cost of an wireless setup which cost about  dollars more this device is cost effective despite the deficiencies mentionedmy decision came down to this product versus the opteka rc
the difference was only  dollars so i splurged
however only  stars because the thing feels so flimsy and the aforementioned limitationsi bought this to take pictures of my infant and for macro picts
it allows me to be away from the camera to trigger the shutter
it does what it claims and does it wellits a very usefull divice but it dont have a focus function and only two shoot settings direct shoot and  seconds delaymy only gripe is that this remote is lowpowered ir  it has to have a fairly clear line of sight to the cameras sensor  ie
remote triggering from behind the camera sometimes doesnt work  ive even had a very large lens block the signalother than that it works as designed  no complaintsi like the two modes  instant and delayed triggeringno surprises it does exactly what it is supposed to do
a bit expensive i guess one pays for the canon brand
i used to have the opteka equivalent and found it less reliablei really like the following points solid build nice design the fact that it can be attached to the strap the delay and immediate modei use it mostly for outdoor landscape photography and indoor studio portrait and no complaints
the only drawback is the fact that one needs to face the camera ok from angle but reduces the distance and definitely unusable from behind the camera it is ir activated not radiothis item is a good addon to my canon dslr
it is compact simple and works well
the only problem is this remote control seems not very sensitive
you have to point it straight to your camera accurately or it wont workonce i figured out that i had to hold the remote off to the side and to the left of the camera facing me in order to get it to work it worked fine
might have been nice if the instructions included that little tidbit of helpful info since i thought the thing was broken when i tried to use it with my right hand and it only worked one out of  timesive had this remote now for about  weeks and have used it several times for a beginning photography class i am taking and our first assignment was taking selfportraits
if you are taking selfportraits or group photos with you in them in a welllit scene then this remote is perfect
i have found that you do need to point the remote pretty much directly at the sensor on your camera so that will be just to the left of the lens as you face your camera
it does not seem to register the click from any other angle
and as i stated there must be good lighting to use it
i tried a few shots in a candlelit setting and the remote did not work
the camera sensor doesnt seem to be able to pick it up in darkened situations
so if you want something for more than selfportraits in any lighting condition and at any angle from farther than  ft then you should get a remote that uses radio frequencies but i think those cost upwards of 
and one more note this remote comes with a plastic cover that you will want to keep on it when not in use because it prevents the button from being accidentally pressed if you have it stored tightly in with all of your other equipment
my friend learned this the hard way when he pulled it out to use it and the batteries were dead because some of his other equipment happened to be pressing against the button when he had it in his packworks great with my rebel xt
being able to shoot remotely lets me take pictures of myself nekked with great ease
highfivethere are  remotes for the canon rebel xtia wired remote and two wireless remotesthis is the one that can take instant pictures and be programmed with a  second delayit works exactly as expected
it clips on your neck strap securelybe warned the infrared receiver is on the front of the xti so both wireless remotes will only work from the frontwish i bought this sooner
this is wonderful for taking photographs of yourself on trips
i had my camera for a long while and have only rarly taken pictures of myself on my trips
i end up coming back with pictures of my wife the scenerybut rarely myself
this remote changed it
the reason i dont give it  stars is that you need to be relatively close to the camera
wish it worked from a greater distance
also it would have been nicer if it was radiocontrolled rather than infrared
in order for it to work i have to stand on one side in direct line of sight of the sensor
not a big deal but you have to take this into account when positioning yourself in a groupthis little remote is a good product and a must for self and selffamily protraiture
i found the shutter release options very handy
very small and easy to carry around in your shirt pocket if you wanted to
the caveats and hence why four stars you must be in front of the camera or at least the remote
the small size though practical in some respects it also presents a problem since its fairly easy to misplace
trust me when you carry around k worth of equiment or when youre doing paid work the least your mind is thinking about is this little remote
thugh for the price its ok to lose it i suppose
but in conclusion i think this is nice product at a fair pricethe device came quickly and works as advertised
limited to about  feet
works on d and d
drawback receiving sensor is on front only
plus cheapi have the rebel xsi
purchased this remote to do family shots
it works great
i had an different after market remote that i lost and im glad i did
range is respectable on this model
do keep in mind that if using for tripod shots with slow shutter speed you need to be able to place the remote in front of the camera for it to worki have been using this remote for well over a year
it is a low priced but good ir remote for compatible canon camerasi dont use this frequently but is nice when i do need it
i like that i dont have to pay anyone else to take our pictures when i can pose and do it all myselfi love this remote control for simple remote shooting
it works only in front or side of camera thoughits light weight and easily hidden in palm but also easy to losemine broke after one week because i dropped it no warranty or repairs from canon so consider this a disposable remote control which is why i think its too expensive for i had to get another one but shop around to get it lt i didnt think id want this on my camera strap but it fit so well and is so unobtrusive that i left it on once id tried it
having it right there makes it incredibly convenientgood for tripod work though you have to reach around the front of the xti because thats where the sensor is
the second delay mode is great for long exposures as it locks the lens up and eliminates that shakei wish the buttons were a little bigger to permit use with gloves
i also wish the instructions were a little easier to read
its one sheet with  different languages in tiny print and are a little vague in spotsi liked it so much i bought two
actually i lost the first one and then found it the same day my new one came in
now i have a backupmy only complaint is that the holder is meant for use with a thin stock shoulder strap
i put on a much more comfortable and thicker aftermarket strap and the holder wont fituntil looking at the pictures in this review i didnt realize that the holder can also be used to stabilize the lens prevent camera from tipping forward when the camera is set on a flat surface
nice touch
unfortunately i usually have the vertical grip installed which obviously makes the camera too tall for this feature
i guess i have another complaint but its not exactly about this product its about canons placement of the product canon does not support this infrared remote on their higher end digital cameras
they probably do this to avoid canibalizing sales of their much more expensive hundreds of dollars but also much longer range lc which doesnt work on the rebel
they do the same thing with their wired remotes so if you upgrade you can use your lenses and flashes but you have to upgrade your wired and wireless remotes
not a good pr movethis is a backup to activate remote video for my canon dslr
it took a bit of tricky testing to figure out to take a picture to focus then activate video but this works fine for the pricepros  it is an inexpensive solution to control camera in a distance
its more convenience to make self shot than to use cameras  second time release
since it is so small i carry with camera all the time
i have used it for four years it still works as a new onecons working distance is very limit in normal condition you could get about  ft working range
under strong sunlight you may not be able to control camera above  ft you have to point it accurately toward camera sensor and you have to be in the position that camera sensor can see you
other wise it does not work
therefore it will not work if your are on the left side or behind camera since sensors are on the front and on the right side of the camera canon rebel
serious user should use radio frequency based remote control instead of this oneworks only when pointed directly at the front of the camera
otherwisea great product
a must if you do not have a is lens and want to shoot at higher focal lengthsproduct came on time and intact
easy to set up and very compact
attaches directly to shoulder strap for easy carrying
used for the holiday season in  and found that it needs a direct line of sight to the xsi for signal to be received
tried from different angles and distances and found this to be true
often times you simply need to be next to the optical reader on the camera to activate the shutter release
for group portraits with family and friends you may need to hide remote discretely and in line with the camera for line of signal site and to release shutter
outdoor and indoor single portrait shots are simpler since i simply mount xsi on the tripod and focus on subject
i can stand by the camera and activate remote to get a steady no vibration shot
it works great for those kind of shots
i recommend this product for groupindividual portraits but beware of signal receiving issuesi think is better have two ways for take the pictures without touch the camera but is a good deal any waydoes what its supposed to
i wish it was wireless but that option is not available for my model camera unfortunatelyi read the reviews for this device and noted that the main shortcomming was the fact that the cable was too short
i picked up a foot extension on line for  and paid more to ship it than the cable itself
i have used it several times and it is really a great device
highly recommend itdan orr marylandthis is a simple electronic cable release i bought to use with the canon d and it works perfectly with it
gave it  starts instead of  because it is very easy for the slider lock to become engaged
i disabled it by simply taping it so the slider switch cannot movethis is a very simple remote control
it provides just the bare minimum capability that one would want in a remote control
used with my rebel xti it supports the  depressed autofocus and exposure and the fully depressed shutter releaseit also has a nice simple slide plate that will lock the button in the fully depressed position to hold the shutter open for the long duration exposuresthe product is made entirely of plastic which feels a bit flimsy but is surprisingly rugged in my experience and has an oval cross section which takes a little getting used to
being made of plastic this product is very lightweight which is a plus in my opinionmy only complaint echoed by several other reviewers is that the connecting cable is very short
in fact in my estimation it is even too short for when you actually want to be close to the camera which is the case for me doing a fair amount of closeup macrophotography
it is so short that i have a hard time making sure i dont bump the camerabut the good news is that as at leat one other reviewer noted you can easily get an extension from any electrical supply house or from radio shack
the plug is an  stereo plug and if you get your extension from radio shack youll need to gat a couple of to stereo adapters and use the  stereo extension cords the one i got is  feet long
total cost was about  so its no big expensemy only complaint with my solution is that the adapters stick out quite a bit from the body of the camera and they can cause torque on the camera if youre not careful to ensure that there isnt any tension pulling on the adapteri am most happy with this product
for me it is a much better solution than the wireless solutions which  require you to be almost directly in front of the camear and  which in my experience tend to frequently but inadvertantly get the infrared signal showing up in the photographit is a shame that canon doesnt make the cable on the product about another foot to two feet longer
i think that show poor engineering judgement on canons partbut the problem is easily enough remidied so i wouldnt hesitate to recommend this product to anyone looknig for an inexpensive simple and flexible solution to remote triggering of their canon camerasthe canon remote switch r e works great
the cord is a bit shorti think its maybe  ft i would have liked to see it come with a  cordi really like making photographs in low light but i dont care for coarse grain or the bugs artifacts created by using high iso settings above iso  with digital cameras
this is my one issue with my old panasonic lumix fz
i had always used a cable release with film cameras and finding an electric one for my lumix and a subsequent olympus e i decided this was a musthave for my camera bagi found the canon remote on amazon to be about the best price
receiving the remote i found it worked great but i felt the foot cable was a little short
its generally not too inconvenient and it does what i expect it to do but another foot or so would be welcome hey canon why not a full meter
i found a foot conductor stereo extension at the local cables and connectors store and now i can get as far back as i need to
now if only i could rig a decent remote monitorin short  i love the product but i would love it more if the cable was a little longerperfesseri have been using it for almost a month now and its been a great help to me when taking night photos
i only wish it can do moreits compatible with canon eos rebel xtixsixs and the latest rebel ti also compatible with eos rebel g eos elan ii eos elan iie and eos ix
great price
thanks to amazon and adorama
if youll ask if i will recommend this yes i will recommend thisyou can see some of the photos ive taken at this works so much better than the cheap unit i bought
i should have got this the first time well made and works great the only issue is the cord is to short needs to be  feet longer
one star off for thati bought this cable release to use with my nikon d and thecustom idea geopic ii  direct connect geotagging gps unit for nikon  fujifilm digital slrs
the geo tracker plugs directly into the  pin connector of the nikon  which blocks using the normal nikon cable release
however the geopic has a connection to add the canon or compatible cable release
the combo works great togetherbillwell made and works just fine i have a cannon eos d and it works well
 stars but the cord is way to short
you need to be sitting right next to camera for use
better than remote for bulb shotshave a night shot without a flash problem and cant hand hold the camera tripod it and use this cable releasethis is just the electronic version of thata must have for night shots
this is a canon product and is designed to work with all modern canon cameras
i own a ti and it works just fine
great asset to have for night shots where the lens has to stay open for long periods and cannot be jostledi purchased this to use with my canon powershot sx hs so i could remotely trigger the shutter on long zoom shots while having the camera mounted on a tripod
i wanted this in order to prevent any camera shake and the resulting blurry image without having to resort to using a timer on the camera itself
the remote does exactly what you would expect it triggers the shutter on the camera and since it doesnt require batteries is always ready to be put to work without any fuss
it works really well and overall am very happy i purchased itthe cable is very short which isnt much of an issue when youre standing right at the camera but if you want to move away from the camera at all then the short cable becomes more of a liability
this is easily and cheaply remedied by purchasing a mm headphone extension cable
i went with theyour cable store  foot mm stereo headphone extension cableavailable here on amazon for under  at the time of this writing which now gives me a combined cable length of  feet
that said the short length of the cable is the primary reason for me knocking off a star
other than the short cable this is a good quality remote shutter switch for supported canon cameras including the powershot sx hs and i have no problem recommending it to anyone who has a supported camera though i would recommend picking up an extension cable at the same time just to make your life easierthis is a good value works well for both timelapse photography and low light conditions
ive read about the battery running low because it does not have an off switch but when im finished with it i just turn the battery upside down and it shuts off
works wellhave been meaning to pick one of these up for ages now
its really small so i will likely buy a clip or something to attach it to my camera strap while in use so i dont use it
the only downside i can see straight away is the very short cordlooking forward to trying it out
great packagingyou seriously cant beat the price on this
its a bit bulky but im not sure if the canon model is the same in the way of bulkiness
it works great and the price is awesomecanon remote switch rs ethis is a greatb tool for the macro shooter or slow shutter speeds
very usefull also when you need to lock the mirror up for less noisethe only draw back is the short cord
would be much better if it were longer maybe  or more for different applicationsthis thing is mainly useful for bulb exposures you have to manually lock the shutter and unlock it when you have completed the exposure time it doesnt count the time since it doesnt have any procesors or logical electronics inside
another thing it may work great is to be taking pictures with the camera mounted on a tripod when you dont want to move it even by the shutter button being pushedit works just great for those two things
the remote has a shape to make easy to roll the cable around it in the bottom has a little hole to connect the cable so that it can be stored without the cable going everywhere its kinda clever
i would recommend this product if this is what you want it for and if you dont want to spend mucha corded remote switch is a must have for any tripod photography
cable could be a  couple of feet longeri bought this to use with an eos rebel xsi and it does exactly what it should do
ive always successfully used it to take some really nice astronomy and wildlife shots
its a must for tripod and telephoto shots
the switch attaches quickly and is easy to usethis is a necessary accessory and is always in the bag and goes with me whenever i travel with the camera and tripodi purchased this for use with my old canon rebel xti
it works great and i love the shutter lock function for long exposuresa must have for anyone doing long exposure photography
i use it for taking photos of  the night sky with my tieasy to use and well built the only con  its a little small for my hand not a big deal though very happy with this productshooting macro and long exposures with your canon aps camera is much easier with this remote
but while it is more pleasant to use than the  second timer it is an extra part to carry so sometimes i forget or dont bother using it
also an infrared remote is more versatile since it lets you take shots of yourself as wellthis switch is essential if you wish to shoot bulbive found that the switchtrigger is quite sensitive and it likes to get in the lock position quite easily
other than that this is a quality canon productpros  its a remote shutter releasecons  short cord gets tangled  twisted up easilyi am no longer able to hold a camera steady with out my tripod
i now use and carry my old gitzo tripod everywhere this canon remote switch is now in use everydaya good product works well in the canon very useful for pictures of precision
it would be better if he had the longer cableif you plan on taking any photos requiring longer exposure times particularly bulbmode photographs in which the shutter remains open until you close it you need this accessory for your camerathough the cord is shorter than would be desired a quick trip to any electronics store should provide a simple solution in an extension a  stereo extension cord or a  cord with adapters to 
as these can be had for well under  you can easily extend the reach of the shutter release beyond what canon providedoverall its a pretty cool little product
i bought the corded remote shutter release because i find the wireless one dont work as well
great purchasei was buying this as a button to help me to startstop video recording
it doesnt work for that it helps on the focusing d over here when pressed halfway but all the way down it takes a picture and it doesnt record
as no one posted something about video recording i suppose that i would give it a shot but no it doesnt work for that if anyone was planning using it for that purposethis is the best invention since swiss cheese
works great for a hands free photo
i would recommend this for any photogragherthe remote is working fine on my canon sx and i know some folks need a long cord to the camera but for my use its always in the way or tangled in the tripod or camera strap larryusing photoshop and being a big fan of bulb exposures the rs e is a must have accesory
you can use it just as you would the shutter button on the digital rebel as well as lock the shutter open which is very good for painting with a small flashlight etcmy only qualm with the switch is the shortness of the cord but if youre trying to take a self portrait with the remote then you need to get the infrared remote
the two of those combined makes for a perfect pair of tools for any remote picture taking needsworks with my canon digital rebel xt but the cable is really too short to be useful
had to buy extension cablegreat little gadget for keeping the camera super steady and tripping it remotely
like the other reviews say the cord is a little short but other than that it works greatthe remote switch works as it should and gives you enough cord length to avoid moving the camera when you wish to use itthe canon remote switch works as advertised
it would be nice to have a longer cable
works on my dthis little gadget has several usesit works on canon rebel and g series compacts like g  you can get steadier tripod pictures when you dont touch the camera when firingalso if you cant see over a wall or a crowd you can stick the camera over the wall on a tripod or mono pod
then take the picture with the cable
this works best with a tilt screen camera like the latest rebel g or g
or if you are narcissistic you can take pictures of yourselfyou can also lock the shutter open and take long time exposures such as night photography
obviously this device works hand in hand with a tripodthe more i use my powershot g on tripods or try to do long exposures the more i realize that when my finger presses down on the shutter it slightly vibrates the camera and i get a slightly blurry exposure
well after untold numbers of photos and me scratching my head like an idiot i decided to get a remote switchthe remote switch works fine as advertised for the powershot g and works on the rebel series digital slrs as well xt xti etc
and this being a canon accessory youd better believe you pay more than you should for the canon brand
the cord isnt that long but can easily be extended with a trip to radio shack and for  google rse extensionnothing wrong with the switch and functions but for my purposes i needed one longer to get away from the wildlife
i knew it was short when i bought it so it met my expectations and i already knew how to extend it with adapters and an additional extension cord so im happy with it
now i can hide ten feet away and snap pictures of birds etc without leaving my blind or spooking the wildlife by setting up too closedefinitely a musthave accessory if you are doing long exposure or macro photographs
im using mine with an eos rebel xti and it works exactly like i expecteda half press sets focusexposure and a full press releases the shutter
identical to the shutter button on the camera
to hold the shutter open you can continue holding the remote button down with your thumb or you can slide the lock upwards and it will hold the button down for you
slide the lock down and it will release the button
ideal for use when the shutter is in bulb modefor the price paid it seems a little bit flimsy and fragile
i wouldnt expect it to hold up under heavy duty use but for my purposes i expect it to last quite a while
the halfpressfullpress of the button is hard to feel
unlike with the cameras button you dont get a lot of feedback on when to stop pressing for a halfpress
not a huge deal  the worst thing that would happen on a digital is a few extra shots on your memory cardif you need an external shutter release for your photography dont hesitate on buying this canon model
if you see it for less than  buy twoi needed a remote switch to control my ti and this one has what i needed  the bulb to hold the shutter open and shutter button is nice to use when taking those shots you dont want any vibrationso far it works
if it still does in a few years ill be happy and i would recoomend itthis switch is just what i needed for long exposures and low light photographs using a tripod
i like he fact that you can stand  behind the camera and take the photograph
this easy and simple to useworks very well
however we wish the cord was longer so we could be farther away from the camera
also not being able to hold the shutter open with the switch is disappointingif you take night picture or close up then mount the cannon camera on a tripod and attach this remote in the slot provided and you would get nice pictures without any shaking or blurrafter attending a local photography workshop it was recommended to purchase a remote camera trigger
i was tempted to get the wireless trigger but decided on this as the price was better
i also didnt see the point in a wireless remote
unless im in the scene there is no reason to be worried about cables since if im using this remote im using it while my camera is on a tripod and im not in the shot
this will allow you to get slightly sharper pictures by helping prevent camera shakethese are great for tripod use and slow shutter speeds to prevent movement
since it is a canon product you know what you are gettingit works as advertised
i use it for macro work
while it reduces camera jitter well its not an electronic remote
it is a good buy for the moneythe switch is easy to install on and remove from the camera
it functions well
it is well designed the shape makes it easy to hold
the trigger button works smoothly
i especially like that its designed for the cable to be wound around the body of the switch and cable stores into the notches to keep it wound
theres also a storage location for the plug
good designeasy to use
useful for tripod shooting and long exposures
it is good paired with a wireless remotecable could be longertrying to take macro photos using the button on the camera is damm hard
that is why canon makes the remote switchthis makes it so much easieri have a sxhs canon camera
with its powerful zoom x optical and x digital it gives you an excellent way to take pictures of distant objects
however in some cases you will need more stabilization that the camera offers with its internal automatic features
in this case you need this devicepros small size simple operationcons cord is shorter than would be desiredi recommend itreplaces the old cable release of yesteryear
i only gave it  stars becauseit is rather expensive to me for such a simple item
but it works greatand you need one for any exposures done from a tripod  especially forportraturethis is as short as it can bethumbs up turn onoff in  sec very good turn on lcd in  sec turn off in a split second x zoom is not bad at all  sec from w to t and vice versaequal to mm tv out is really convenient for presentation
i used this wheni took almost  pics after a farewell party and everybody justloved it tons of options to enhance your pics add a border exposureadjustment white balance internal memory that allows me to take  rapid shots
betterthan nothing battery is ok not great though
i took around  pics withlcd  connect to tv for presentation and the battery stillalive in a very critical condition with full battery you can turn on lcd for a little more than minsthumbs down zoom is a little noisy lcd is more pixelate and has a slow refresh rate around fps software is really bad
doesnt work with my comp celeronghz wk ram
i used a cf readersummaryi dont have to read the manual to use it
get an nimh battery and you are set to go
very good if you can get it around this is a great camera for the beginner someone new to digital cameras or an average user of cameras in general
even for a mp camera it takes great shots
granted i have nothing to compare it to
uploading photos is easy on winxp but i couldnt do it on win i had to buy a flash card readerpros affordable now anyway
 easy user interface with a mb flashcard you can take  high quality photos
x optical zoom is nicecons heavy
image viewer is kinda hard to see images are fuzzy
x digital zoom is useless
sucks batteries like crazy
get rechargablesi bought this camera  months ago and am pretty satisfied with it
the pictures it takes is of very high quality and it compresses it to jpeg by default
there is also a million options you can tinker with the get the picture you want
do yourself a favor and pick yourself up a  meg compact flash card nimh rechargable batteries and charger plus a kodak lens cleaning pen
you will definitely need all of it
my only gripe about this camera is that it is kinda heavy and also the lens cap keeps on falling offabove average camera
overall a good starter digital camera
the pictures are great with color reproduction being its greatest strength
in addition as many reviewers attest to this camera is easy to setup and use right out of the box
no problems with the software installation although i quickly uninstalled the included arcsoft photoimpression
quirky interface and useability issues
the lcd is more than adequate and unlike some reviewers i actually had no issues with battery life
i got  pics from the included alkalines and have been using rechargeables since then with well over  pics before recharge
pretty much what i expected from a digital camera
the menu system is easy to navigate but some settings that i use more often such as resolution and compression should have quick buttons on the camera to make switching back and forth easiermy biggest complaint is with the zoom
i knew what i was getting with the x zoom and it has been a limitation at times
wish it was a true x or greater mechanical zoom
in addition the zoom settings are not variable like a true slr
also as i get more used to the camera i wish i had greater control over more manual settingsthus my overall conclusion is that this is a good quotstarterquot digital camera although one could argue that  is a little pricey for your first digitial camera
what makes the price more justifiable to me was the quality of the highest resolution pictures
they are great leaving only some camera features as limitationspros great color reproduction
high resolution pictures are excellent
easy to setup and use out of the boxcons limited mechanical zoom x
limited manual adjustmentsthe  is a very solid  megapixel camera but so too is the  sowhy spend at least  more on the 
in terms of features itoffers almost nothing to recommend it
the fact is a camera in thisquality range should not cost this much
if you want an allaround meg digital check out the  if you want a more limited but stillvery functional digital camera for mostly internet apps look at the  the price
if you want mm quality controls and feellook at the  twice the pricei am having a lot of fun with this camera
takes great pictures and i actually think the software supplied is pretty good for sorting and downloading the photos onto the computerfor actually tinkering with the photos i use both adope photo deluxe and corel photopaint
couple of bugs with my unit explain the four stars i cannot select all five resolutionstwo intermediate settings are displayed but the camera wont select them
  the battery life indicator doesnt seem to workits displayed but the lithium batteries died without warning after lots of use
the movie feature is a fun gimmick
so is the ability to plug directly into a tv
to view the photos as a slide show
the camera is small which makes it easy to take along
fits in a jacket pocket
i like the lens cover and the unit seems sturdy
i am looking forward to getting the usb reader in the mail
downloads with the serial port take too long
i bought this as my first digital camera
i wanted the zoom and i wanted a convenient size and  megapixels
there were a few models that met these criteria and the zoom on this olympus as well as the video feature sold me on this one
i am hoping that the two minor bugs described above are easily resolvedi bought the d in december  and am very impressed with the camera so far
im always amazed at the clearity and sharpness of the photos i take
when i print them out they look like regular mm photos as long as i dont blow them up too big
this is my first digital camera and i love being able to email photos so easily to friends and family
they have told me how remarkably clear the photos i send them are
in fact one friend was so impressed he bought a d too
batteries last a long time in this camera which is nice some cameras can really eat up the batteries but this one suprises me
i must take like a hundred photos in between battery changes
the only down side to this camera is that sometimes the photos are a little dark but this is easily remedied with some photo enhancing software
i may be able to change the exposure setting on the camera to lighten it up a bit but havent played with that yet
the downloading hardware that comes with the camera is way to slow so just go buy a usb reader and youll be setunlike practically every pointandshoot digital out today this has a viewfinder
when taking photos outside in sunlight an lcd is essentially useless
also with the d i can turn off the lcd and conserve batteries
the d uses ordinary batteries that you can buy at any  the case closing to protect the lens in nice
the photos seem very sharp to me even though this is only a  megapixel
the d seems to take photos with less delay than many of todays pointandshoot digital cameras
on the down side its easy to forget to flip up the flashi recommend this accessorie for you palm m
its better than the hotsync cable since it gives you a place to put your palm
but i only give it  stars since it should have came instead of the hotsync cable when you buy the palm m
i really do not understand why you need to buy the cradle in the palm m when in the other palms is not an accessorie
if you have the money and want to have a base station for you palm m then buy itif not then i recommend you to stay with the hotsync cable and save your money for other accessoriescharger and sycup cradle for a handheld device  a palm pilot
my son still ises it with no problemsi bought this for my wife almost a year ago and it is still in pretty good shapelets face it these faceplates are frivolous however they are fun and now inexpensive toopalmone m handheldare easy to remove and put in place once you get the hang of it
some colors are better than others a quick review followsoriginal black  use it in front of your boss
or your goth buddiessilver is ok   not bad but its nothing special either cell phonishpacific blue  very nice fine for the office toored  all the red colors are fine and tend to draw attentionblue mist  very attractive not out of line for work eitherarctic white  goes great with that ipodpurple passion  ghastly
remarkably horribleburl wood  this one is a real success
very very attractive and when used with thepalmone m series slim leather carrying caseit looks outstanding in any settingthere are other brands out there who make palm faceplates too
they usually arent quite as well made but offer choices you cant find elsewhere
two very nice colors available this way are titanium green and dalmation not exactly a color but very cool i put a photo of each in the photo sharing section
both colors can be found on palms web sitereluctantly ive been converting from paper to my new palm m
while i have gotten grafitti pretty well down it is a slow process for adding data
and forget taking notes with it
now i add in a lot of data using the palm desktop program but there are times im just without the computer and need to get more than a line or two of data inthis is where the keyboard shines
coming in its own case i just throw it into the briefcase and keep it handy
now when im at meetings or off doing some research the keyboard can come right out sit on the table and allow me to enter in info quickly and more importantly  accurately
those memo files can then be synced to the desktop copied and printed or emailed as needed
an invaluable tool that lets me make one more step away from carrying paper around all the time
the keys have a great feel and the resistance is just right to let me know im typing what i wantmy only caveat is i dont know how sturdy it will be in the long term but it seems to be built strong
highly recommendedi love my battered old palm iii with no suffixes
with pocketmirrors latest synch program on my pc i have no trouble synching with outlook  to be sure im almost out of memory but i muddle by
there is only one fly in my palm ointment  i have never mastered graffiti
after years of using the palm iii im still barely at  accuracy
consequently i was an early adopter of the palm keyboard
one of the great moments was a conference i attended at which everybody around me was using lap tops
i zipped out my palm keyboard whipped it open snapped on my palm and was the envy of everyone in sight
palm probably owes me hundreds of dollars in finders fees for that one eventthe palm keyboard is really a remarkable device
it folds down to next to nothing  smaller than a paperback novel
it slips easily into a jacket pocket
yet it unfolds into a near fullsize keyboard with remarkably accurate and lifelikequot action
it is actually easier to type on the palm keyboard than on my dell laptop
taking notes or entering multiple contact data let alone writing emails of any length is now a breezewhy did i subtract one star
first several friends who bought the palm keyboard have had hardware andor software problems
one has had to return the keyboard  times
i have had no dififculties but your mileage may vary
second the keyboard cannot be used on your laptop
unless you have it on a hard surface it tends to sag in the middle
third i had to fiddle with the settings a long time to get the keyboard delay right
those quibbles aside however i highly recommend it to any power palm useri bought the ebookman for  a few years ago
the unit is just small enough to fit in a shirt pocket but large enough with  font sizes to read
the mp music sounds good for me but it was meant more for audio books
i would prefer the backlight to be brighter
sure it uses batteries even while off and if they die then you will lose all data
i never had a problem with that because i use a multimedia card that has the entire system backed up
its easy to backup daily
i use nimh bats
when bats die i pop in fresh nihms and the unit automatically restores the system with all the data
its a great deal for 
mine is still working after  years of use
the pen does lock in so i never lost itupdate june  i stumbled across some files for the ebookman on my computer and thought i would reread the comments about this reader
it still works well and all info is still on my mmc memory card
the screen is almost  including the write area
i still think it was a great buy for 
most of the negative reviews were people who never bought a cheap memory card for it or never backed up the system on their computer
even though franklin has stopped supporting it years ago it can still be used for reading books or listing to audible books and it is better for reading outdoors in bright light than current color tablets
with no wifi it takes much more effort to load books onto the ebookman but still can be done
i no longer use it since i have a few tablets that read epub and kindle books right from the librarya lot of people have already reviewed this so ill just address some of the negative comments ive seen
battery life this uses  aaa batteries
i highly suggest having and using at least  sets of rechargeable batteries because the batteries last only about  days with regular reading and using the backlight
youll save yourself a lot of money by just using rechargeables
losing everything when you change out the batteryreloading the operating system on amazon i bought a  mb mmc card for  thats including the shipping
you can backup the operating system and your books onto the mmc card
if the batteries run out or you change them the ebm  will automatically restore from the mmc card so that you wont have to restore from your pc
even if you do restore from your pc it takes only a few minutes but the mmc option is more convenient
lack of books i noticed that some people seem to think therere a lack of books for this reader
the reader includes mobipocket reader and therere thousands of books available at   and  to name just a few
youll have no problem finding books for this readeroverall i like this reader
it fits in my hand and isnt heavy
page turning is done either by a toggle wheel on the side or by tapping the left or right side of the screen
it fits in my jean and coat pockets so its easy to carryi do plan to eventually upgrade to either the barnes and noble nook or the forthcoming alex reader when it comes out at borders but for now this works fine for my needs
the reason ill upgrade is because i do like the eink display on the newer readers
however one advantage of the ebm is that it has a back light display which makes reading in bed at night much more convenient than having to use a separate booklight
theres no way to back light the eink readers so youll need a separate book lightwhat i like about it i own ebm open platform thus lots of useful free software available generic aaa batteries support
simple usb interface
large screen
good handwriting recognition
sturdy and reliable case
low power consumption
good music playback qualitynow about its wellknown problems folks backup your data on your mmc
this way you will never lose your os and apps
come on
the device does have a power backup in the form of a capacitor which is really bad and it hardly does anything
for a techie it is not hard to put in a differect capacitor
problem solved
sometimes it helps keep memory intact if you pull out one dead battery and put it a fresh one then pull out another one and replace it with freshyou cannot manage your files on mmc from within the ebms os
who knows if ectaco will ever release a new version of the osotherwise i love my ebookman i use it all the time its my primary mobile library and i am quite hesitant to look elsewere for a new pdai bought my ebm a few days back and it is better than i thoughtpositives light and compact
easy to carry very easy to set up once you read the manual great ui easy to use backlit display is a great feature mp player and ebook reader todo list address book and calendarnegatives less memory for your contentjust mb after you install the os and other meaningful software backlight makes a weird sound when usedvery low but can be heard at night when it is quiet consumes batteries like a monstori knew all these problemsexcept  before i bought the device
i was alo prepared to invest to upgrade to  mb and buy rechargable batteries
so now i have a great book reading device and mp player that i use everywherethis is an amazingly capable device
in just a couple of hours i was able to install applications build a text book from a project gutenberg source download and read current news articles and listen to an audio book from audiocomif the device has a weak point it is the handwriting recognition
i vaguely prefer graffitiphysically the device seems much more together than the early palm pilots didthe new palm viix handheld lets you access the best of the internet  communicate via email and stay on top of your information wirelessly and  easily
with  mb of memory you can customize the palm vllx handheld with  your choice of hundreds of web clipping applications and thousands of  thirdparty addon applications
trade stocks get quotes news items or  sport scores look up addresses flight information or weather forecasts  and send and receive email virtually anywhere
with more web clipping  applications and more memory the palm vllx handheld gives you the best of  the internet where and when you want it
memory   mbaddresses   appointments   yrsmemos  emails  battery  type  aaabattery life based on normal use   weeksaddons via  serial portintegrated wireless internet accessdisplay backlit the  best of the best for all of you electronics nutsfor  years i owned a palm iii
it was great  organized my time appts schedules phone numbers contacts etc
a few months ago i got the palm vii  for wireless access
so far i have used the wireless mapquest and other services like email virtually every provider can be accessed through this so if you need wireless access get this
otherwise if you just need an organizerjust go for the palm iiithis was such an excellent handheld and the wireless was so easy to use
its a shame they gave up on it and thought that the wireless web abilities in my cell phone was a replacement
this is anything but the truth
the palm vii could get email news weather taxi cabs book hotels lookup information in an online dictionary or encyclopedia and do so much more
the advantage was that these things could be done within seconds while driving down the highway in the forest or wherever you were at
i used this thing very heavily when i was on a vacation in florida and did so much that would take forever to accomplish with a gps cell phone or device with a web browser
the palm vii lacked a browser because they are slow and take forever to get information over a device like thisso sad they had to discontinue palmnet and so sad that the majority of people out there are so ignorant
this device never caught on with the public
but it will be forever rememberedfirst returned my handspring visor delux because of the usb connection was unstable with my win k machine
decided to go with the wireless palm
the palm side is great it has a faster cpu then the handspring and the updated palm os
the serial hotsync works every time
battery life is poor because of the fact it is always charging the transmitter
thus if you never go on line
dont buy this modelthe m or handspring delux with mb of mem is finethe palm service is very expensive and not worth it at allbut as for the palm it is great and works finei have been using my palm viix about a week now and definitely like it
as a deaf individual the wireless email is as close as i can get to being on an equal footing with cell phone users
the service plans offered by palmnet actually appear to be cheaper than service plans offered by skytelcom for their motorola text paging devices
the ideal solution for me would be a cell phone costing not more than  with a monthly service plan of not more than  and no data transfer charges
it would send and recieve text messages and surf the web anywhere in the world and talk to any wireless network anywhere for exactly the same price
we dont have priceperformance like that yet
so i took the viix because i was impatient for wireless email
now i have a minimally frustrating way of getting in touch with family while im on the road
its really nice being able to carry all  of my contacts and a few tons of notes in a  ounce package
is it worth my 
i am willing to pay that much just for the wireless email
wireless web clippings appear to be well beyond my financial means at this time
as for the rest of the device i dont know its true worth to me yet and suspect i  will not for several more monthslinux users you can hotsync a palm to a linux machine
look for the pilotlink software for your distribution and be sure to check the oreilly web site for their palm articles
pilotlink however is focused on a serial hotsync connection
how about a little usb software too
there is for red hat users but it is not targeted expressly for the palm
if you have red hat  look carefully in your kernel sources for a module named visorc
open it in emacs and youll discover it is usbsupport code for hotsyncing a handspring visor
methinks with just a little work it can be ported to the palm also since the  devices use the palm osthe palm viix has fairly severe limitations the hotsync cradle ought to ship as usb hardware with a true usb interface just as the handspring devices do
my desktop computer only has one free serial port and that is in use for my modem
thats a tipoff that im a linux user
few new computers have more than one rs serial port
old computers had  or  but new ones usually give you just one and a bunch of usb ports
since a serial cradle ships standard i may have to spend another  for the usb connector
im thinking i might be able to go to compusa and pick up a serial port card for a lot less than the palm usb kit
is there such a card
hmmm
i think a usb option should be offered to palm users free
it should be easy to connect to a home network but is not
the viix is just another computing device
if you can hook it into a windows or linux based network either with an ethernet cable connection or wirelessly you can surf the web on a far cheaper landline connection without needing palmnet
palm os  has tcpip code for making network connections
the interfaces palm documents are through a serial ppp slip or cslip connection
that means a hardwarebased connection
i can assign the device an ip address or it can use dhcp
i should also be able to assign a hostname like bobspalmlingpgmrcom
but wait a minute
id like to sit down on my sofa with a strong overhead light and literally tap the viix into a wireless network connection to my home network
that must be possible because the handbook documents how to change the ip address of the proxy server and there is now or soon will be wireless ethernet connectivity hardware available for the homei should have a relatively easier time turning the palm into a pppbased network client in linux than in windows
but i would still be tied to the hotsync cradle instead of relaxing on my easy chair and checking my stock account
the palm os seems braindamaged
for example i can only have shortcuts of up to  characters in length each
why that limitation
why not k or more to each shortcut
that way i can use shortcuts to help fill in boilerplate text entries in datebook or my to dos
im limited to how many categories i can have as well
why impose such arbitrary limitations
i might need  or  or  or  categories
the person next door might need  thats flexibility
memos and notes are limited to k in length each
if you sync to outlook  an outlook note can be k long
there goes your notes if they are longer than k
contacts in outlook  can have a large number of fields such as quotnicknamequot that the conduit will throw away no matter how badly i want access to them
what happens then
you suddenly find yourself reinventing the wheel spending your valuable time paring existing data to fit the handheld platform when it really ought to be exactly the other way around the handheld should accept whatever is thrown at it from the desktop application so that you can press that button and go
instead of finding yourself with a mirror image of a desktop database you have  very different databases and each requires time to customize
what a waste
i think this is the fault of the palm os and very shortsighted design decisions
if you must reinvent the wheel someone was stupid somewhere
i agree with all the other complaints made by others
the screen especially is very hard to see and use
i hate the greyscales and the reflectiveness of the screen and the difficulty of writing grafitti
you have to be really determined to enter a lot of text using grafitticomplaints like these plus the presence of the handspring platform may work to bring some humility to the palm folks and convince them to make the palm much more user and network friendly
if you are considering buying this device waiting a year or so might not be a bad ideai purchased these to do some organizing in my drop ceiling
wrap this around a couple of cables and you are good to goi am giving these  stars instead of  because i have found that they do not last too long when exposed to outdoor elements
i know that using them for christmas lights and in the garden are not how they were intended but i did it anyway
i found that they would only last a portion of the season before they became brittle and would break
i probably should use thicker ones for applications like this but i still would have liked them to last a little longer than thati always keep these around the house as i always seem to find uses for themif i need a longer tie i can just attach these to each otheri use them for tying up cords handing things and organizing my garagei am nit sure how strong they are but for the things i am using them for they are just perfectgood productwhat can i say about wire ties
these are really good for the price
have you ever priced these in the store
i dont expect to use these outside in the weather or to withhold a lot of pressure so these will work just fine for my purposethey are cable ties
they work for me
they were just an add on to get my free shipping so i really didnt take a loss if they didnt worki use these things all the time and a big pack like these fit my needs perfectly
good value for the moneyi received this item very quickly and immediately noticed they were not twice the size of the  ones that came in the same box upon measuring them they are  zip ties in a package labeled  and has a label stuck over the label on the bag however the old label also says  so i am not sure what happened especially since they fit in the bag  i did not bother contacting the seller as if the packaging was mislabeled i was more likely to get the same item the next time i believe the ones i bought were sold not by amazon but stored in an amazon website thus the double labelsanyway they are thick and sturdy ties not likely to break easily however out of the  that i have used successfully i had to trash  already that did not have a lock in them at all
if that averages out across the entire pack ill have closer to  failure rate
considering the price a penny plus  shipping that is not such a good deal
the  ties i purchasedamico  pcs mm x mm self locking wire cable zip tie  blackwere  in a bag  and free shipping apparently they are no longer available at that price i should have bought  or  bags also ive used more than  of them with out one failing at that rate it would be cheaper to connect x ties together instead of buying  ties that are really  when i only actually needed  ties but could not find any for sale at a reasonable priceoverall it is not as though i bought something for a couple hundred dollars i can still use them and cut them smaller as needed
i bought this for the cuttingxuron  maxishear flush cutterand it works perfect clean nonsharp cuts right down the lock and has no problems even cutting these thicker tiesi took  star off for the failure rate and one for the quantity and price but i put one star back as when i added the link to the   ties i noticed the price i bought them at has changed to be more in line with the price i paid for the  onesthe good news is if i ever have to tie up someone who has broken into my house i can use these as long as i can find one that is not brokenthese do their job well and are priced right
make sure you are getting the size you really needwant it really matters these are the heavy duty version
that means extra heft and a bit stiffer than your smaller ties
these arent for delicate bundling but theyll shine where you need the strengthi bought these zip ties to put up christmas lights on my deck so i wouldnt have to nailstaple and they worked very wellthey work just as advertised and are in fact  inches long
they are secure enough for my purposes and easily trimmed to length after zippedi needed to prevent my cats from going between the vertical posts on the deck so i bought netting and then had to secure it without damaging the deck i live in a condo
these seemed like a good idea
ive used them to secure the netting and even wove them thru the bottom to prevent it from moving too much so the cats cant get between the main deck floor and the x used for the railing bottomits been up for almost a year now and survied sandyfor c this is a lot of fasteners some fairly strongi had to get these for a gun show and the ins were a bit short for handguns but were plenty strongi actually strung two and three together and they worked greati did notice they are rather brittle meaning they cut easy and may break under stressi would buy again but will likely last me a while thumbs way uptheres hardly any problem in life that cannot be sorted with cable ties
these work great theyre very strong and ive used them for everything from putting up signs to assembling an ebikethese are good ties in a useful variety of sizes
the quality is good and the zips actually lock in place
sometimes with cheap ties they dont securely hold their position
no trouble with this product buy with confidencei like the selection of sizes and the storage container
ive used these for tying up cables and holding things to each other
im not sure ill ever use all  but the price was good
clear color so unobtrusivefor fans of electronics particularly bleedingedge technologically packed gadgets nothing is sadder than knowing your particularly product is past its primesuch is the case with sonys dcrvxthis is not to say that sonys ccd prosumer minidv digital camcorder isnt a good product
for those familiar with the blair witch project that film was shot with the vx the predecessor to this model
the vx outdoes that previous model by adding digital snapshots that can be stored on sony memory sticks along with a  foldout lcd viewscreen
this is not your average consumer camcorderhaving three ccd imaging chips each one dedicated to red green or blue light puts this in a league with cameras that youll see in tv studios
youll find other pro features such as digital image stabilization builtin digital effects titling capability timers zebra shutter speed choices builtin manual and automatic mic leveling focus locks auto and manual focus on the x zoom color viewfinder neutral density filters spotlighting and backlighting controls fade in and out  the list goes on and ononce youve captured the video you have several ways of transferring it to other media via one of several ports rca firewire ieee  and svideo
playback is via the unit and it sports a full complement of vcrlike controls
the unit also comes with a very powerful remote that can control virtually every capability of the camera in both playback and recording modes
it takes minidv tapes in  minute lengths but can record  minutes when selecting tape speeds
tests have shown virtually no image degradation and only a slight loss in sound quality when recording at the slower  minutes speedfew camcorders can touch the battery life an astonishing  hours on a single charge with the optional npf battery or the actual image on tape
ive never seen a consumer camera with such beautiful color rendition or sharpness
everyone who sees recordings made by this camera is amazedbut as i mentioned before while state of the art in  changes in digital video technology are rendering the vx old news
this unit cannot record video that takes advantage of hdtv as its resolution is not high enough for that new standard
jvc has recently released a model that has similar capability to the vx but adds hdtv
panasonic is also changing the game by eliminating the achilles heels of the vx and all other camcorders the tape transport mechanism
theyve announced a completely solid state camera that records onto a series of compact memory media similar to the memory stick in the vx
the memory stick on the vx is only for snapshots not video
since the most likely parts of any electronic device to fail are the mechanical ones having no transport mechanism means a far more reliable unit
such a system also does away with tapes another weaknesswith this in mind the ideal customer for the vx has a dilemma with new technology on the market but priced a bit higher for now is it wise to buy the vxthere are other issues too
the vast majority of people will be satisfied with the capability of singleccd units
some of sonys singleccd units are mindblowingly tiny far smaller than the very bulky vx
they also take higher resolution snapshots than the vx something to keep in mind if you want a digital camera and a digital camcorder in one unitdo i recommend the vx
absolutely
it is a stunningly powerful and capable camcorder
however it is getting long in the tooth and no longer is the unit of choice for consumers who want the cream of the crop and the latest technologyi do like this bag
its small light and sturdy
it has a small front pouch for cf cards and spare batteries or battery pack
you can attach it to your belt or use the adjustable shoulder strap
very versatile
it would have easily gotten  stars if it had just a little more room
i have a canon powershot g and the fit is snug which is what i wanted
however theres no room for any cords and barely room for the neck strap on my camera
the digital  bag could have used one thin long pouch on the side for extra little camera accessoriesif you dont have a camera larger than the canon g and most are not larger and you want a bag thats compact and well built but only has enough room for the bare necessities instead of a lot of pouches and pockets for extra items then this bag should suit you very nicely
its perfect if you want a camera bag that is small and unobstrusive but have no desire to carry any extras while youre on the goi bought this for a digital camera and spare memory cards and batteries
it holds all of those and room for a bit more
there is good padding that i am sure i will be thankful for when i drop it
heavy duty yes but light weight
its not slim at about quot thick
comes with a detachable shoulder strap and a builtin belt loop
it has combo clip and velcro front flapi have an olympus  and this bag fits just right
i can get the camera in a battery charger and an extra memory card
thats all that fits perfectly though
the usb cable doesnt fit inif you want a bag for a smaller camera this is great
the clips on the strap are solid metal and the inside compartment is useful in that it has places for batteries and memory cards
if you get anything bigger than a traditional pointandshoot though you should look a little harder for a better suited bagi purchased the tamrac  bag for my canon s digital camera
the bag is a little too big for my camera
however by using the recommendation of another reviewer of stuffing a sock into the bottom of the bag i was able to ensure a snug fit around my camera
the bag has little pockets for the compact flash and memory
the top of the bag is fastened by a clip and velcro on the front face of the bag
the fastening method does secure the camera in the bag but i would hesitate to put any loose items in with the camera since the top flap could easily let unsecured items slip out of the bag
overall a good bag but a zipper around the top would have been more appropriatei bought this camera case for my sony h zoom camera
the camera fits great there is no wobble it fits securely
it will also hold your lens hood and adapter ring spare batteries and extra memory
but it wont hold your battery charger or manual
it will also be a tight fit to get your av and usb cables in
they might go in but i think it would harm my memory sticks so im leaving them out
this is the bag for you for day trips or an overnight journey especially if you only want the bare essentials
but if youre leaving for a week and want to take everything with you as i usually do youd be better off with a small camcorder bag instead
the case is very sturdy but its not waterproof so forget about those flume ridesi have two smaller tamrac digital series bags and have been very pleased with the construction looks and convenience of them
i am likewise impressed with the tamrac  digital  bagunfortunately despite amazons description that this is built for larger digital cameras and smaller digital camcorders i will have to return the bag as it is too small to fit my panasonic camcorder and accessories
the camcorder itself panasonic hdctmk hidef camcorder fits ok but there really isnt enough room left over to hold the ac battery charger plus cord a component video andor hdmi cable extra battery and camcorder remote
i ended up getting alowepro cameracamcorder bag exat a local store which is about  taller and  wider and has enough extra room to carry the tmk plus accessories comfortably
amazonslowepro adventura  camera caseappears to have dimensions similar to the ex
so just a suggestion to consider not just the camera or camcorder youll be carrying but also the accessories you need to bring
if it all fits in the  then this bag is a solid choicethis bag is very good for a dslr with  zooms and a macro
it also holds cleaning supplies flash unit and chargerive had this camera pack for a while now and i just cant live without it
after reading tons of reviews and researching other sites and stores i decided this would fit my needs bestits small light weight and carries everything inside it without drawing attention to itself
i can carry my canon d with all my accessories plus a few personal extras all day without back pain or tiring out
trust me when its mardi gras in the big easy that means a loti carry the following in my packwhile i was able to fit everything listed below inside mind you its tightly packedcanon d with mm lens attached without hood and strap kit lenspromaster external flash unit with  stofen omni bounce diffusersbackup camera battery with charger packs of aa batteries for flash unitall my owners manuals plus a medium sized handbook im a beginnerlens cloth and small airblower bottle for lens cleaningcords for hooking camera to tv and pc backup memory cards the red flap is extremely handy to keep track of used cardssmall notebook  pen few personal items such as chapstick headband etccell phone hooked on the outsidewater bottle hooked on the outsidesunglasses in outer pocket meant for the tripodplus size  perfect for a medium sized female
construction  extremely well made sturdy fabric lots of padding and does a great job at keep humidity out big deal down here organized  with its repositionableremovable compartment dividers packing what you need is a breezeplus there are lots of hooks  such on the outside for additional optionsand you can add a tripod if you choose
color makes it look like any normal back pack
price was great for what i gotminusvery minor but these are my reasons for giving  opposed to  stars rain flap over zippers make opening and closing somewhat combersome but you get used to it
besides its like an extra layer of protection both from rain and thieving hands if you want to fit an external flash along with extra lenses you may consider a larger bag
it doesnt really do a great job at carrying my tripod
it becomes too difficult to get my camera in and out of the pack with a tripod attached you have to remove the tripod before you are able to open the bag not the most convenient while walking aroundpretty good small bag
although a little tight for the camera body since it is positioned near the top where the pack is curved there is plenty of padding and a tight fit does not cause any harm to the camera
the pads wear a little and the fit gets better over time so this is not really a big deal but it did make me worry initially
the padded velcro dividers in the bag can be positioned just about anywhere to make any combination of compartments
the bag also has a ton of extra pockets and compartments that were able to handle all my storage media cables batteries etc
i have room for the camera two other lenses and the lens hoods on the inside
i am still trying to figure out if i can include my compact conventional film camera in the bag somewhere
another great thing about the design of the pack is that the bag readily accepts other velcro attached accessories for water bottles film or other gear
i may see if my other camera will fit that way
there are two issues that might be a problem
 for the pros is that the bag is too small to handle larger lenses and professional gear
 for the beginner is that it is  the size of a regular backpack and not as convenient as a plain mm camera case if you are just headed out to the family picnic
one general gripe is that the straps will defninitely be a pain for those that prefer to carry it as a tote rather than wear it
they are not detachable
if they were this would be nearly perfect for my needs
that said im pretty happy with it and i wont be looking for any other casesi bought a larger version of this bag previously and i like the comfort of carrying in on my back
this bag i bought the expedition  was usedhowever it was in good shape
nothing torn or missing
i would recommend this productalmost too little for a backpack
it just doesnt sit well on the handsome build i had  plenty of compartments excellently built  high quality too
remember this only holds a minitripod not a normal sized onethis backpack is a very high quality product and is very compact too compact for me
i was so pleased with the quality however that i returned the item and just got the next size up the expedition this is definitely worth it if your a beginner or just a hobbyist but even if your a season pro it has its advantages
i bought this bag about ten years ago and i still swear by it
i will agree with most of the other users in that its small and cumbersome to a point
you have to think open about this though
it makes you think what you really need therefore eliminating clutter and making hiking much more manageable
also its great for metropolitan work in that it looks like a regular bag
it wont be so obvious to prying eyes to what you have therefore making yourself less of a target unless your carrying a tripod with youthis is a well made bag which can carry most all of your camera needs
i found it works well to carry on my camera on airplane trips
i can pack  lenses and a slr camera body
room for accessories and a way to strap on a small tripod makes this a good bag for hikingwell worth the cost for the valueim not sure why people are complaining about this backpack being so small since the description and pictures are accurate though it looks smaller in real life and the scale is not all that obviousi easily fit a medium sized camera with a  lens attached and and an  lens directly below it
i dont have other lenses to fill up the side partitions of the main compartment but could easily fit  to  more lenses depending on size in these areas
the sides of the main compartment seem a bit tighter to fit things in howevereven being conservative this pack should fit a camera with lens attached  additional lenses and a flash in the main compartmentin the smaller front pocket i fit  memory cards compact lens cleaning kit larger lens cloth  aa batteries compact charger
a minitripod or compact water bottle would fit in the outside pocketstrapdont expect to carry huge amounts of additional things in this pack aside from additional small items like keys wallet map cell phoneyoure not going to be putting your thermos picnic lunch and jacket in here
its not even as big as most computer backpacks but it certainly doesnt claim to be
you might fit some small additional items but not anything bulkythe construction seems good and its reasonably rigid and well padded
its a good value for the pricethis is a good backpack for someone with a small amount of equipment
i use it with my nikon d which usually has the  zoom attached
its easy to get that combination in and out without completely unzipping the bag
i also carry my sb flash and there is room for a couple fixed or small zoom lenses as well
the bag will also accept a small book up to trade paperback size or notepad lying flat on top of the equipmentthe outside pocket is good for temporary storage of filters while youre shooting
its not my style but if you like to have your phone clipped to the backpack straps its set up for that
when i was shooting at the airventure show i used those clips to carry my aviation radioone thing that can be a little frustrating is that the tolerances around the zippers are pretty tight meaning that it can occasionally be a little tough to get the zippers to move
the upside of that is that the zippers are pretty well protected from light rain if youre wearing this as a backpacklike most backpacks youll need to grab some of the straps to avoid having them drag on the ground if youre using the top carry handlethe tripod holder is useful
you cant put a monster tripod on there but any basic  leg tripod would work just fine
the straps that hold tripods in place are not fastened to the backpack they loop through straps on the bag so there is some potential for losing them if they arent closed after use
the plus of that is that they are replaceable and if you needed something different it would be easy to install
its not clear whether the tripod straps are enough to hold a monopod in placeoverall build quality is excellent
i expect the one i have to last for several yearsalthough this is a small bag you can fit the essentials in it i carry my nikon d with a couple of lenses the charger and the lens cleaning kit and that all fits fine
i would have rated it a  but due to the tripod straps the main bag zipper can be a bit tricky to openthe tamrac system  camera bag is perfect for slr owners who also have one or two compact lenses eg the typical mm or mm zoom lens in addition to the lens attached to the camera plus a small external flash
the bag is small compared to other slr gadget bags but the inside can be partitioned in flexible ways
its also wellpadded both inside and outside
it also has lining pockets for things like usb cables camera body cap lens caps filters etc
at the front theres a compartment for miscellaneous items such as film memory cards pens lens cleaning paper etc
hidden behind this is a pullout pouch for batteries and memory cards plus an id tag kinda hard to write on though
you can also use the compartment this pouch is in to store film etc although stuff might fall out if you are not careful
at the back is another compartment which i use to store the manual of my nikon das you can see this small bag is very versatile
in addition you can get tamracs addon pouches and pockets to attach to the strap or the sides of the bag for additional storagei looked at many bags before settling on this one
its compact and weighs about  pounds so its material enough to withstand tough conditions yet light enough for shoulderuse
as i mentioned its also well padded and can accommodate extensions
if you are the typical slr enthusiast with a total of  compact lenses andor a small flash unit youll find this bag a very good fit for your needsi recently reviewed a camera bag that looked by the picture like it would handle my needs
longstoryshort it didnt and i should have questioned the image vs dimensions but i dont want to revisit that one again
since that review i sold all of my  gear and went with the micro  format
my old camera bag which i purchased back in the late s was a tamrac and i carried it through many airports up and down the mountain trails in colorado and it always protected my gear
its been showing some signs of wear and i chose this tamrac bag as its replacement judged by the photo and dimensions
while i havent moved all my stuff into it completely i just wanted to let you know that i didnt have any problems put my panasonic gh and gkk camera bodies in it along with the following lenses all panasonic lumix mm mm mm mm and a mm in the main compartment
i see no reason i wont be able to put various accessories in it either and just in time for a field trip
this was well worth the price paidsaw this case in a camera store and it was exactly what i wanted except for the price
looked around online and found this one at a fairprice and purchased it
very good quality with enough pockets and seperators to keep all you need at a monents graspi wanted a case that could store all my gear and be used to transport it by vehicle
it will hold two prodslrs if you cannibalized the space below them which means that a lens will never fit in those spaces shown in the diagram
standard dslrs with fit easily
it is a very good case but it would not allow me to store two pro dslrs and seven lenses and three flashes
i just had too much gear for the case so it has been returned
it is very well made
i should have probably considered the super pro   it does look like it would be easy to carry using the handle or the carrying strap
just remember that the diagram shows two cameras without grips in order to place lenses below the bodies
the spaces are narrow so that any mounted large fast lense may crowd out other lensesi need a big but not too big bag so that i can have most of my things camera lenses flash etc
there and are still able to carry it around on my shoulder
i got the  ultra pro first
that s a good bigger bag
i can have almost all my things in there but it is too big for me to carry it around as a shoulder bag
then i got  thats way too small and the description isnt accurate for its size
this one  is a good balance for me
it is not as big as some claim
smaller than this one would be difficult to have a fullframe dslr and a few lenses there
even at the  size i cannot have all my lenses there
with two cameras it is inadequate
but this is a compromise shoulder bag
ill keep it
the downside for improvement is organization of the compartments
with long or wide lenses one has to reorganize the spaces because most are too small for lenses with hood on
if you switch lenses often and dont want to take the hood onoff often there is  a good chance you wont like the way the compartments are divided
the two layers room arrangement is inconvenient but im not certain there is a better alternative for a  shoulder bag
well i may have to keep the  as well because that one gives you much easier access of things quickly
but it is just too big as a shoulder bag to carry around for long
overall  is a good balance for a serious photographer amateur or professionali bought and then returned four bags before staying with this one
is it perfect
of course not theres no such perfect camera bag
backpack
sling
rolling
shoulder
i wish there was one that had the benefits of all of these but it doesnt exist
the backpack i had been using is wonderful for having both hands free but it doesnt hold enough and when the kodak moment came along i had to wriggle out of it put it on the ground regardless of how messy the ground might be and then zip it open to get the camera out
whoops  my subject was gone
the  is heavy when full of my gear but i dont have to leave anything out and i can get my camera out quickly when i need it
like all tamrac products its made of strong materials and can take a beatingthis is a great value for the money
i originally bought a smaller lowe camera case at a local retailer and tried unsuccessfully to jam my olympus evolt  two lenses and a flash into it
the lowe bag cost as much as the tamrac did at amazon
the tamrac fits everything in an easy organized way and is very well madethe bags construction is very good with enough padding for your typical camera buff
it held my d with  lenses and the sb flash easily
the side pockets are great for chargers and anything that wont fall out easily as they only close with a velcro fastener
the back pocket is great for paperwork and the front pocket has plenty of pockets for all sorts of accessoriesthe one thing i wasnt crazy about was the wasted space that you end up with using the interior dividers in the provided configuration
there is space below the camera body thats very hard to get into without removing the velcrod dividers
i ended up not using any of them and instead inserting a smaller bag i own that holds the camera and two lenses
then i sandwich the flash in its pouch and a small tabletop tripod in the remaining space
sounds crazy but it works better
also cool if i want to grab the camera and just use the small bag for a quick shoot or for a lighter bag for a days travel leaving the larger tamrac bag at home or in the car
this way you dont have to move the camera and vital accessories from one bag to anotherall this got me thinking
tamrac could create a system like this kind of like a backpack i own the camelbak transformer that allows one to remove sections depending on the hike youre planningtamracs  camera bag is well constructed sturdy and versatile and is suitable for use with either film or digital slr cameras
it is a midsized bag designed to carry up to two camera bodies
the crucial issue with this type of bag is whether it has adequate space to carry exactly what you need including lenses and larger accessories like flash units and battery packs
check tamracs website and look at the diagrams showing the interior compartments of the bag and how components may be stored and judge if theres enough space for the particular gear you havethe interior of the bag can be divided into up to six smaller compartments
the layout is designed to accept a body with a zoom lens up to around  inches in length attached
while a camera with a long lens will fit in the bag youll have arrange things carefully if you want to carry too much else
also this setup does not work well if you have a battery grip attached
one solution is to store the camera and grip with no lens attached
doing this there is more than adequate space for the body and three or four lens and a flash unit
stored vertically a long lens can be accommodated with no problem
carrying your gear this way youre not immediately prepared to shoot as you must take a few moments to assemble the camerathough the bag is really better suited to accommodating the gear to fully outfit one camera
in a pinch the  can accommodate two camera bodies even with battery packs but that will leave just about a third of the available space for lenses and a flashthere is a zippered fold down compartment with pockets in the front
it would be nice if the pockets had some kind of fasteners
pouches with velco fasteners are on the side of the bag
velcro is an extremely poor design choice
one should not risk putting valuable or heavy items into these pouches
they could easily be lost or fall out and be broken should the fasteners fail to hold
this wasted storage space is the bags major flaw
some type of modification would be required to make them truly usefulthe  has an excellent heavy duty carrying strap and also has straps at the base for carrying a tripod
a semi useful feature is a wallet for carrying digital media and other small accessories
the wallet is attached to the bag with an elastic strip and sides into a compartment on the side of the bag
the padding in bottom and sides could stand to be a bit thicker but that can be said of most bagsas with any camera bag its ultimate usefulness depends on the user and the particular gear to be carried
the  isnt quite perfect in all situations but it is adaptable enough to be useful most of the time
available in several colorsive had my nomad jukebox gig for about a year now and i still love it
sure its got its cons but overall it is a cool reliable and swanky little bit of electronicshere are the conseasy to useone you get the hang of it
i agree that the documentation for the unit is pretty substandard and the interface is nonintuitive
but once you work your way through it and become accustomed to it it is easy to useeasy to add delete make play lists etcupload and downloadmove stuff from your pc onto your jukebox then back again
some reviewers have said they cant do this but i do it all the time
no probsbattery lifeabout  hours with each set of batteriesand you get two sets
thats pretty good
warning  when they say  hours the first time you charge they mean  hours
any less and youve screwed your batteries for goodplaycenter softwareactually this is easier to use and more intuitive than the jukeboxs internal software
great easy reliable and fastconsthe carry case sucksbuy another quickly
i bought the larger padded case from creative with plenty of room for headphones a car adapter extra batteries
and it has zippered access to the ports so you dont have to haul it out every time you want to connect itummmthats it reallyalthough i wish it played audible content
maybe a future upgradean excellent buy especially now that you can get a gig oneive had  days to live with this thing extensively and i thought id share with you what ive found out
the rating is really  stars but i just cant give it a perfect score for the price they are askingthe jukebox is excellent for what it does which is put every cd you own at your fingertips
you should know yourself if you have a use for this or not
the jukebox is perfect in the car or at work where it is unfeasable to bring  cds along
you dont have to change cds and you can edit the playlists to reflect your tastes at any given moment
when i was sick for a week i had my complete collection at my bedside
long trips would also be an excellent time for the jukeboxseek time between songs is about the same as the pause between songs on a cd
the hard drive inside makes noise but i wasnt distracted by it
the case is exactly the size of a portable cd player and only an ounce or two heavier
the jukebox is creatives flagship model so everything is high quality
the package includes a nice carrying case excellentsounding headphones which are a bit tight extra batteries all the cables etcif you have extremely sensitive ears dont expect any mp player to have true cd audio quality
this is a compressed audio format so you get what you pay for
i love the sound quality but a recording studio technician might hate it
and dont expect to take this jogging
although it can be done the jukebox is certainly not made it
it is designed to be used on a desktop plugged into the wallunfortunately the battery life is way too short
you will need to buy a power adapter for every location you use the jukebox regularly
ie
home work the car  carrying around the power cord defeats the purpose of portability
a power cord for the car is not includedlastly the price of the jukebox and mp players in general is way to high
be careful that it doesnt get stolenand the final test  i use this everyday
i love it
navigation is easy everything is easy
i certainly got my moneys worthi bought this play with high hopes and most of them are met
the unit plays well
the battery life is a little weak but creative labs is very thoughtful and includes a second set of batteries
it recharges fast enough and i usually listen when its plugged in anyhow
be carefull of using regular batteries they will be drained within  hours
on the good side this does as expected plays many hours of music sounds great and is easy to navigatethe down side isi would like to see bettter support through the webstie from creative labs
this is a costly item it would be great to have web chat or something to get simple answersthe software is not the best
when i try to rip mps from a cd the first track is always messed up
i have to rip the first track from the cd to the hard drive and then trasfer to the cd
this is annoying because i am trying to save space on my hard drivewma files are supposed to offer better sound quality at lower kb rates so therefore smaller files so more can be stored on the jukebox
but i cant seem to get the same quality when ripping from cd to wma with the play center software included
i get better wma sound using windows media player but again that goes to the hard drive then to the jukeboxi also cant figure out how to trasnfer from the jukebox to a pc
the jukebox comes with a couple audio books that i would like to put onto pc and make room on the nomad for more musicoverall the next version of the jukebox should be great
it needs a bigger drive maybe  gig
it also could use a tuner for fm signals to make it more of a complete product
i would also love to see a digital out to plug into a good quality stereo
i would say people should hold off buying until the next gen of players are on the market
but if you want something that holds  cds now  if i could figure out how to get the higher quality wma files on it its as good as it getsps
be ready to buy some headphones
the included ones are not very goodokay first off the battery life is arguably the worst ive ever seen
i think a nonwaterproof watch at the bottom of a pool might run longer than this thing
but im in no mood to test thatsecondly the playlist navigation is almost a joke
when in random mode or shuffle mode yes those are two seperate modes  how novel skipping forward plays a new and completely unexpected song
good
skipping backwards however does not play the last song you heard
no its essentially exactly the same as pressing the forward key
what
who thought this upif youre thinking that isnt all that annoying  how about this
if you shift from quotrandomquot or quotshufflequot mode to quotoncequot mode during song play the device completely forgets what the heck is going on
it will continue to play the active song but display on the lcd panel the very first song on your playlist
next it will play the second song and the screen will catch up to itself
completely unacceptable
it should continue to play and display the active song and then proceed in order through your playlist from that pointsigh
using this thing drives me crazy
and mastering its operation is almost selfdefeating
as you get better at being familiar with the intricacies of how to navigate the device you can quickly advance to the point of being faster than the device
key response time needs help and desperatelybut all in all what do i think
well i love it
i mean as long as i dont touch it or look at it its great
it was designed to be listened to and for that well wow it really excells
songs sound amazing and the idea of leaving my apartment with every cd i own all in my pocket  well cmon now  thats just darn cool
creative needs desperately to get their act together with the firmware but the hardware itself is definately worth the pricefyi  i have hacked my nomad with a gb harddrivethings i loveevery cd i own is on the nomadyou can copy data files to ityou can do live recordings with itthings i wish were betteri wish i could just use this as a usb harddrivei wish the batteries didnt run out so quicklyi wish it was smalleri have had nothing but a good time with my nomad
creative had some issues with the operating system on this thing when it first came out but not too many big issues left to deal with
there were some people who had trouble with the hardware and batteries but i wasnt one of them
i bought thisso even if i hated it i would like it just because it cost so damn muchive been waiting for something like this for forever
ive gone through my share of mp players minidisc players walkmans and discmans but so far nothing has had the versatility that the nomad jukebox has
my problem is that whenever i travel i insist that i cant survive without bringing my entire cd collection and its annoying and risky to lug around that many cds
minidiscs provided a solution for a while but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording amp editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program
mp players like the rio  amp nomad ii are great for day use amp jogging but most of the time  hour just doesnt cut it
mpcd players dont seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a cd burner amp carry around cds
the nomad jukebox is for people who want a massive amount of music  gigs  hours which is x more than most mp players at around the same price for use over a long period of time or at homethe jukebox comes bundled with software for playcenter  for the pc or soundjam for macs to use for ripping cds amp mps from your computer to the jukebox
it also comes with decent headphones loudness is not a problem amp a carrying case plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up
setup is pretty easy and using the software is a lot more intuitive than i though it would be
it takes me around  minutes to rip a cd from my computer the the nomad
the best feature by far is the omd description searcher if youre online while your ripping cds the omd finds the album name year released genre artist amp all the track names so you dont have to type anything in
you can also rip mps from the nomad back to your computer
the songs in the nomad can be categorized under albums artists genres or play lists to make it easier to navigate
it supports data mp wma and wav files plus many others
you can download updates from the nomad website for better software or firmware for the player so even if something isnt perfect now in the future improvements will be available
the player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions like a remote control
it comes with  hours of free music mostly classical and some audio books
it includes jacks for linein recording from radios microphones or stereos  and lineout hookup to stereos or speakersof course the nomad jukebox is a very new kind of mp player so it has a few major flaws battery power hard drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power and thats exactly what the jukebox is a hard drive disguised as an mp player
you can only use the  rechargeable batteries that nomad gives you aa size to run it without the ac adapter and those only last around  hours by themselves
nomad includes an extra set of  to replace them but you always have to make sure they are fully charged
maybe in the future there will be more options battery pack
 weight  its around the size of a firstgeneration cd player and it weighs around  lbs with batteries
this isnt really a problem for me but it depends what you want to use it for
its not meant for use while jogging or biking etc its more for use over a long period of time away from home on the busplanedormin the car or at home plugged into the ac adapter and a pair of speakers
besides the weight in my opinion it looks very nice it has unique smooth design coloring and shape and the lcd screen is easy to readthe nomad jukebox is the best in its category of highcapacity mp players it holds  times more music than a normal mp player and its price has been drastically reduced making it a lot more affordable than it was before
overall i am very satisfied with it
it has its flaws but in the future there will be improvements amp upgrades available
it is the best option for anyone whos ever wished they could bring all their cds with them without actually having to carry them and i think that i will be using it for a long long time from nowmaster of nonepro holds over a thousand tracks
sounds great
versatile output headphones small speakers auxiliary jack on stereo pc
power adaptercharges batteries too
fairly portable
simple operation when connected to pc
bells and whistles with eq presets recording stuff ive never had the patience or knowledge to use well
you can add to the current play queue from the library without interrupting the music
it doesnt skip really
the ability to save playlists and edit them on the fly to reduce a thousand tracks worth of cds to the small size are really worth whatever you choose to spend on the privilegecon not all your music wherever you go as billedbut plenty of music anywhere youd care to carry it
there are far larger hard drives for sale since i got mine almost  years ago
its as bulky as a portable cd player and heavier than most
the battery power runs out too quickly
the user interface is lackingyou can get there from here but youre going to be hunched over your magic jukebox for a few minutes while you wait on slow refresh rates and clumsy controls
although it is featurerich it is clearly an early attempt at bringing the power of the technology into the hands of the average user
its almost as noisy as my laptop
the ir port on the front of it is smoke and mirrors a yet unfulfilled indication of future functionality
you cant create a playlist on the pc and drag it to the jukebox without reuploading those tracks to the device
this particular model came with nothing i cared to have in the way of preinstalled music and an unattractive inconvenient carrying case an extra set of rechargeable batteriesand cost significantly more than the nofrills c model of the jukebox that came out about six months laterthough its not everything id hoped it would be and though the user interface is really annoying it does make life very convenient and it sounds greatnote i have actually considered buying a newer rev of this with more disk space and a dial to facilitate scrolling through lists
they are available now with tons of space and are viable replacements for a shelf full of cds in your living spaceif the functionality has improved alongwith the disk sizeat last the  gig mp player finally showed upi dont care if the batteries last only four hours
usually  hours is enough and you can still buy more rechargeablesgot a fast internet connection
got napster imesh and found the ourmp site
then this jukebox will be worth every pennypros    gigs duh
fast upload
easy to usecons   rather heavy but it doesnt weigh more than my cd playerpanansonic with metal body
plastic body that scratches easilyfor people who has slow connection buy a cheap mp player instead because you will download for months until you obtain  gigs of musicat the end there are some features missing from what i expectedrandom selection and smaller body but  gigs no more cds no more cheap cd players woohooheres the deal
i bought an gb unit on another websiteupgraded with toshiba hard drive for shipped
ive owned the unit for nearly a month and ive got mostly positive comments thus far
storage capacity is excellent sound quality great easy to learn basic features highly portable ability to record voice and other data etcnegatives are its short battery life inability to scan through songs can only jump to the next track or start same song again and lack of shock protection smaller units use flash memory as opposed to a hard drive
also the unit will only play wav and mp formatin short if you need a storage device for your mps that is portable enough to take in a car or elsewhere but dont need an mp player to jog with then this product will surely work well
prices for these units continues to decline and i presume the newer units will solve many of the concerns of present unitslets start with the obvious from all the reviews
the bokeh is fine
the lens is pretty fast
f to f is useful as a creative range
the optics are sharp and the alltime focusing is a boon
so whats not to likewell heres the thing
the canod eosd which i use has the ability to use the viewfinder in live preview mode and when doing so will allow you to zoom in on your focus point or anywhere else but thats irrelevant to my point here such that you can see extremely fine detail
at which point you can manually focus the lens so that it is exactly right
marvelous rightit would be
but the lens has some mechanical backlash problems
let me explain backlash if youre not familiar with it it takes a bit of describingbacklash is a problem that occurs in gear trains or arrangements that causes the finest adjustments to repeatedly over or under adjust depending on which way you are going because the gears dont cant really fit perfectly togetherin a standard gear train the gear teeth have a little bit of freedom to move before they make contact with the teeth of the next gear in the gear train and this causes movement of the gear to be without resistancethe gear turns relatively easily because it isnt actually engaged and then when the teeth actually make contact a fraction of a turn later they slam together and more of an adjustment is made than one would expectwhich in turn requires adjusting the other way but now the gear has to move back across the nonengaged space and slams into the tooth behind in just the same manner
this can result in a very frustrating experienceso now we get to the issue with the lens
the focus adjustment has a noticeable backlash problem which becomes evident at the very highest magnification of the eos ds live previewi recently took a picture of a small creature about  thousandths of an inch across on the wall of my salt water aquarium
i used live preview max magnification and manual focuslet me tell you this was an experience of great disagreement between the lens and me
i spent literally ten minutes trying to get the lens to the best possible focusi would touch the lens ring and the focus would get sharper and then frustratingly slide right past that setting to slightly blurry again
id then adjust the other way and the same thing would happen again the other waythe camera was on a tripod it was orthogonal to the plane the object i was trying to focus on was attached to the object was agreeably motionless  all the recipe ingredients for an easy to focus situation
except we are talking about a very small object and so very fine focus control is requiredis this going to bother you in your application
probably not unless you shoot very tiny things as i do from time to time
even then were talking about trying to squeeze the very last wisps of focus accuracy the lens is capable of out of itbut after spending almost  on a lens would you not want to get all you can out of the optics
i know i do
if what youre shooting is moving you could easily lose the best possible shot because the focus is just about uncontrollable in that last percentile or soit is possible that i got a bad lens perhaps others would be so good to check this out before they post their reviews
but i have to review the lens i have because thats the experience ive hadi like this lens
its very sharp
my only complaint is the focusing on this lens tends to be slow at low light just low light not dark
the lens seems to search to much
i had the tamron mm  which is incredibly sharp but it had the same problem
i figured since the canon has usm that it would be faster at focusing even while hunting
i also have the canon    which has usm and is incredibly fast at focusing
it doesnt hunt as much as the mm but when it does it locks on much faster
i use a d with a canon efs  f which is incredibly fast focus and it hardly ever hunts so i dont think it is the camera
bear in mind i am not describing super dark situations just low lighti use this lens all the time and never get bored of finding things to photograph with it
it is really a good lens and you will often see people comment on the fact that it may be one of those special lens that could be l glass but gets away with being reasonably pricedbuild this is a solid well built lens
its mostly metal construction ensures that it will last a long time
the focus ring is of course rubber and is easy to use
however this lens is heavy so much so that if you are handholding it and using manual focus your camera holding hand will get tired
i have attempted to do this with a ex flash mounted on top and it is literally hand cramping after a while
you will most likely want to purchase a tripod collar with this lens as a lot of focus will be lost due to camera shakeaf this lens isnt the fastest lens on earth and in conjunction with an xti i find that it is sometimes annoyingly slow
it also tends to hunt a little in all but the best light conditions
another reason to get a lens collar and use a tripod
however i rarely use autofocus with macro work and prefer the control of manual
given the shallow depths of field manual is much more useful
also the only time you really need a fast af with macro is outside shooting bugs and such and you will probably have the light of the sun which would of course be plenty to ensure the af functions as you want it to
i wouldnt pass this lens up on account of the slightly slow afpicture quality i find that this lens produces incredibly sharp pictures again do not expect really sharp pictures hand held i feel like a lot of people complain about this but dont realize its their fault not the lens
the saturation and general color is amazing and i rarely find that i have to up the saturation or vibrance
personally i have found this lens to be tack sharp at f and it stays there most of the time as f is a very very shallow depth of fieldin comparison although i do not own the mm macro i have had a chance to use one and although the mm is more versatile ie portraits i would not give up the reach
even at mm i find myself wishing i had the mm l lens
but mm is certainly better than mm
this is definitely a macro lens if you also want to do portraits get the mm and the   personally this is a better choice than loosing the mmoverall amazing lens you will be satisfied if you are looking to do macro and some portraits if you have enough room outside
the only reason i give it four and not five stars is the slow af in darker lighting situations
but you can work around this
great lens from a great companythe canon ef mm f is a perfect lens for a narrow band of applications
for portaits and life size full picture of a small object it serves very well
however i found it difficult to give up the flexibility of my mm zoom lens
i dont carry a pack of lenses around so the versatility of the mm trumps most other characteristics most of the timedont get me wrong the mm is of excellent quality with no problems
it is capable of very sharp photos and is fun to use
some people say its too heavy
i dont think so
its weight and size dont bother me at all i use it on my xt
ive gotten some very sharp and interesting pictures using it
however wide angle capability and being able to compose pictures by including or excluding elements of the scene has spoiled me
i would have liked a little more zoom on the mm though
the net result is that i occasionally use this macro and very much enjoy it when i do
im happy with it and recommend it for portraits and closeups and even as a walk around lens provided you can compose the picture by walking where you need to bei purchased this lens primarily for use as a macro lens
since i shoot mostly wildlife including bugs i thought the field of view of mm used with my canon rebel xt would be just about ideal
in reality the fl was not enough
i had to approach the bugs much too close and they frequently left the scene quickly
the pictures taken with the lens were extremely sharp and the bocah out of focus area behind the subject was very nice
i wound up selling the lens on ebay since it didnt meet my needsi am an advanced amateur
i bought this canon lens to round out my array of lenses for my rebel xsi
i was interested in taking macro shots of bugs and other small objects plus have the capability of a portrait lens
i havent had it for very long and i havent taken a lot of pictures yet but it is impressive in its sharpness and accurate focusing
it focuses to  foot but you have to have a steady hand since it doesnt have is
construction is solid notice the weight and all focusing is internal so the barrel doesnt move in and out
this is a great feature for macro imagesi recommend it highly but if i had the extra money i would go for the canon mm macro lens with is
that is the only reason i gave it a  ratingif you want to jump into macro photography without making your banker angry and making compromise in image quality this lens is the perfect choice here is why almost half the price of the is version and even more if you get a nice used one very good image quality l rated nice build quality a joy to use the very large focusing ring pretty good for portrait tooa couple of things dont think about doing macro photography without flash
im personally using a ex ii  pocketwizard prefer closeup lens like the canon d than extension tubes because they are much more easier to use no need to get the lens out of the body and you dont loose any lightif you need real world samples just check my website and blogemmanueli was looking for a lens to eliminate the need for extension tubes
while i dont think this will totally eliminate using them it is looking pretty good for eliminating them most of the time
the brokeh is excellent
i posted  quick shots to represent the quality of the image
i was also surprised by the heft of this lens
you definitely know it is on the camera body using an eos ti and for shots that take time to get just right you will probably want to use a mono or tripod as the weight of the lens will affect shots that take any amount of time to set
make sure to use the distance setting on the side of the lens next to the af setting as this will speed focusing on longer range shotsive used this and the  f l series macro and this is as sharp under most circumstances at half the cost
the l series offers image stabilization is and while i dont see that as a macro issue these lenses are great for portraiture and general use
so if you plan to do that sort of thing and are not always on a tripod and especially if you love sunset landscapes or candid portraits the is might throw you to the l series
if not this is your lensi bought this lens after going through many reviews and mainly used this with my canon rebel xt this lens is very goodthough its a macro lens i have used this for portrait photos and it works like a charm
i have yet to test this on my new canon ti
i am sure this lens will give me better pictures with the new camerai am using this camera for past one yearyou can check my sample picturesthis lens is well worth the moneyconsdont come with a camera hood not weather sealed  if i can afford a weather sealed camera in future  i no longer own this lens  i have replaced it with canons ef m macrooptically this is an excellent lens the focus speed is very good better than the mm  it is quite light and easy to hand hold
it also makes a very nice general purpose short telephotohowever for small shy creatures it lacks sufficient stand off distance resulting in missed opportunities  it also is not compatible with canons teleconvertersmy biggest issue with this lens was the optional tripod ring  it comes with a plastic sleeve that fits around the lens to which the tripod ring attaches  i found this system inefficient  it was stiff in operation and fragile
as most of my macro photography is shot from a tripod this was a big issuei am working on some close up scientific photography so i use the  mm macro lens almost exclusively
it allows exquisite close up photography that is finally
in focus at most points of my three dimensional subjects
this camera and this lens are a blessing and i couldnt complete my project in a high quality manner without themthis is a great lens
the only reason i gave it  stars is because i wish i would have purchased it with image stabilization
being so long  heavy there is quite a bit of camera shake when handheld
but if you dont have the extra  to spend then its a great piece of equipment
there should be no issues with using it on a tripodi felt that this lens necessiate is and without it its mostly unusable due to the percentage of blurry shots you get
that is because at mm you need a shutter speed of at least  for mostly blurfree shot
so i look at the is l version of this lens but that was out of my budget
i then came across efs mmf lens and realized it will require only a  shutter with no is and could deliver steady shots so i purchased that lens and am much happier
the  actually gives you same optical quality as the   it is superb both for macros and for portraits espacially if you have an external flash
consider getting the  if you have a cropbody camera over this lens
for fullframe users if you are using a tripod then this lens definitely works over more expensive l version otherwise the fl is will be a better option over this
though if you are serious in macro photography the mm macro is best and for portraits you got lots of other options including the excellent 
but if you want both a macro and a portrait lens for your ff this is pretty goodi have to say that this lens is maybe the most fun lens in my bag
its tack sharp with good color and contrast
i use this quite often with thecanon mrex macro ring lite for canon digital slr camerasand results are flawless
ive also used it for onthespot portraits and with a great f max aperture the bokeh was beautiful
the only reason i gave it  instead of  stars is canons continued refusal to provide a lens hood with their nonl lenses
i bought thecanon et lens hood for canon ef mm f macro usm lensseparately which was pretty pricy but makes a big enough difference in sunny conditions to be a must have itemupdate   this lens is one of the most fun lenses i own but now thecanon ef mm fl is usm to macro lens for canon digital slr camerasis out and since i do a large amount of macro work the is is a must have
the new lens has got nothing but good reviews so ive sold this lens to a friend to pay part of the bill for the new onei was agonizing between this lens and the canon efs mm f macro usm
basically the reviews and specifications are similar
the  mm lens is ef while the  mm lens is efs so the  mm lens is compatible with full frame cameras
however most people willing to invest in a full frame camera are probably considering the  mm l lens
my thoughts on comparing the two lenses
price is similar with the  mm being  less only
 mm lens weighs half as much
both get  stars with around  reviews on amazon
magnification is the same on both 
you can stay a bit further from your subject with the  mm lens at max magnification  ft rather than  inchesanyway i was unable to decide between the two and i saw that the  mm lens was available from amazon
i decided to testdrive it and keep it if i was happy
my thoughts
the lens didnt seem that extraordinary on my camera but i was extremely pleased with the results once i looked at them on a big screen
its sharp and the colors are beautiful
i thought id rather have a  mm lens than a  mm lens since i already have a  mm lens
however i think  mm is a rather awkward focal length on the nonfull frame camera
its not long enough to take much in the way of animals and birds but its often too long to take pictures of pets or people youre with
for things in macro it doesnt make much difference since youre going to be so close to the subject either way
the lens felt very heavy on the camera given that its a fixed lensfor me the main argument for the  mm over the  mm was that i had a  mm lens already and i thought it would be great to have another fixed lens at a different focal length
the main argument for the  mm lens was the weight
after using the lens i think the  mm is probably a better choice for nonfull frame usersi love this lens
its great fun to have the special tool you need when you want to work really closei like this focal length in a macro and i like the aperture
i wish the l series macro were not mm because i want a shorter macro
but canon those cads dont make a short macro in a l series lens
so i had to buy some plastic
oh well
its fine i guess
but not as sensual as my silky smooth l lenses
as a matter of fact i am kind of embarrassed by its lack of a red ring and plastickyness
but it works ok and someday i pray canon will make me a nice l series honest to god metal macro in a shorter focal length
like mm and f ok canon godsi wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get im so glad i did
with the smaller sensor on my d the mm is more like mm or so so its a nice  wideopen telephotoportrait lens as well
ive uploaded a few photos ive taken w this lens to show what its capable of in macro and telephoto
i thought the mmmm is usm lens that came e my camera was sharp  but compared to this lens the kit lens might as well be from a diy pinhole cameramy less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses
when im trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower there is a lot of shake
i cant practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud so i have to take  shots to get one thats not shake blur  and i miss some really cool shotsin addition to the lack of image stabilization i am frustrated w the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro
i wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only so it wouldnt be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the timeive taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro
the telephoto focal length is a bit long for those of us who cannot afford a fullframe sensor camera for most casual photography
i recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery
i practically had to set up in the restaurants bathroom to get the photos i wanted but opted for this lens because its much faster  and i wanted to use natural light over flashthe lens is long and heavy for its range
with the addition of the battery pack grip this lens added on is very weighty so i may not take it w me in my kit bag on every shoot
once i add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasionsits tacksharp but it can be frustrating at timesi bought this lens along with a couple of other canon prosumer zooms several years ago when i switched from nikon to canon slrs
i hadnt used it much until i recently rediscovered how useful it issee i have the venerable l
that lens is truly outstanding
i use it a lot with the canon ef x extender which makes the  into a  f zoom
when i got the  i pretty much stopped using the i recently realized that i carry the  around more than i actually use it
my most used lenses are in the normal to wide range unless i have a special purpose in mind that requires a longer focal length lens
but sometimes opprotunity presents the need for a long lens when you least expect it and even though i was never a boy scout i do like being prepared
the  is smaller and lighter than the l
its a pretty sharp lens if you recognize its limitations
limitations include being a notch or two down in sharpness at the mm end of the zoom range unless you stop it down to around f
at mm or shorter it performs well even at maximum aperture even though its not up to lseries optical qualityits not lseries quality in build either
it has a plastic barrel and the manual focusing ring was an afterthought
it grows in physical size when zoomed to the longer focal lengths
it sucks in dust by doing this i have lots of speckles inside my lens to show thisbut they have no affect on image quality
it also has an annoying tendency to zoom itself back and forth by its own weight
i carry a large rubber band around to keep this from happening if for some reason i use the lens on a tripod and tilt it up or downi like this lens more today than i did when i first bought it despite the fact that the  is a much better lens on all frontsi ordered this lens after reading mixed reviews of it but i was really pleasantly surprisedit focusses reasonably fast and the pictures i have taken of bugs squirrels kids playing and still objects were all sharp with nice color
i cant wait to try it at the zooit is best in bright sunlight and about f which i expected but what i did not expect was that it is surprisingly good at mm wide open too
also the is is a musthave for me
it enables me to handhold shots at mm which i would normally not be able to do and get sharp picsall in all i would highly recommend this lens to anyone who wants good telephoto pictures and doesnt have  or so to get these same features in an quotlquot lensowned  weeksthe only thing to cause me to stop short of  stars is the weight of the lens
stabilization is great and worth every dime
dont even think about the other mm nonis version it is junk  i tried it
you can hand hold this lens at  mm at 
no kidding
focus is fast and accurate with my digital rebel  almost no hunting like on the other mm
you must get a skylight filter to protect the front elementill update this review after a few months usei honestly felt compelled to write this after reading many of the other reviews
it seems that everyone out there rating the product high has quotjust got it this morningquot and everyone else seems to be complaining about repairs and suchwell my case is different
i bought my nomad ii mg a little over a year ago along with a friend of mine
we got them at the same time from the same store and with an extra mb total mbi use the unit every day while going to and from the office at least  hours a day
in my experience the battery will not last more than  hours they say 
having said that i have not had to replace the batterylet me get the bad out of the way first the buttons are extremely sensitive
after a while i wound up locking up the unit and just let it run on random random logic seems quotnot so randomquot controls are not intuitive and take some getting used to smartmedia card will sometimes stop working
shutdown remove and replace usually solves this the headphones are horrible
extremely uncomfortable
i wound up buying sony phonotopia there was a shutdown problem while docked which was solved when i upgraded firmwareif after reading the previous list you think i hate this unit think again  i love itthis unit is extremely light small and portable
you can carry it in a shirt pocket
easy to carry in any seasonif you get the mb total you have an average  hours of music to go along with you
got tired of the same music
switch to the fm tuner and youre good to go
or switch to kbps sampling rate and cram more songs inthis unit has great sound
i also found it to be loud enough for my taste
i always use sound level at   maxfor the record the sync software is very easy to usemy friend has had the same experience with this mp player as i have
were both very happy with it and i would buy it again in a heartbeatan excellent player overall
the quality is good and the download time is really short
the software is very easy to use
the fm radio and voice recorder is a plus however i dont find myself using the voice recorder much
there are some shortcomings however
the plastic on the docking station feels flimsy and cheap i was expecting better quality such as the sony clie
also all the buttons have the same shape and it is hard to find the one you want in the dark
i think creative could have preserved the style of the unit and still made the buttons different shapes
the headphones are cheap and uncomfortable i reccoment a pair of sony wear
and finally to operate the unit you have to take the player out of the quotleatherquot case
they should have just made slots on the sides so you can access the buttonsthe card worked great but the software included for capture stunk
i think its the same with all cards they always give you the  software for free
in this case it was the ulead video studio software but the se version not the good stuffbut as for the card i just put it in booted back to windows xp it detectd the card and away i went
i didnt even need to give it my driver cdsince it included a firewire cable i didnt have to purchase one eitherthis worked great for me on all windows based systems i have used it with many hp printers without any driver conflicts
i have also used it with all my upgrades win  winxp without any problemsit is fully configable with all the settings i have needed dhcp static ip smtp daisy chaining ect  and i like to try all the settings
if you are printing to different printers from any number of computers in a tcpip network or windows domain this is for youit was a little slow on the large print jobs
someone in a  large printing enviroment should look to something with some built in memory
it also does appletalk netbui and ipxspx
i will be trying the bidirectional scanners stuff very soonadded  i later found that the cigarette lighter socket on my car could not supply much power so it was not the fault of the linksys inverter that it did not perform well in my caroriginal review this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite a laptop
it cycled on and off every  seconds
it powered a  watt lamp okay but wouldnt start a  watt heat lamp at all
product spec sheet says it can supply  watt surge and  watts for  min and is rated at  watts continuous
my laptop power supply is rated at a input at  vac and if it drew a constantly i agree that it would need  to  watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter
however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for  min but only manages  sec
in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full  amps continuously
i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did
it did not work for me
maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs  watts but i wouldnt recommend it for more than thatcorrected conclusion  the fact that this inverter couldnt power my laptop was probably due to a fault in my cars wiring to the lighter plug and not the fault of the inverter
i amended the review in  and with this further amendment i have changed the star rating to  out of   maybe i should have given it  stars because i didnt really give it a fair test before returning it for a refund
the useful conclusion in this review is that if an inverter doesnt seem to carry the load it is rated for maybe you should check to see if you are getting a full v in to the inverter when under loadi hate those little dongle things that most laptop ethernet cards have so this is a good sollution
linksys makes good enough cards for most people and i like this better than the dongle
however com and xircom both do a much better job with the quotdonglelessquot laptop cards however they cost significantly more
if cost is a factor and you hate the dongle this is a great sollution
if you can afford them the other cards work better and the connection part is more functional than this onei purchased these speakers for  back in  and they are still going strong
i have not have any problems with them except for the fact that that the knobs for the bass and treble controls have fallen off
the controls still work however but they are a bit harder to turn because the controls are harder to gripwhen i got these speakers they were one of the best for that price range
of course this is no longer the case but for me i find these speakers more than adequate
the clarity in these speakers is very good however you will hear some distortion if you have them on full blast with the bass turned all the way up
keep the speakers at a sensible level and you will soon discover that they are loud and powerful and clear at the same time
even without the subwoofer the sattelite speakers can also be viewed as very good speakers despite their small sizefor the  i spent for these speakers new i am sure i can get a much better speaker set these days however i really do not have the need to
the last speaker set i bought was from walmart those things did not last over  months it has been  years since i bought these and they still work like new
as long as they hold up i will hold off in upgrading them
eventhough i am pretty sure you can find these speakers even cheaper the  amazon has these listed at is still well worth the pricei used atp for  years
adquate volume fair sound for this price range nothing to complaintyour desk is the key for your sound performance
mid range drivers are located beneath the speaker stands
music reflects from your desk
sound quality mainly depends on the desk material
best performance achieved when you put them on hard wooden surfaces
avoid metal desksput the subwoofer near a corner or under your desk
this is very important
sound quality will improve lotsthe alteclansing atp speaker set with subwoofer accomplishes what it sets out to do
setup is a snap between the subwoofer and satellite speakers
the satellite also has the volume control as well as treble and bass controls
as for the sound the treble and bass control radically effects the quality of the sound with a very small rangefor settings that could be considered quotgoodquot for sound quality
they take up little space on the desktop and the subwoofer puts out nicely
all in all a good buyi agree with almost all of the good things you have probably already read about this camera so i wont repeat them
still there are a few areas where fuji really failed
the most annoying is that you cannot buy an adapter for mounting filters to the lens
when you pay this much for a camera with a good lens you should be able to protect it with an inexpensive clear filter
as it stands you have to buy an expensive macro adapter you may not need in order to get the filter ring
this seems like a customerunfriendly approachthe autofocus is very slow in all but the most ideal conditions
you cant capture an expression on someones face indoors even in a brightly lit room unless you go to manual focus
also battery life is too short especially when the spares they sell are expensive and have a lower capacity than the original equipmenti know this sounds very negative but in fact the camera is very good in other ways
i have taken some very nice pictures with it
just think carefully about what you want out of any digital camera before you buythis camera takes some really great pictures and videos but if you arent a computer whiz you better know someone that is to download the avi video files because neither the owners manual nor the software users guide mention anything relative to getting the avi videos on your hard drive to save theminstallation of the camera and viewer software is a breeze but after that your on your own to figure out saving videossomething that is not mentioned in advertising is that theres a warning in the owners manual about using it in the desertwhich is where i livelol
oh well we shall seeas far as picture quality and ease of use go the fuji finepix  is by far one of the best digital cameras you can buy
fuji probably discontinued this model though because the battery only lasts about  minutes to an hour if used with the lcd liquid crystal display
if you use the evf electronic view finder the battery will last longer the lcd just looks cooler is all
the software that comes with this camera is also very userfriendly and appears to be compatible with all oss
overall an excellent digital camera
extra batteries can be bought through the following web site
 i dont claim to be all that knowledgable about cameras films and photography but for the uninitiated this is as good a camera is you could possible need if youre anything like me
my  year old father whod not taken pictures in years picked up the basics pretty quickthe camera is old and a bit clunky for todays streamlined standards but for someone like me it makes it harder to drop and the photos are as good as newer models if not betterthe biggest grumble for me is the memory card
it takes smartmedia cards which are smaller memorywise and more expensiveive been using the finepix  for several months right now and i love the cameras features
i think the one big negative point about this model is the poor battery life
if you use the flash and the lcd display expect about  shots before you get the low battery indicator
i would recommend purchasing a second battery and charger for long tripsthe lcd viewfinder is another problem
the image you get from using the viewfinder isnt very clear in low light situations
my previous digital camera was the fuji mx which had an optical viewfinder
if you get a chance to compare an lcd viewfinder to an optical oneyou would agree that the optical works better
this also puts another strain on the battery life issue tooenough on the negatives
the best part about this camera is the image quality
its excellent and i love the x optical zoom
i would avoid using the digital zoom whenever possible
the lens on this model was the main reason for purchasing this camerathis camera has all of the adjustments a person could want
its very similar to my older slr cameras that use film only much less expensive to operate since the images are electronic
there are several automatic settings or the aperature can be set manually while leaving the speed automatic
the speed can be set while leaving the aperature on automatic or bot can be set manually
there are several levels of picture quality
you can have lots of pixels for high quality but fewer pics on the memory card or choose lower quality and more pics or somewhere inbetween
lots of flexibility
cons  the camera had a defect that causes it not to be able to connect to a computer
i had to buy a card reader separately which is a hassle but it works requites removing the memory card from the camera and connecting the reader to the computer
the battery is a special unit and doesnt last long but is ok for my needs
the memory cards are of an older design and dont have anywhere the capacity of the cards the newer cameras use
the bottom line  i got a very flexible camera for far less that the price of a new electronic slr
the picture quality and flexibility are excellent
the seller could have been more open about its uploading problemif you thought chungs review was late mine is much later just got this camera off ebay for  seller said the batteries only lasted  mins and included two spare np  batteries the wide angle lens and adapter and a nice case for 
i found out the battery problem was the cameras auto shutoff setting after  mins
im not saying the batteries last a long time far from it and as everybody has stated get an extra one as they warning light did start blinking after about  shots
took some amazing shot using macro and flash together
good camera if you can get a package deal like i did along with some smartmedia cards with it too too expensive to buy alonei had the chance to borrow this camera and use it for a couple days
the camera is easy to operate looks nice and produces pretty good results
this camera is proof that for x prints a  megapixel ccd is sufficientbut i wouldnt go any bigger than that
x is really the limit with  megapixels
its easy to connect to the computer and download images
the x zoom is sweet
after using this camera and going back to another camera with only a x zoom i felt deprived
and its image stabilized
however there are a few things that really bothered me about this cameraa fastest shutter speed is  of a second in nonautomatic modes
thats not very fast
if youre trying to capture fast moving objects forget about it
your picture will be a blur especially if youre using that x zoomb
the purple fringing aka chromatic aberration you see on digital cameras sometimes is pretty bad on this camera
from what ive been told this is common on olympus camerasc
i dont like how the onoffresetsettings selections are all on the same switch
it is way too easy to accidently push the switch up too far to the resetsettings selection and wipe out all the custom settings youve made
olympus really shouldve made this a seperate switchoverall i liked the results but i decided not to buy this camera due to the faults i listed
if olympus makes another camera like this with what i listed fixed and hopefully with a  megapixel chip as well ill be the first to buy itthis is a good camera for infrared photographyjust get yourself a mm infrared or red filter and have at itabout the only thing i didnt care for was the reset option on the onoff switch dont know why they did that
nice glass real nicea good cable for a reasonable price
you can spend more on cables but this will get the job done
so far no problems at all with this oneits a good cable nothing really all that special about it
my brother uses it when he practices bass so it gets the job donethis speaker wire must have been designed for a particular purpose but im not sure what the exact purpose is
it is wide but there is extra insulator between the two wires so it is not thin enough to put against a wall or under a rug flat ribbon wire would be needed for that
the width makes it difficult to turn some corners and remain flat so it could fold along the vertical seam of a wall but not stay flat on a ceiling around a corner
thin nails can be placed through the wide center insulator and it needs nailing at frequent intervals if you want it to stay flat stretched horizontally on a vertical surface
and the wire has so many strands like hair it is impossible to twist without flaring at the end maybe it needs to be tinnedi used about  ft for my project which was outdoors but mostly not exposed to uv
i couldnt find any information about suitability for outdoor use probably not uv resistant
there is still an enormous heavy spool on the shelf in the garage for future projects
if you measure a wiring project beforehand and only buy enough wire you will always be  feet short so there is a temptation to buy extra
so you buy extra and in this case your heirs will have to figure a use for iti think this wire was priced much lower in the past not sure it is such a bargain nowthis is nice speaker wire however it is thick flat and wide and much thicker and heavier than the speaker wire i am used to and for me it was oddly shaped
the wire itself has the consistency more like hair than wire making it hard to push through the holes in the speakers
it works nicely and its a great price for the amount of wire you get
i must not have read something correctly because i was really surprised at the sheer bulk of the wire itself feet of speaker wire is a really really large amount of speaker wire
it seemed like a good idea when i ordered it
less so when i lugged the nearly demolished box off my front porch where some poor ups driver had to drag it from his truck
ive wired up my living room and barely made a dent in this beast
do the math before you decide that you need  feet of speaker wire
i wish i hadneeded better protection than my  surge protector for my ht setup now that i have a couple dvrs  a plasma
filtering would be a nice side benefit too
very little  more than the powerstrip design units i was looking at  now i see it dropped even lower
pros build quality fit  finish plenty of outlets  diversity of outlets for me nice formfactor compared to powerstrip design cool looking leds  metercons those cool looking leds cannot be dimmed  are too bright esp the blue one
if facing ht viewers
i just blocked the leds wa black card
cablesat cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider cablevision caused more artifacts on hd channels so couldnt use the cable line filterbottom line seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing  amazoni have only used this power filter and the montster power hts but i can notice a difference between the two in my home theatre and audio system
i upgraded from the hts to the hts to help get rid of the pop i would sometimes see on the screen or hear in my music due to a large appliance in my apartment complex
this device has done more than just get rid of that but it has really enhanced my digital products dvd and cd with its special filter sections
my cd player sounds more focused and the ocassions i hear any quotdigital jitterquot are far less
besides enhancing my system in that way it is a great looking unit and goes well with my system
i feel however that the leds are two bright and the outlets should have a selection to be switched or unswitched
besides that a great unit
if you dont own any type of power filter get one
they are so much more than just surge suppressorsthe experiences for people with product like this is all over the place because it will depend on the environment that one puts it in
this is an electrical product with capability to filter out electrical noises and power surge protect the equipments that connect to it
there is no magic here pure sciences
it will do the most good in the worst electric environment like apartment or small home with few independent cicuits
if one have a microwave or vacuum cleaner running on the same circuit it works great but it does not work as much mafic if there are no other power hungry appliances connect to the same circuit
having said that i would say that it is still a good investment for the thousands of dollars i put into the home theater system
the surge protection ability is better than anything less than  as it have protected my equipments from numerous thunderstorms and even a couple close lightning strikes over the years and it still works
it is also convenient to have the power outlets within the rack so one does not have all the wire running out of the back
i can honestly says that it probably  improves video quality some with clean ac power to the dvd playerreceiver and the hd tv picture is cleaner and definitely less prone to power noises and voltage fluctuations
the audio quality coming out of my yahama av system if definitely better with less hisses and pops from the power noises and the power sub thumps nicely with no hums
the front panel also match the rest of the rack and the analog power meter is a nice touch
the led could get a bit bright for home theater viewing but some electric tape will fix that or put it aside away from the tv screen
for a little over  including shipping it is a bargain for meused these to swap out the spade lugs which were incompatible with my sons onkyo tx
kudos to monster for allowing me to reuse  year old cables
better for the environment and my walleti had not problems installing and using this unit
i am running thicker speaker wire  gauge and had not problems getting it to stay
the terminals could be a little beefier but it works fine
now i can control my speakers separatelyi picked this up when i ordered a nad integrated amp with only one set of speaker outputs
i currently have  pairs running but plan on another pair for the master bath and ill be set since this monster set can run  pairsthe unit came pretty fast and upon inspection i could see that it was built to a lower price point than what is typical for monster but thats not a bad thing as much of their gear can be quite pricey
the speaker inputs on back are not designed for anything bigger than  gauge and the manual suggests using gold pin connectors on wire larger than that
currently you can get a set of  pairs of monster gold angled pin connectors for  bucks on amazon but dont get banana plugs they dont fit
i started by making sure my amp was indeed off
never make any connections with your gear on it can damage sensitive circuits
upon inserting my  gauge wire i found it a tight fit but by twisting or rotating the wire as i pushed it in it was fine with no loose strands
loose strands can cause a short if long enough clip any you see and take your time on this you are not in a race and doing it carefully will give you years of servicemonster could have used bigger or better speaker connectors here small spring clips are not exactly the best
but its a small unit and to accommodate big  way binding posts would have required a much bigger back plate which would mean a much bigger case all around
more expensive to build so im fine with the size and the price some may not beso after making all the connections i tested it out and have been very happy with the sound
it has circuitry that a connects multiple pairs of speakers to your amp in parallel and b adds some form of resistance to each channel to maintain  ohms for your amp as  ohms would be dangerous for most amps or receivers
i wondered if this monster model would change or color the sound when it added load but the sound remained untouched albeit with slightly less volume easily compensated for
for running a single pair you disengage the circuitry by pushing a button and  or more pairs requires you to depress said button to engage this circuitry
pretty easy way to protect your gear ive been just leaving the protection circuitry on as there are no issues this wayfor the money this model is an excellent option to run speakers in different rooms or zonesfairly easy to hook up to speaker wires
allows one amp to drive up to  sets of stereo speakers without blowing the amp
provides very good sound quality to all speakers
however from the cant get something for nothing department there is a marked volume drop across all speakers as each pair is brought online
further it would be nice if there were separate volume controls for each pair
my set up includes two sets of outdoor hidden rock speakers around our pool a set of outdoor speakers near our bbq and a set inside our living room
all are driven adequately with my yamaha watt amp cranked up to max
it would be nice to be able to turn down the living room whilst keeping the bbq cranked
anyway fine quality product good price just may not do everythingthis multi zone switch is a solid easy to set up easy to use switch
they may be a little pricey but you pay for qualityfor noncritical multiroom single zone audio these get the job done and are priced righti installed two of these in a home where the previous owner took the amp and switches when they sold
the existing volume controls were nonimpedance matching and i didnt perform any measurements but two of these switches with  pairs of speakers enabled presented a manageable load to the wpc  channel amp allowing hours of continuous use without forcing the amp into thermal shut downi should also point out to others that these are impedance matching not volume matching they average out the electrical load placed on the amplifier
this is important because if you have different speakers with different sensitivities dblwm you will end up with different apparent audio levels in different rooms i should have thought to explain that to this customer before handpurchased the monster cable ss speaker switcher to turn off and on my different speakers
it does a good job and allows you to turn speakers off in one area of the home and on in another
if you have thicker gauge speaker wire you will need some type of adapter on the ends of the wire
there are simple spring clips on the back of the unit that can accommodate normal speaker wire
the unit is not powered so dont expect it to provide a boost to your speakers
it is a good basic speaker switcheras i listen to the digital crispness of big country i wonder how i enjoyed digital music without an innovative mp player such as the hipzip
here is how i feel about this wonderful deviceplustransfer speed  quick transfer of files
less than  minutes to transfer  songssimple  instantly recognized in windows xp as a hipzip and i was up and running in seconds
easy menu navigationvalue  with recent price cut and cheap media this is a great mp player to take digital music portablequality  solid construction  year warranty on mediasize  dimensions are perfect for me
not tiny but it is half the size of my portable cd player and fits great in my handcase  excellent case not a cheap throw insound  great sound quality surpassing my cd player with wma files and new headphones see belowflexibility  plays mpswmasaudible content and is upgradeable
i have been using wmas myself due to the excellent sound and better compression
i can get over an hour and half on one pocketzip with wmarechargeable  charges in  hours and lasts over  hoursantiskip  it will not skip and in fact passed my quotmow the lawnquot test and jogging test
reason for no skip is simple
it caches songs in mb of internal memory

moving parts wear outobsolete
 rumors of a nonbackwards compatible mb hipzip and equally rumors of iomega dropping hipzip altogether to cut costs
buy all the media you need just in casedisplay  good info and layout but very light and pixels in background obsure display
hard to discern shading and iconsreal minus
cost the th starheadphones  included labtec headphones are painful on the ear and sound awful
extremely tinny with no bass at all
replaced with only a  set of phillips headphones and the difference was night and day
shame cuz the sound from this player is wonderfulive also got a creative nomad and the hipzip player is better
ive been eyeing another product for a while but the price on the hipzip pretty much blew that out of the water pros the hipzip has fairly inexpensive media the display is easy to read and shows everything you need at once well organized button placement ease of swapping media ease of transferring files of any type to media does not store the os on the media so you can fill it completely full compatability with other clikpocketzip drives longer battery life the software is minimal and painless iomegas sw is allinone it came with an ac adaptor not a separate cradle and you can get the car adaptor for only  from iomega which is great for road tripsconswishlist i really miss the radio from my nomad since the display is so large it should have a clock it could probably be a little smaller the mb size of each disk is a bit limiting but ive read that the pocketzip disks will be available in mb some time this year anyone else heard this
some people have complained of the noise it makes the same whirandclick noise that my old zip drive made but its not nearly as loud
if youre listening to music with the headphones you wouldnt really hear it unless you had the player right up to your ear
it also has some memory built in as a buffer
i havent been able to find out how much but it will read the disk and throw it into the buffer so it isnt constantly reading the diskafter i wrote my first review and  days after i bought it i accidentally dropped my iomega hipzip onto a cement floor from a height of about five feet
it struck right where the purple lid opening contacts with the metal case
it rendered it useless
it no longer registered when disks were in it and it emitted all sorts of whirring clicking noises trying to find them
i figured the warranty was as void as i could possibly get for such carelessness but i contacted iomega anyway
even after i told them twice that i had dropped it they swung into action faxed me out some forms told me where to send my unit and oila what looks eerily like a brand new replacement unit arrived on my doorstep just five days later
it certainly wasnt the same unit i sent them as it was missing an obvious scratch i had added
now thats aftersales customer support you cant beat anywhere
for this alone i have to give the unit an extra star
had i dropped any other brand id be looking mournfully at a pile of expensive junk with no recoursenb the unit was replaced through the southeast asiaaustralasiasydney branch of iomega but i am assuming that this company philosophy translates elsewhere
as customers i think we should support companies like this which do the right thing  and more  for consumers instead of always being solely after the almighty buckiomega is a name i trust
ive had zip drives since before there was dirt and have never had a minutes grief with any of them
nevertheless i did debate about buying this item because i wasnt sure i needed it
still im a gadget geek so i went ahead and ordered it
and what i found was that i probably didnt really need it but i do kind of like iti love the idea of swappable media
unfortunately the disks only hold about  minutes worth of music which is okay theyre tiny
i can carry several days worth of tunes in my pockets
i really wanted it for audible content audio books for those of you who arent familiar with audiblecom and herein lies the biggest drawback of all hipzip firmware only supports audible formats  and  these are less compressed than format  and thus bigger
this is a problem for me for two reasons
first if i want to buy anything that weighs in at over  megs slightly less each disk has some operating fribble on it i cant write it to a disk
this would be any unabridged novel and quite a few abridged onessecond and perhaps more annoying audible doesnt make all its content available in all formats
the bulk of what ive already downloaded is only available as format  files which means i only listen to the content on my computer
i dont want to turn this into a rant against audible or iomega but it seems to me that neither position is easily defensible and the loser is anyone who thinks that the hipzip is going to allow them to go portable with the greater part of audibles contentthat said i have to say that this is one of the best audio players ive ever used
the swapable media puts it way out ahead to begin with but its also easier to use than either my rave or my rio
it comes with a rechargeable battery the conservationist in me loves this the audio fanatic is annoyed at having to stop and recharge for  hours when it runs out and light secure headphones
the screen could be easier to read  its a bit dark  but its not bad
the package comes with two rewriteable disks which gives you  megs of storage and additional disks arent horribly expensive
and the sound
very goodall things considered id say that if you like the idea of small lightweight swappable media over expensive ram upgrades this is a great unitoccasionally bits of memory mysteriously disappears
for example of my daily mileage tabs for the past six months novembers mileage records have inexplicably vanished though this months december  mileage records are intact
this happened to me a while back with septembers mileage records but they inexplicably reappeared a few weeks later
im hoping the same will happen to the missing november recordsthis is my first pda so have no idea if this is just a fact of life with all pdas or whatother than that this pda is more than enough for my needs no need to blow  for some fancy schmancy fullcolor  mhz same as an old pentium ii desktop
hp or sony running pocket windows which is actually not as easy to use as palm osi used to own a palm v but sold it because it didnt have enough memory
i only had enough money to buy this platinum so i didpros fast during use and usb syncronization is greatcons clunky big and fati also got this because it is compatible with the omnisky wireless service
there are other visors out there with mb ram but no compatability with omniskyif there is a way for handspring to deliver a platinum in a palm v form factor that would be greati dont mind there not being a rechargeable solution to the platinum because i often go on trips and when i had the palm v the batteries would run down
i certainly did not lug around the charger for the palm v so i was out of luck when battery power was out
now on trips all i do is pack a few aaas and im finemy rd trip into the facinating world of personal digital devices
my st was a dismal failure i dont want to go into it for fear i may weep onto my keyboard  again my nd was my palm m and now my visor platinum
at first i figured just by the looks of it this was going to be my pda of choice  but after the initial surprise i was given this device by a friend for my birthday i found that yes this is a very good product but is it better than my m
nope
they cost roughly the same have mb of memoryboth are upgradablefastbut for my personal tastes the ms smaller size was actually a better selling point for me
plus it has palm os  a small but significant improvement over the visor
sure the screen is smaller some would say too much but for me this is in no way a problem
the screen is crisp and very sharp and i havent had a problem with viewing it in different lighting conditions
the basic advantage for me anyway of the m over the platinum is it sits more comfortably in my hands and its smaller size makes it easier to carry and usenot to mention the multiple faceplates that palm offers as well as other accessories hands down i find myself using it more than my visorokay enough of the downside
if size is a problem for you then maybe the platinum could be your next handheld
personally id go with the less expensive visor deluxe which does basically everything the platinum does but for about  cheaper
but again that is up to you
if you are already familiar with a palm device getting used to pretty much any visor product will be a walk down the same pathway for the most part anyway
they both use the exact same graffiti script and with small exceptions set up virtually identicala quick note handspring plans to slowly but surely cut back on their production of pdas and begin to market cellphonepdas as they work to become a communications company
they will be introducing their treo phonepda any day now if not already and they are nifty items but again the cost is prohibitive for now anyway for many folks who just cannot afford to have a in product such as this
personally ive found that my cell phones wear out the more often i use it and if i handle my cell phone as much as i handle my pda i simply cannot see it paying off in the end but that is just my opinion
i feel the more you know the easier it is to make a decisionand when it comes to pdas and what is availble versus the cost the more information you have the better
good lucki bought a platinum after not having a palm device for years
i wanted to see what i was missing and see how far they had all come
the platinum was a nobrainer when comparing price with the palmbranded products
i thought i would give handspring a chance
well i can say i am overall very happy with the unit
the hardware is well made and is sturdy
the buttons feel good
the screen is crisp and overall the processor is very fast
although i wasnt sure if i would quotget intoquot iti find myself using it quite regularly
usb support is awesome and syncing is very fast
updated datebook software is also very useful
the backup springboard module is a requirement and a great addition
my only complaint regarding the unit itself is the backlight
the backlight on other palm devices is great and can be used in a lighted room
the backlight on various other electronic gear i have is also very good
the backlight on the visor is useless except in nearcomplete darkness
if you are in a dimly lit room and think the backlight might help think again
it really does nothing more than make it worse
hackmaster quothacksquot to reverse the backlight dont help the situation
although i wouldnt trade my visor i wish that the backlight could be repaired
other than that i would recommend the unit to anyone looking for a wellmade expandable handheld computer
i will buy another handspringthis is the cream of the crop for greyscale palmos organizers
runs all of your palm  apps can add a cellphone module or wireless network module to be connected on the go
 megs of ram is good for everything except carrying a library or alot of avantgo offline web
id highly recommend this to most people however if the extra  mhz isnt important save your cash and get a palmiiixe with  megs of ram flashupgradable os handspring os is in rom to save costs and is much cheaper pricewatch listings around nandecent battery life easy to read except in direct sunlight and a fast usb hot sync
what more could you ask for
well if i were asking i would like a speaker that was a bit louder and an mb flash backup capability
i love the springboard slot my two favorites the omniremote control anyones tv
and the innovision v mb flash backup  vibrating alertthe color capability lets me put all of my wallet quotsnapshotsquot into my hand now
this is possible with the number of colors you can display at once not so on the palm iiic and i can easily download maps into the unit for later retrieval when im losti also insist on rechargable batteries i hate replacing batteries but i did manage to run out of juice when i had several alerts and didnt recharge for  weekslove the calculator its actually useful vis a vis the palm standard one and datebook is an improvement as well
every traveller should have onei love my prism and use it constantly
its great for games and reading on the road
it does have some minor problems though in direct sunlight the screen appears black making it difficultimpossible to use the darned thing is bulky as all getout it doesnt work with any other handspring products except the styli and the cartridges so youve got to have special cradles chargers cases etc
and you cant use keyboards poor battery life
dont plan on using this thing all the way through a trip
buy a car charger customer support is awful
i seriously think they were trying to scam me out of some money
they actually did get some out of me so that i could replace one immediately so that i could get something approaching a real battery life
otherwise id have been pdaless for several weeksas far as palmos compatible organizers nothing beats this one
 megs of ram color screen upgrade slot palmos   the only drawbacks are that the os is in rom rather than eeprom aka flash and the battery life even with the hardwired lithiumion battery is one quarter of any of the greyscale organizersif you need color and keep it charged and dont mind a rom os then this is the one for youthe only organizer better than this excluding the windowsce jobs which are really palmtop computers not pdas is the agenda
agenda developer model is m ram m rom strongarm cpu pda software reads palm data and it runs stronarm linux
its cheaper than any of the other pdas on the market and great for the hackertypei went to a handspring prism after my palm m actually two of them stopped hotsynching
although it performs well and i really like the color display there are two major drawbacks
first it is too bulky
i thought this would not be a problem for me but unlike my palm i find myself somewhat bothered by the fact that it wont fit into my shirt pocket
second the display washes out in sunlight and is difficult almost impossible to seethe visor series is advertised as being infinitely expandable and it is
the problem is that while there are currently more expansion options for visor than for palm those options come at a rather steep price
furthermore prospective buyers should also be aware that handspring intends to get out of the personal digital assistant pda market and concentrate on communicators such as its new treo series
this might dry up the expansion device market and make the modules even more expensive than they currently areif you know what youre getting into the prism isnt a bad pda
personally i think the visor pro is a much better deal for the money
although it doesnt have a color display it does feature mb of memory to the prisms mb as well as a slightly thinner case and costs about the same when you factor in the  instant rebate currently being offered by handspringafter owning the visor platinum for several months i finally upgraded to the visor prism
the visor prism has advantages over all other handspring visors in which it has the very nice color screen and built in lithium ion rechargeable batteriesthe disadvantage to this unit is the flickering back light on the screen
once or twice every minute or so the backlight will flicker
the flicker may bother some of youor most of you
this is the major reason why i cant give this unit  starsthe other disadvantagenot major is the thickness of the unit
it is several millimeters thicker in some areas and the springport slot is a little farther back than the deluxe or platinum in which the visorphone may be uncomfortable to use
the visorphone is held near the ear and the visorphone is set back a little so the top edge of the visorphone will first come into contact with your earmay be bothersome as handspring enclosed these adhesive spacers for comfort when placing near earyou have to use the cradle specific to the prism as it is a bit more expensive to purchase a second onethe advantages totally outweigh the disadvantages as a reason i still bought the unitafter a lot of reasearch i picked up this camera used for 
i knew that it was a very simple model initially aimed at youth but oddly containing an expansion port
and with that expansion port i added an additional  megs of memory
so at high quality which is only x on this unit i can take  pictures at a timenow before you start thinking this is the best thing you ever saw it is very simple
if youre used to your olympus stylus not letting you take lousy pictures this one will let you take those lousy pictures
its greatest weakness is backlighting but if you can alter the gamma with your software and the stuff that comes with it is that standard dumbed down garbage youll be able to compensategreat for playing with taking pictures of the cats cars and sunsets
but dont do the wedding photos with this one
but by adding a   meg expansion you have much more capacity than many of the low end ilk
and if you want smaller look up the philips keyif your needs are for quick webbased pictures
this camera will do the trick
its handy to use and will give you decent shots for use on the web
keep in mind a few things though it needs plenty of light to give a good image
it eats batteries i got about seven shots before having to replace the first one
the fact that it supplies both usb and serial cables for connectivity is nice something that many highend cameras dont dooverall this is a highend toy  or  a lowend digital camera
dont expect too much from it
i moved up to the hp photosmart c almost immediately after purchase
but this is a decent camera for the price and one of the few at this price range which has support for macintoshcomes in a blue finished body as wellgood camera for the price
the sweet spot for the fixed focal length lens appears to be about  feet
this is the perfect digital camera for a child or young adult  a much better choice than those quotdisposablequot mm cameras
noticed some weird pixelation when the camera got closer to the subject at or around  feet
the colors sometimes get washed out by the flashpros in terms of sound quality it is aboveaverage in its class so very very comfycons it sounds very weak on portable players
if you want headphones for youre mp or cd player these are not a good choice big yes they sound good for cheap headphones
but they just dont sound as good as a pair of  headphonesanother thing worth mentioning  the cord is extremely long
this may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what youre using it for
normaly i love long cords but the cord in this is just ridiculously longif youre in the market for computer or media system headphones and want something you can wear all the time withought youre ears coming off these are a great choice
if you want some better sounding headphones and comfort isnt an issue then i would recommend the jensen jf stereo headphonesthe psc  case looks great plus it is very soft too
the pocket provides enough room for an extra memory card and battery
my only complaint is it adds a little too much bulk for your pocket
the case adds around  inch of thickness to the camera which is a lot considering the small footprint of the elph
i can put up with the bulk for the added protection the case providesthis is a nice little case from canon that safely holds not only your s but also up to two batteries two compact flash cards or one of each
however this case doesnt fit well inside the pocket of your jeans
its great as a belt clip case however
for more pocketable needs i say just sew up a thin little bag for it out of nonscratching material like from cloth lens wipe
itll be paper thin and if you can find your mom or someone experienced in the field to measure it correctly it wouldnt add any additional hassle when being usedi have an s in it and it fits very snugly
there is room for an extra memory card and thats all
i like it but i would have made it just a little less of a squeezeall i can say is that it is reasonably priced designed specifically for this camera has space for another cf card and battery pack and it even has a belt loop
what else could you ask for
buy onea must for extended sessions of photo taking  the elph generates a surprising amount of heat
this battery is well engineered incredibly lightweight and it performs
ive recharged mine  or more times and it never seems to develop those quotconditioningquot problems that other batteries getthe most helpful advice i give to other canon elph owners to conserve the battery turn the lcd viewfinder off and just use its optical viewfinder like a regular camera to take pics
after taking a pic leave the button depressed and itll popup in the lcd after a second for you to review it until you let go
i have yet to even open my backup battery using the camera this waythis battery provides a good amount of power considering its rather small size
however when being charged the battery produces an easily audible whine
at least youll know its done charging once the whining noise is gonei think the cassiopeia e is the best of the current pocket pc devices
unlike the various jornadas it is stylish
and unlike the ipaqs it doesnt have any glaring hardware deficiencies ipaq dust under the screen occasional reversed screen nonreplaceable battery
the e display is bright and beautiful brighter than i thought id ever see on a handheld devicesome things i discoveredthe technical specs say windows  is supported
what they dont tell you is that you get a usb cradle with the e but only serial rs syncing is supported under windows  so if youre using windows  youll have to either buy a serial cable or hope that you can get infrared syncing to work i couldnt
the same is true for windows nt  windows   usb works fineif youre using usb for syncing you cannot do a full backup of the device without installing a fix onto the e for the usb driver
without the fix the backup will run for a while and then get stuckthe builtin handwriting recognition works but only if you draw your letters exactly as the recognizer expects
the recognizer cannot be trained to understand your handwriting
this is little better than palms graffiti but at least you dont have to learn the graffiti chickenscratch
there is a better handwriting recognition product available called transcriber
it has much better default recognition and it is trainable for problem characters
transcriber is free and downloadable from microsofts web siteit is also on the activesync cd that comes with the elefties should note that this is a righthanded device
both the hardware buttons and the scrollbars on the appplications are laid out for rightiesunder windows every application has a little x at the top right of the window frame that you can use to close the app
that x is not present on pocket pc apps which makes it somewhat cumbersome to close applications
the fastest way to close an app is by typing ctrlq at the onscreen keyboard
this works with all the builtin applicationsi rate the e four stars for an excellent device with some software issues
if you would buy this unit for some particular application pocket explorer pocket excel etc
check internet resources to verify that the applications have the features you need before laying down your money
all quotpocketquot versions of microsoft applications have missing features that may be critical to youive owned a casio eseries pocket pc since september  and continue to use it daily at work primarily for taking notes during meetings and reminding me of appointments or special events
casios eseries devices has a wellearned reputation of posessing the best screen for indoor viewing and fairly good reliability at least compared to the original compaq ipaqs their leading competitor
if you are considering migrating from the palm platform to pocket pc or youre entirely new to pdas in general the casio e is a good bargain  its cheaper than the latest  greatest units since it has been out for well over a year and has no upgrade path to the new pocket pc  operating system but still provides all the functionality one typically uses a pda for  notetaking date and appointment reminders news reading avantgo and occasional fun stuff like viewing mpeg movies and listening to mpsif however you want to get the most from your pocket pc investment  meaning you want to explore the latest technology has to offer  id recommend going with one of the compaq ipaqs since the entire line has flashupgradable rom read only memory such that they can be upgraded quickly and inexpensively to the latest pocket pc operating system
none of the casio eseries devices have this feature nor any other upgrade path to the new os
further the new operating system supports arm processors only and the older eseries casios run mips processors meaning over time the number of new applications being developed for mipsbased pocket pcs will surely decrease
still if all you need are the features i mentioned above without the upgrade path to the newer os its hard to beat the price of an eseries casioi am very pleased with this dvd player
i have played several dvds on it and it has performed perfectly
the picture and sound are great
cant beat it for the priceall in all the dvd player is a great value  having everything you might need except optical a output port  star
but the rca jack with the bitstream information does appear to suffice and to be honest i cannot hear the difference between it and the optical on my older dvd playerthe  setup and running of this unit is very straight forward and easy but i have to admit the remote control did require me to read the instruction book just a little  star
the buttons are smaller than the older remote and a little harder to read in low light levels no back lightingreason i brought one  the dvd disc loading is fast compared to the sd  player and this unit plays dvd problem discs that my  could not which was a reason i replaced it with this  model
the image and sound quality is equal to my old toshiba  which cost me  a few years ago which at the time i thought was a steal hence the high value of the  nowunit setup  i recommend using the componenet video output if at all possible and setting the black to quotenchancedquot keep the d sound and screen saver options offunit extras  the zoom feature is nice because not only can you zoom in on more than one levels you can move around using the up down and left right buttonssummary  if you are looking for the most bang for your buck this unit might fit the bill especially if you are looking for something under 
in my opinion why spend the money if you are not going to see or hear the difference
take the savings and rent or buy more dvd movies which is the purpose of buying a dvd player in the first placebest of luck to youi bought this dvd player last christmas
im not technically knowledgeable about what all is available in dvd technology
i did some research liked what this model offered and purchased it
being not technically knowledgeable i appreciated the ease of setup and use
i have been using it for  months now and am very happy with it
ive read comments about some people being unhappy with the noise the player makes but i have not noticed any such noise
the unit is quiet and easy to operateive had this player for about two months now and generally speaking its been great
heres whats good about itit is a breeze to install especially if your tv has a svideo input its a round connector that has several prongs in it kind of what your mouse plugs into in your computerpicture quality is in my opinion excellent
even in comparison to other players of equal stature i thought this one was a tad betterthere were a couple of things that keep it from getting  stars
first of all the audio output is a little weak
if you do not have a stereo receiver to plug this in andor a digital tv the sound level may be hard to hear at times
some players have a dialogue setting that this one does notwish it didsecond after only two months i need to have it cleaned already
dvds are skipping and freezing every so often on average  seconds a movie so no big dealnevertheless for the price it is a steali like the features of this unit and now i can take my passport i from car to car without moving the plug toproduct works
i still dont understand why escort does not offer a  degree adapter or plug for the connector that plugs into the detector itself
generally this is right where the cords fail over time due to the stress of the the hard bend in the cable
my detector like most peoples is above the power connector on the dash and so there is a sharp bend in the wiring of this cord where it connects to the detector and then runs back down to the dash power connector plug
i will buy again as there are not other real options i know of other than the hard wire kit i may entertain installingi had been using a brand x power cord for the last two years and false laser alerts were becoming more and more common  to the point that i nearly couldnt use it
read on line that it could be a poor connection with power source
decided to try it
shamalama ding dong it solved the problemi was worried that the cord would not stretch long enough to reach my detector but once i took it out of the box i stretched it across my chest and my span is over  so its plenty long enough
i fired up the detector with it and all was well
now im safer from radar gunsif you have the jornada you have to get it
it is loads better than toting your laptop around
i keep both in my jacket pocket and haul em out whenever i feel the urge to be productive or write in my journalwhich i then sync with my desktop
sweeti imagine this would work very well only i found a better way to make notes for stories so its sitting in a drawer like the palmi owned my jornada  for about a month before i broke down and bought a keyboard
after laying out about  for the jornada another  for a peripheral seemed pretty steep  until i started trying to use the handwriting tools not bad if you have consistent handwriting habits and the onscreen keyboard
neither seemed to work really well for me so i broke down and bought a targus keyboard
it really has worked well for me but its not as good as it could bethe concept is great  the keyboard folds up to the size of the  when its not in use but unfolds to the size of a laptop keyboard when youre ready to use it
the keyboard has a connector that sits at about a degree angle and plugs into the jornada plus a little metal bar and plastic piece that supports the jornada when its plugged in
there is also a place to plug in a power supply so that you can keep your jornada plugged in and two small wells in the corners of the keyboard to hold a stylusthe keyboard itself works well with function keys for some common commands across applications ok esc power off and other keys that can be programmed to start up specific applications
in addition certain characters like the forward and backward slashes  and  cannot be written in the singlecharacter recognizer because the stylus strokes are used for other purposes so the keyboard helps take care of that
because the keyboard is laid out like a laptop keyboard you dont need to relearn most of your typing as long as you remember that you cant use function keys like you do on your laptopone thing it wont do however is select menu items with shortcuts as you can do in windows proper but this is a windows ce issue not a keyboard issue
another slight drawback is that the jornada interprets your use of the keyboard as using the onscreen keyboard so it displays the onscreen keyboard for you which then takes up the lower third of your screenive also had a couple of issues with the keyboard  one is that the support for the jornada is not great so you have to use two hands to turn it on with the power button and the other is that the keyboard occasionally freezes up
ive been able to correct it either by activating the special keyboard application disabling the keyboard and reenabling it or by using the onscreen keyboard to type a letter
neither is a real showstopper but they certainly are annoyancesoverall the keyboard is a great timesaver and it will certainly draw attention especially when you fold it up and store it
the size of the keyboard and pc combined may be a drawback for some and the way in which it works could be a little better
id still recommend it if you intend to do a lot of typing on your jornadaoverall i love itpros  good pictures quality  bright lcd  easy to use easy to understand controls
on the other hand i  alway have to refer to the user manual for my canon acons  the flash is too bright for show distance shots
 no lens cover  no selftimeras an avid mm photographer ive put off going digital because the cameras themselves are so limited compared to slrsso first the  is a fixed focus wide angle camera
it has a digital zoom feature but its only available when your using the lowest quality image setting
and as a very picky mm photographer i should point out that even at the higher quality settings you shouldnt expect to get highquality prints larger than snapshot size
but given the resolution of the camera the quality of the images is excellent my first use of the camera was on a disney vacation and i gave it a huge workout
i added a  meg memory card to it shot hundreds of photos and really appreciated the ability to delete pictures right out of the camera  that way you can go crazy take a ton of pictures then delete the ones that didnt work outid give the camera five stars but the fact that it doesnt come with a video cable or memory card is kind of frustrating
the built in  megs isnt enough memory to do anything except test the camerait takes very nice pictures excepting at night or dark placesthis is a pretty good deal on a kodak megapixel camera
what is a megapixel camera you ask
well its about the maximum resolution the best you would want for a digital camera whose main task will be taking pictures for emailing or website posting
higher resolution makes for larger files which require not only more time to upload ie
to transfer to an email or to post on a website but more time to download for your reader
in fact the new megapixel cameras make photo files so large that a person with a welltuned k regular modem connection would have to wait almost  minutes to download view a single photo
this particular camera then is wellsuited to internet apps and youll probably use it on lower than megapixel resolution most of the time
pros  price  quality   usb connection   compactflash expandable memory   throughthelens shooting
cons  limited zoom digital zooms are poor relatives of optical zooms   high battery usage   mediocre flash capabilityi have wanted a digital camera for so long but never wanted to pay the high price for some of the quotnecessitiesquot
this camera fit the bill
within  minutes of opening the box i was taking pictures and emailing them to grandma
within and hour i was taking pictures and loading auctions to help pay for my new toy
yes it could have come with an ac adapterlens cover etc
but in my case i would prefer to buy that next month
you can always add on buy buying a memory card usb flash card reader etc
that would make it faster but for my purposes as a quotmomquot this camera really works well for me and my budget
oh i might add i did have to call kodak for one teeny little question and they had my question answered in  seconds or less
so they do back their product
if you go to their website you can even play an interactive demo of this camera and see actual photographs
one feature that i really love is that i am able to crop and modify pics all from one place before sending them out
no more wasting download time on boring backgrounds
so if you needwant an inexpensive solution to the digital camera this would be it
if you want all the add ons and want to pay the price now you would go with  a more expensive camera
however the quality of the pic is tremendousthe  is a compact digital camera which produces excellent images
it does have its good and bad pointsgood points nice body  resembles a standard camera  viewfinder is useful  except for macro when you have to use the lcd to aim
it grips and feels like a standard camera which makes framing and squaring up an image easier for those trained on old film cameras
easy to use  despite some claims the instructions are clear and for the most the settings seem intuitive
it is easy to move between the various preset exposurespeed settings
these are preferrable over the generic auto setting
the base auto mode makes too many compromises and results in images which are just offbad points missing some stuff
it comes with a small memory card and without a rechargeable battery
like nearly all digitals the nikon inhales battery power
you must get a rechargeable battery and a larger capacity compact flash memory card
luckily the price seems to be falling on these
you should also get a card reader for your pc
hooking up the camera to the pc is possible but a card reader is far more convenient
no software included
the lens cap must be removed manually and if you forget to do so youll get very angry and worrisome sounding whirling and grinding noises
most basic point and shoot and aps cameras have a warning mechanism to prevent the recessed lens from deploying while the lens cap is on
the onoff switch is convenient but at times too much so
it can be jostled and youll reach into your bag to discover it in the on position with the battery sapped
a firmer switch with a snap would be an improvement
it is a bit pricey  i think that it would sell quite well were it  cheaperstill it is a nice camera with good technicial features and capable of producing beautiful imagesmy st digital so maybe im somewhat biased got a great deal less then  on camera battery and charger was display unit local bxxx bxx had close out on this model for some reasonthe goodgreat detail  meg is fantastic have had  x s made very comparable to mmeasy to use in auto mode easy to use in scene modethe badone irritating point is the quotnoisequot the camera makes as it tries to focus
the nikon  makes a lot of quotwhizzingquot sounds as it focuses  a bit too conspicuous in quiet environmentsmust have rechager and rechargeable batteriesno photo editing sw includedif you get beyond point and shoot it is very complicatedbottom line i really like this camera it takes incredible pictureshaving used this cp for about  yrs ive still on the learning curve and have only scratched the surface 
although most shots are quite good with the auto sequence its nice to have flexibility with manual settings
be prepared to buy the extras to make your digicam experience practical  rechargeable liion batteries and the charger upgrade to a  or better yet a  mb cf card with card reader supplied with my lexar  mb cf card
usb connectivity reader greatly expedites transfer of files to pc optional digital wallet mindswork  gb portable hd for travel and downloading on the road belt case to keep the cp close by for those once in a lifetime shots
im familiar with many controls but the manual is a bit cumbersome
im now reviewing nikon coolpix  photography by dan curtinto pick up more nuances
the cp may be a more current version and deserves consideration
all in all a great camera
my  shots taken in oregonwashingtonvancouver and victoria were burned to cds with relative ease thanks to my cp and peripherals
some of my butchart gardens shots were spectacularly polarized courtesy of a handheld  mm polarizing lense from my old  mm nikorrmatstrengths lightweight easy to use from full automatic to full manual
depth of field preview excellent feature
 ae lock quick auto focus for price range seven focusing points
countless lenses and accessories available both from canon and third party mfgrs
if you have large hands i recommend the optional battery pack  which also doubles as a vertical grip with duplicated shutter control and port for remote switch
i simply cant imagine these features on any other camera at a comptetitive price
thinking about a quotpoint and shootquot
save your money and get this camera insteadweaknesses included manual not very comprehensive but spend a few hours with this camera and you can figure most features out yourself
if you need written instructions id recommend the excellent magic lantern guidealso try another lens like a mm aspherical lens if you want just one lens to carry aroundif you have a canon g or g digital camera youve probably noticed the limitations of the builtin flash
its way too close to the lens which causes images to look flat and lifeless and the color of the light tends to wash out colors as wellthe canon speedlite  is a pretty big device its basically the same size as the camera and about the same weight w batteries
for that additional bulk however you get a powerful flash that can bounce light off walls and ceilings creating much more professionallooking results
the improvement over the builtin is really like night and dayi bought ex flash for use with canons g camera which is one step less than conventional slrs
for long my indoor photography has suffered
but now with this great accessory i can bounce light to create brilliant and vivid images
the flash utilizes ettl and also adjusts to the cameras zoomthe only reason i rated the flash  stars is that the autofucos assist beam function is not working with my camera
i probably will get in touch with canon and find out if this feature is compatible with g series camera or notbought this flash about two weeks ago for use with my canon powershot g digital camera and have been nothing but impressed with it
it mates beautifully to the canon although it does make it somewhat bulky
the bounce flash photography is beautiful and the ettl system just makes you look like a total pro
i also look forward to using it for wireless flash photographythere are some things missing however
compared to my canon  ez flash there is no lcd display
no flash compensation but this isnt a big deal since thats controlled from my g
no strobe
if these are important to you step up to the  ex
otherwise the  is a beautiful workhorsei have been dissatisfied with the built in flash on my digital rebel
bought this two weeks ago and have used it extensively
the batteries last forever
main improvement is when using it as a bounce flash
much better colors softer light no redeye
it can be used as a slave flash but only with the much more expensive  series
the only reason i give it a  is that the new ex just came out with significantly improved functionality
however the pricing is probably much higher than these closeout pricesthe greatest shortcoming of the canon digital rebel camera is its built in popup flash
the popup flash produces inadequate light and greatly underexposes many situations  and often is not spaced high enough from the camera body to avoid redeye lens hood or telephoto lens body shadow
i purchased the ex to improve on these situationsafter a year of use  i like my purchase of the exthings i enjoy with my ex more powerful than the built in flash of the digital rebel
swivelbounce head offers great flexability for many different situations
synchs perfectly to the digital rebels exposure computer through the hotshoe or hot shoe extender cord
measures zoom level of standard zoom camera lens  and gives a good overall automatic exposure
light enough to mount on an lu aluminum bracket without throwing the camera out of balance
use of a bge battery grip is highly recommended with a portrait photographers u bracket
not a power hog
can get up to  photos out of a set of four  amphr nimh aa rechargables
always have a second set ready to go if on assignment  with a charger for the expended batteries
works well in slave mode
this is where it earns its money for me
works well with a bounce light diffuser hood for portrait work
height above lens eliminates most redeye situations
great value for the money
hot shoe mount eliminates all but the longest telephoto lens shadowsthings i d like to see improve not powerful enough
you can never have enough light
the ex gains almost two full fstops over the ex  though you pay a price almost double in cost
battery door is flimsy  and sometimes fails to latch securely
this is embarassing when youre shooting for a client and batteries are rolling all over the place  i know i need to be more careful
tends toward underexposure in large or high ceilinged rooms
you can never have enough light
lacks strobe lcd display functions of the more expensive exa good solid product for most occasions
a great value for the money
improves on the digital rebels anemic popup flash
eliminates most redeye situations
still not powerful enough for the discriminating photographeryou can get more flash for your dime if you go offbrand but i wanted hss
the ex is ettl only manual flash cannot be set on the unit or from my ti
it works great as an offcamera fill flash outdoors hss with ettl cord or as an easy bounce flash indoors oncamera for its focus assist
it does autozoom when you have an appropriate lens attached it defaults to mm for other lenses
tilt and swivel are great
construction quality is excellent but due to the design of the battery hatch i feel as if i might break it any time i change the batteries
i dont really require quick recycle times so i cant evaluate that
battery life seems great
if you have a commander the ex can be an wireless slave
ill report more about that after i win the lottery and buy a ex iiedit aug  i now own three canon exs
theyre a lot of flash for the money and they have canon wireless and hss
i trigger mine with yongnuos stethe ex has a plastic foot
i broke the side of one foot when a light stand blew over
ive glued it back and all systems are goodi bought this flash as an upgrade for my now almost ancient powershot g
i had originally liked the idea the g had a hot shoe and would someday take an external flashi waited too long
the difference is night and day on the quality of any picture inside or outside shot with the flash
it easily mated with the g and the bounce adjustment creates really nice effects with light on indoor shots
lighting is much more natural and the distance that the flash will light is a big improvement
personally i believe the bounce option makes this a better choice than the  series canon flashthere is simply no comparison with using the built in flashi highly recommend this flash for anyone with a decent digital camera that can take an external flash  youll be very happy with the improvementsi bought this flash to use on my canon rebel xt
the first thing i noticed was that without even reading the instructions i was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors
being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash
even when i set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down
it did not need anytime to recharge at alli recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots
most of the pictures came back with great results
the only dissappointment i have is that when taking shots from further distance than i normally would the pictures came back darker than i wouldve liked
so to compensate for this i adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it rightanother problem i have with the flash is the battery cover
its flimsy and i find it awkward to open and close at times
i always feel like im gonna snap it off by accidentoverall i am happy
its a good flash for the price you pay
the battery life is good
i still havent even had to recharge the batteries and ive almost taken  shots with it
my low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash
anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash
the difference is night and daythe initial results were excellent but i must admit i was a little surprised to see how long the lens becomes when at maximum focal length
the weight also intimidated me at first but when mounted on a canon digital rebel xti with a battery grip attached it seems to balance out decentlyi do have to say that in accordance with other reviews low light is not a friend of this lens
i havent done much outdoor photography due to time contraints time of the year etc
 but what ive done has turned out very clear and pleasing
i have a feeling that welllit outdoor shots is where this lens might excel bestthis is definitely a massive upgrade over the kit lens in focal length size weight and quality so be prepared for all fourim not sure if the price justified the purchase but i think that if good care is taken of this lens then over time it will surely pay itself offdo i recommend
only if you find the digital rebel kit lens too limiting and want that extra focal length if you dont mind the extra size if you have a need for the extra zoom and are ready for upgrading
otherwise practice on the kit lens or a cheaper lens for a while before moving upi got this lens for a wedding i shot
since i only had one camera at the time i was afraid of losing shots as i switched back and forth
since i was in need i paid full retail price
couple of comments
you need to have an external flash and be able to do bounce lighting for this lens to be really useful inside
its a slow lens as the aperature is small
this lens is what i would call an average lens
it does everything good but nothing great
the advantages of this lens is the great focal length capability
mm covers alot of ground
if you travel and you just want to keep memories for yourself and keep your filmdigital camera at full auto or f  to  you will get great results
use a  or a  ex flash and that will help compensate for indoors
i think the focal lengths work better for full frame or film cameras over the small sensor digital camerasthe thing about this lens is the greatest asset of the lens is also the greatest weakness
to be able to provide mmmm at  bucks it requires alot of compromises
its slow indoors or requires flash which for most people is okay
you will get softness if you blow pictures up past x
its heavy and long
it doesnt have a small depth of focus for your close ups it needs to be on a tripod for mm unless you can hold it very steady and even then you will want a flashif you want a good all around lens under  this is your lens
if you want to spend a little more you get is and usm with the mm
my feeling is you take great pictures with a lens you have not a lens you dont have
i think for begineers and for a fun day just shooting regular pictures this is a great lens
save the artsy pictures and the emotional pictures for a mm  or a mm  or a up close picture for the mm
this is a good all around for good pictures not great onesi received my  yesterday from amazon
having read the customer reviews i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the  and my canon  is
three shots each at fstops   and  one set indoors at iso  and the other outdoors at iso   focal length  using the same scenes with each camera highest jpeg setting
after shooting both series i compared them fresh out of the camera side by side
results  the  was at least as sharp as the  in both foreground and background in most instances
it was visibly sharper at iso  with fstops  and  the  took the honors at fstop  and at  it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background
the  was onestop faster shutterwise
both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop
there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider different test scenes conceivably produce different results
my conservative conclusion  the  is as good as it gets for a superzoom on your canon unless you are going to drop  on the l series  is and carry it and the  is has no clear sharpness advantage
between these lenses its a tradeoffan extra  mm of focal length  mm after a  conversion versus image stabilization and lowlight shooting capability
both lenses focus quickly and silently and both lenses produce usable shotsif youre a professional photographer you can probably ignore this review
but then you probably wont be thinking about buying this lens anyway as youll be off to purchase a nice l serieshowever if  like me  you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera or equivalent and enjoy taking decent pictures this lens will probably work out very well for you
ive taken well over  pictures with it in a couple of weeks and it has performed very much as expected
for the price its perfect for a goeverywhere lensa few main points
okay its not the best image quality
even on lowmedium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses
it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit but for welllit outdoor shoots its works  very wellof course it would be nice to have a nice l series with is but if you cant afford that then this is a very good value lens
not for the real professionals but great if you dont take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom  and lets face it who doesnt want a but more zoomthis is great lens that i use all the time
there is only one problem i had and that is dust
after less then a year i got one big peace of dust on the inside of the lens that cost over  to have removedas long as you take care not to let this happen it is a great lens to havetill yesterday i was all praises for this camera and would have given  stars
its got the features for a beginner to reach a serious amature role with low cost
well yesterday it died on me
i have had the camera for  years and shot probably around  rolls with itnow its a great camera
its given me some awesome pictures
i like the metering except the fact that is does not have spot metering
this is a disadvantage
more over the the partial region of the camera is not well defined
i have the eye control
 it works and its great
but it does fail and irritates me at times
low light focus is not so good but with the speedlightex it focus in a sec
what a difference
the depth of preview button is at time hard to findi love the fash  frames per second
i used it twice but it gave me great results
i love the feel of the camerawith all its defects i love the camera and might go in for the samei decided to upgrade my slr camera
ive had a canon t for about  years and really liked it but now i would like to do some more creative things with the aperature and shutter speeds whereas the t didnt have any controls for creativity but was a great point and shoot slrthis camera is much bigger than my t but has tons more features
i just love auto focus now
this camera lets you focus on whatever your eyes look at and focuses quickly and quietly
and film transport is basically silent compared to the t which is so loud that whenever i would take a photo the noise would draw everyones attentionthe lens that comes with this is the lower end but is usm ultra sonic and is fine for point and shoot and does have a nice wide angle and fairly good zoom mmthis camera isnt quite as solid as my t as that camera could be tossed around and held up beautifully over the years but this camera needs more tlc as it is more plasticy but considerably better than canons other slrs excluding the higher ended eoss such as eos d and eos the flash is adequate for most close up purposes but suggest an external one for large groups at a distance where you can also set the angle of the flashover all this is a fun camera
has so many features to experiment with
and the tracking focus is awesome for photographing anything moving fast such as cars horses etcid recommend it to anyone and prices seem to have dropped since it was introduced
enjoythis lens should have come with the canon rebel xtit is noticable improvement over the kit lenswithin a month i purchaced the fnon isl lens and love iti needed a better quality all around lens and chose the  usmimage and sharpness are good at f or better and overall results are very good outdoorsi have only taken  or so shots with it so far but plan on using it alot in the futurei purchaced the canon hood at the same timemy next investment will be a good flashbut for now i am set on lensesfor the price you cant beat this lensi recommend it as and upgrade for rebel xt kitor buy the body and lens seperateafter purchasing my first dslr canon rebel xsi i quickly discovered that the kit  just didnt have the range i needed
i somehow landed a job doing freelance work for the local newspaper the same day i got my camera so i needed something that would give me more versatility on a very limited budget
after reading the reviews i ended up with this and ive been pleasedgranted this is not an l lens but at this price i wouldnt expect that
also if you have shaky hands or take a lot of photos in low light this may not be the right lens for you
it might be worth looking into the  is
in decent light this lens takes beautiful photos and ive had many successful results with it
it is great outdoors i recommend purchasing a lens hoodi recently purchased my first l lensthe mm and while its a great lens the  still lives on my camera for its versatility
and even though im now in the market for something with is faster and with more range i think ill still be hanging on to this one for awhile
if i wasnt serious about photography as a career and used this as just a hobby lens i would be thrilled
if you want something affordable with decent quality i highly recommend thiswhile its not a very fast lens one will be hardpressed at finding one with as wide of a focal range and as quiet of a motor as this one at this price
ive shot with this lens in a church and i couldnt hear it focus even then
images could be a little sharper but im not complaining
i highly recommend itpretty decent for a zoom lens
it does the job if you need a zoom lens auto focus can be a little trickywhile this is obviously not an l lens it still has great quality for the price
the autofocus is second to none in most situations and the pictures are very crisp
it is extremely well constructed and if your on a budget like me is the best lens to upgrade from the basic mm lens
the ability to manually focus while still on autofocus is great for those shots you cant get it to perfectly pick up on
all in all a great canon product
for the money its definitely  stars but in the grand scheme of things a  is more appropriatethis lens isnt something uber professionals would probably use but for a novice like me with a canon rebel this lens has been greati use this lens on the canon digital rebel
it gives me great color amp sharpness up to x
canon makes better lens than this but for this price range you cant beat it
id reccommend it to any one
if i lost this one today id order another one tomorrowthis is a good general lens
i bought a canon d body only
the kit lens was out of stock and i wasnt getting good enough reviews to wait around until it was available
i purchased this lens as my primary lens
i had read good reviews and it was well within the price range
the autofocus is quick and smooth and picture quality is very goodexcellent
i think this is a great choice to replace a kit lens and not break the bankfor the times when i want to travel light and only take one lens i usually throw this lens on
through its entire focal range it does a great job
its performance is exceptional considering its not an quotlquot grade lensthe lens is constructed well and has a nice feel
i have an elan e body and this lens complements it very nicely
the ultrasonic motor is definitely a nice touch
you cant even hear the lens focusing its so quiet not to mention fast
i find that mm is a great range for everyday shooting and if youre into taking closeups it has a fairly good macro mode although i wish it could be a little betternikons equivalent lens has a macro reproduction ratio of about  which this lens doesnt come close tobut its a nikonblehi would advise anyone buying this lens to also purchase the accessory hood thats available for itone thing ive learned from the reviews here is that it would be easier to weight comments if you knew more about the reviewer
i am still a relative newbie and have progressed from an old pentax film slr through the basic point and shoot digitals to a more advanced point and shoot and about  months ago i bought a used rebel xt from a friend
i thought the kit lens was a huge step up from the ps cameras and was amazed by the image quality of this lens
most of my comparisons are to the canon mm f is usm lens which was the other lens i was considering when i made this purchase
i have had the chance to use both and am still happy with the choice i madethe lens makes beautiful photos throughout its zoom range although it likes natural light better than artificial
it is the best first upgrade i can imagine for anyone who isnt a professional but then you arent really considering this lens if you are
if you do more of your shooting indoors consider spending the extra  for the  is usm which handles low light better
outdoors i find that this lens works better than the  producing sharper images especially when you are able to shoot at f or higher
images are sharp colors are true and beautiful and this lens is capable of some stunning bokeh effects if you take the time to experiment with it
i am able to get sharp images all the way to f at mm unlike some of the other reviewers here maybe differences in copies of the lens
im not sure why it just workshaving said all that lately i have had the opportunity to spend time shooting with different lenses borrowing from a friend who is something of a semipro and i am starting to see the weaknesses of this lens
as i mentioned before it tends to focus slowly in low light situations and images tend to be underexposed in tungsten light
it can be compensated for once you know about it but the  is is easier to use indoors
if you dont mind using flash its no big deal but its worth mentioning
its also a little short for my liking lately
im finding i prefer to sit outside the action where my presence wont influence the shot and mm is sometimes a little short for that
thats more an issue of suitability rather than a weakness in this lens thoughin summary this is the lens to get for the first upgrade from the kit lens
it works great as an every day lens giving up only a little at the wide end compared to the kit lens but capable of far sharper brighter images everywhere
for the money you cant beat it
would i replace it if lost or broken
you beti have owned this lens for about a month now
i opted for this one instead of the mm kit lens upon reading numerous reviews that it is a great general purpose lens for startersi have to say i am impressed with canons usm system and a relatively fast auto focus
i havent had a single time when the subjet was out of focus because of the lens mistakeit is pretty sharp around f all through the focal range mostly within mm rangeto sum uppros a good general purpose canon branded lens
mm is a decent focal range for starters usm is great af is good mostly accurate light weight not bulky in size decently sharp throughout most of the rangecons colors are not very bright or vibrant but a little post processing is all it needsfinal notesthe mm is great for its flexible range and the decent sharpness and usm i have used it for everything from semimacros to portraits to landscapes to long exposure shots at night to birds
and the build is professionally solid
worth the moneythis is a very good allaround lens
when you consider price image quality and its range of uses via the zoom range available its hard to beatthe image quality is hit or miss
mostly its just average or slightly above average
again though i recommend this lens mainly because its flexible in its zoom range not terribly expensive has usm focusing and takes respectable though not superb pictures
thats a pretty good package of offerings if you want one lens to do a lot of different things within an attractive zoom range of of course if you have an aps size sensor as opposed to a fullsize sensor those zoom ranges are effectively   mm
so be aware that your wide end of  is not so wideotherwise this lens is merely good
ive had this lens for a little over a year and have taken numerous rolls on it in all kinds of settings and conditions
it does what it promises to which is to provide a nice widetomedium telephoto focal range suitable for  of casual photography with the fast ring type ultra sonic motor autofocus
it also lets you focus manually even if the switch is on af which is really slick
if it werent for these features i might not have given it a  because the optics are just not that good
its not very sharp at any focal length and it produces duller colors than the other  lenses i havebut like i said the lens performs as its meant to  as a better than entry level consumer grade lens
the usm is so fast that it justifies the lenss optical shortcomings
your subject simply pops into focus instantaneously when you start to depress the shutter
im about to move on to a sharper and more quotcontrastyquot lens but itll be heavier bigger and wont focus as fast
the time that i did spend with this lens produced some very nice results and it served its purpose quite well as a solid stepping stone in my continuing education as a photographerwish it had is
but besides that its a good lense pretty slow  focusing at very short range probably because i dont have very steady hands which is also why i wish it had image stabilization but if you have steady hands i wouldnt worry about it
i tend to manually focus at that point besides that its pretty quick and works wellthe sound is pretty good for small inear headphones as these certainly better than other brands ive tried and the price is good too
the only slight irritation is that the foams fall off quite easilymine recently broke apart but they lasted a really long time and sounded great
i need to find the latest model of these and buy them againfairly comfortable i find most earbuds and inear phones difficult to take with almost no noise isolation youll hear everything around you
the little foam covers come popping off and are easily lost
the little case is excellent and makes transporting these safely easy
overally inexpensive fairly good sounding just the thing to carry in the computer bagive only had them for a month but so far im quite satisfied
they have a good sound noticeably better than your bargain basement earbud
my main concern now is to see how durable they are or if they break down after  months like a lot of earbuds
if they prove they can stand the test of time my review would move up to  starsintroductionsome time ago i was browsing a few of my favorite sites when i came across a deal for two pairs of the mx earbuds
the price was right and given my lack of quality earbuds i decided to jump on this deal if only to have a decent pair of earbuds i can use to listen to my music at times where isolation from the surrounding environment is not quite ideal
when i received them after a few days i began burning them in as per my usual listening to them intermittently throughout the process
what i heard was actually quite surprisingdesign and build qualityconstructed entirely of plastic the housings of the mx dont exactly inspire confidence and feel rather cheap to the touch
the plastic cabling is quite tangleprone and isnt quite as soft or flexible as i wouldve liked and terminates in a nickelplated mm straight jack
as a whole the mxs dont seem like they would be able to stand up to a great deal of abuse and should be toted around in a case if at all possiblesound qualityas i said from the start i was more or less expecting decent quality from the mxs nothing spectacular nor particularly bad
what i did not expect was to be blown away by the sound of the mxs but here i am
these are quite easily the best sounding earbuds ive ever heard and to explain why ill start at the bottomthe way the mxs present bass is very polite and controlled
its punchy enough to make itself known when it needs to be and never rises up unnecessarily
speed is certainly a strong suit of the mxs and can come and go quite easily
perhaps that is the achilles heel of the low end presentation because it doesnt seem to have realistic levels of decay and once bass has hit it seems to disappear just as quickly
these can definitely be described as bass light overall but that can be augmented with a warm sounding amp or even a cheap fiio ethe midrange brings to the table nice detail and transparency
vocals take center stage in the presentation seeming to sit in front of the instruments
treble is very smooth and somewhat laid back lacking the type of sparkle and crispness that ive grown to enjoy from iems such as the rethe soundstage is what wowed me the most about the mxs
both width and depth are very impressive and created an out of head feeling as if the music was coming at me from outside of the earbuds themselves
due to the large soundstage the mxs are adept at presenting distance between instruments and good at spatial positioning within the soundscape
the best aspect of the soundstage is that its large without being too large
i never got the sense that i was disconnected from the music on the contrary the mxs were surprisingly intimate with most tracksi did find that theres noticeable graininess and dryness throughout the presentation
this is perhaps the biggest flaw of the mxs
notes are harder and edgier than i prefer and while this may be a bit of a drawback to me some users may enjoy this for certain hard rock or metal tracks
in addition to this graininess the mxs have a somewhat cold almost analytical sound about them which is decently resolving but not the most natural or musical soundingconclusionthe mxs are the best purchase ive ever made in terms of earbuds blowing all of the other earbuds ive tried which isnt much admittedly out of the water
sure these have their flaws but given my relatively low expectations im very pleased with these earbuds
considering that these are several years old and have since been replaced by the slightly higher end mxs and sennheisers new expression line of earbuds im confident that sound quality will only improve as you move up the ladder
personally im more of a fan of iems than earbuds for a number of reasons but if i were currently in the market for a new pair of earbuds id definitely start with sennheisersnonetheless the mxs have delivered on everything i wanted them to
they sound better than decent were extremely cheap and i dont have to worry about babying them too much
the mxs can be found online for cheap and i can definitely recommend them to people who need a cheap knock around pair of earbudsthese ear buds arent the loudest but they also are far from expensive
their wind up case is nice and they carry the famous sennheiser build quality
i highly recomend these to whoever doesnt want to get robbed on the street for wearing white ear budsi just got a twopack from buycom for cheap
they didnt come with the windy case but they are genuine
i have a pair of genuine yearold mxs for comparison and they sound the same if not better
the treble is amazing as i am sitting here listening to aynin by the durans
i am hearing things that i do not normally hear
they are a bit uncomfortable as all buds are to my ears after a while
but for the price of a large fry check them out
you do have to boost the bass a bit
it probably doesnt hurt that i have a cowon d and a sansa clip
remember you have to feed it with something good to get good out of itaka not an ipodyes i own onesennheiser makes very good headphones and even though this is inexpensive the quality is still there
my only complaints are that the sound is really lound and i need to turn down the volume on the computer and mp player for those headphones and then back up when these items are hooked up to other things
my other complaint is the length of the cord
the wire is not very long and so as i move my head the headphones keep coming out of my ears since the cord is so shorti heard that stock earbuds that come with any mp player suck so i bought this thing
well for  its one of the cheapest earbuds youll find out there
the sound quality is pretty good not great duh its only 
just because people give this high rating doesnt mean you should expect some great technology that will deliver everything
its good for the price
when i lost these earbuds i temporarily switched back to the stock earbuds
i was shocked shocked to find that the stock sony mdre which came with the sony nwe sounded better than these sennheisers
sigh now if only the stock earbuds werent so shorti generally prefer sennheisers neutral sound
naturally i prefer this bud over other brands earbuds which tend to have boosted sound
mx has so far given me troublefree service over  years of usagei recently bought sennheisers cx inearcanal buds
at first i didnt care for cxs sound because bass sounded so pumped up compared to mx
but over time i came to be more appreciative of cx because cx still delivered neutral sound in mid and high frequency region similar to mx after you listen to less bassy music and bass isnt muddymx is superior to cx in   touching line does not produce wind noise in your ear buds as is the case with cx  mx comes with a nice case whereas cx doesntwell i am not a bass friend but i would like to get more bass from this earimho this earphone is overrated
this is a very popular and good earphone and it get a broad recognized
i am a music friend who writes electronic equipments test report
i deal with many music players and earbuds
this earphone is good for those people who enjoy pure music
if you love rb and rap a sony one with close price would be your choicethis earphone is also getting a high recognition in some chinese forums im from china so i know it but i guess it is just a good choice due to its cheaper price and acceptable quality
generally if you good for price and you do not care much about bass this would be a good choicei am buying another mx from sennheiser and i will let you guys know how i think about that one later oni wanted the best earbuds to go with my new muvo
it was either gonna be sony or sennheiser
i own the senn hd and love them
so i bought the mx thinking they would give the best bangforthebuck considering the sonys go as high as the bass is definately there but not as powerful as i expected
i tested them with a thx bass soundclip
i can barely hear anything below hz possibly due to my bad hearinga friend got the sony  for under  a couple days ago
seriously neither of us could tell the difference between the two
so hes happy and im not too thrilled
go for the senns if you like the volume control and colorim using the sennheiser mxs exclusively with my new g gb ipod
i purchased these because ive repeatedly heard that the apple earbuds were pretty underwhelming
i have not tried the apple earbuds and theyre still in the antistatic sealed bagbefore i had these i was using an older pair of sony mdra headphones
those are the buds that enter the ear perpendicular to the side of your head mounted on a foldable abovethehead band
as a reference i considered the sonys to not be so greatthe first thing that youll notice is that the sennheisers give you fantastic detail
with the sony headphones i wasnt able to hear as much detail i also couldnt tell the difference between the aac files and mp files on my ipod
while the mp files sound better than before i can clearly tell that the aac files are higher quality yes they are the same bitrate as mphowever with the increased clarity and detail i have noticed that the bass isnt great
i can still hear the bass but it isnt so powerful
this isnt a real problem unless you listen to hiphop or classical jazz
i listen to a pretty good variety of music and havent been bothered by this on a lot of other genres
i particularly like the sound of live music classic rock and vocalintensive music with these earbudsive read a lot of other reviews and will comment on other features cord length is sufficient but could be longer the volume slider is very small and very convenient
another reviewer made the comment that its a linear volume switch
to clarify the switch slides along a linear axis it is not a knob or dial which helps keep the size small
however the volume is controlled by a logarithmic potentiometer not a linear potentiometer this is good because humans hear on a logarithmic scale
just a friendly clarification for any other ees out there who might care the buds seem to fit my ears but i probably have big ears i definitely have a big melon the protective case works well but isnt a special featureat the end of the day im very happy with the  i spent on these
i highly recommend these to anyone who wants something inexpensive and highly portablebought these at the suspiciously low price of 
are they chinese fakes
if so the quality is very goodpros excellent star sound for most types of music  the bass is very good just not mega buy the sonys for that
delivers high volume with minimal distortion
convenient inline volume control
i liked the unequal cords because they allow placement behind the neck and are less obstructivecons earphones too large for my ears hence  stars only left bud kept slipping out so i have one small eardrum
overall a good replacement set of earphones for my broken sandisk m set
i cant understand the lack of bass complaints  its there loud and clear
dont blame me if theyre chinese fake what can i say
i was skeptical at first until i received them
i dont believe the very expensive earphones are any better than these cheap ones
maybe i was luckybut then i also got lucky on a  set of sony mdr ex headphones that i use when i really need to crank up the bass
regardless of origin i love these earphones and would highly recommend them for anyone who loves listening to a wide range of music keep the sony exs for heavier stuffokay this is an edited review
i thought the volume on these was atrocious but actually i didnt see the volume switch on the chord which i must say doesnt exactly stand out and it was set to min
so my real rating would be  or a   in terms of value definately a the sound range is great the comfort is quite good the earbuds might be slightly too big in terms of comfort but i guess that makes them not fall out as easily
i like that the lengths of the two wires to the ears are actually equal i dont know what idiotic product designer thought it would be a good idea to start that trend of having one be short and constantly tugging at my ear
the windup function though nothing new to the market is also a convenient function for me since my old ones would always get tangled up in the front pocket of my backpackedit  not the most durable earphones i seem to replace them every couple of years but theyre cheap so why noti got these earphones primarily for the inline volume control and the wind up case
when i fly i like to listen to music on my pda and on those very long flights i like to watch the occassional dvd
before the mx i simply had a cheap pair of philips earbuds that worked okay
i didnt realize how poor the quality was until i got my mx
much fuller bass and still very comfortable i chose not to use the pads that came with it
my only criticism is that the wire is sometimes too short at  ft  of course if they were much longer id be complaining about how long it wasgood quality and good price
very traditional design and sounds really good
i am not sure how well it compares with those expensive siliconmolded intheear designs
but those cost quite a pretty penny
so these ones are very good for the price rangeim a long time pro audio engineer
i buy lots of different headphones almost as a hobby
i have a pair of etymotic i earbuds the sony s and now these sennheisers
although i record primarily jazz i listen to alot of dance and hip hop
i believe the etymotics and sennheisers are pretty accurate and reflect the anemic bass output of the ipod headphone amp
when i use the classical eq setting i get the kind of bass i like with these phones
listening through my audio gear the basstreble response is pretty true though
the sonys dont require any bass boost on the ipod but dont have the same liveliness on the treble side the others do
have fun and experimentthese are great earbuds with some small caveatsif you have small ears they will be uncomfortable
i have larger ears and i have to fuss with them to get the position just rightthe little foam covers on the buds seem delicate and have fallen off a few timesthe cord is short maybe  ft which is fine for a portable player but is awkward for using with many computers or other non handheld components
i just got a miniplug extension cord at radioshack to fix that and it is greaton the plus sidethe sound is very clean and natural sounding with no excess bass or treblei did not realize it for over a month but there is a tiny linear volume control on the cord which is very nicethis are the most recommended cheaper earbuds  i did a lot of review searching and i wholeheartedly agreeit sounds great for classical music acoustic instruments etc but is rather weak on the bass for hiphop and pop music
even the standard earbuds that came with my muvo have more basshowever it is sennheiser overall quality is great and it does come with a  year warranty which is better than my muvo earbuds which broke within a few weeks of getting themthe cord is only a meter long and a bit on the short side
the oncord volume control is handy and the blue color is nicebut for  its a good deal
but it could be betteri listen to jazz so my comments are related to this type of music
the mxs provide a very good sound when you set your ipod equilizer to flat
most other settings result in a sound that is overly bright not natural
the mx do not provide any relief from the sounds around you unless you turn up the volume pretty high
all that said i do like the mx better than the ear buds that came with my ipodi bought the mxs also one of those amazon buy two and save deals
these ear buds do not sound better than the ear buds that come standard with an ipodi would classify this headphone extension as light duty
the wire material is small diameter which is nice and the coil is likely to stretch a little faster than more heavy duty type
this is to be expected on any coil type wire
the connectors are your typical molded pieces
i expect to have to replace them at some time in the future
again not a fault but a reality for any cable
for the price you cant beat these
the adapters are very functional and handy to have in your kitthe headphones i ordered sony mdrxb for my desktop pc and entertainment system had a too short cord
now i can listen to music or movies from anywhere in my living room
the sound quality seems unaffected using these headphone extension cords
im satisfied with this purchasethis extension cord is a lifesaver
i recently installed a very noisy air conditioner in my apartment and as a result i could not hear my tv without blasting the sound
not wanting to be that neighbor i invested in this cord so i could watch tv with headphones
ill echo what others have said the cord transmits sound very well even through my rinky little ipod headphones though the coil is pretty tight and reaching to  feet is a stretch pun slightly intended
im fine with that because the jacks on the cord are very secure no slipping and i only need about  feet of extension but if youre looking to use this for longer distances then id suggest buying two cords
still ten bucks is a good value for this handy little producti use this to supplement my headphones when i am watching tv at home
i get better sound quality through the headphones and am able to sit a good distance from the screen
another big plus they minimize tangling when i hide the cord behind the consolenot much to say other than it works as advertised
no kinks
doesnt seem to affect sound quality
i can wheel around my cube at work as neededthis worked exactly as expected so that i am not tied so closely to the computer or tablet when i need to use headphonesit gave me the extra length i needed and it has several sizes of adapters which while i havent used them will probably come in handy in the futurejust what i needed to use with my ipad so i can move about
pretty light weight but good for the pricethis is a great product it contains everything you will need the cord stays nice and tight until your ready to use it and then stores up in a tight packageat the time of writing this i can only seem to find this coiled mm extension cordand thats not a bad thing
this comes with  adapters and they all work well
ive been testing this cable with sennheiser hds and i dont have any issues
the only complaint or minor annoyance i have is that although it is  feet long the majority of it coiled tightly
so while you may not reasonably be able to stretch it the entire  feet it is certainly manageable
i use this in conjunction withcables to go    mm stereo female to rca male ycableconnected to my tv and its great not wake others up when i play gears of warcoupled with a ft cord ysplitter and  sets of headphones this is a good way for  people to listen to tv or play video games after the rest of the house has gone to bed
this will only stretch out about  feet before it starts to tug  against the headphone line but its lightweight enough that you can deal with that
adapters are useless unless you plan on using them in a foreign country or on a plane
i threw mine awaythis extension worked very well
the narrowness of the cable and its coiling makes it more compact  easy to storethe main reason for getting this accordion extension is because the distance from my vintage dokorder receiver and my bed is just a little too far for me to use my sony mdrv studio monitors when listening to audio books or music
the sony accordion cord will make it but it is just too tight for comfort
i have a nice accordion extension somewhere but cant find it
so instead of tearing up everything i decided to get this one
one cant have too many small necessitiesafter reading the one and two stars it is apparent that half of the one stars are sour grapes ratings for not getting perfection at a very very low price
obviously the entitlement mentality is alive and well in the usim giving this extension cord four stars because the weight  of the cord is less than that of my lost extension cord and also my sony cord
and too the length is something to be aware of since maxell is using the ideal starting length before the cord was heat treated in order to make it an accordion unit
but that is something that anyone using common sense would know up frontsound quality wise things are no less than anticipated
expecting sound to be as good as one without another connection is expecting too much
electrons flow from point a to point b and any connection short being fused together is going to offer resistance in the flow of electrons which will cause the signal to be ideally less than without the joint
again another common sense issueas for loose connections i tried the connection to my sony and it was solid
however plugging into the dokorders phones jack the connection was less than tight where it fit into the  sony adaptor
but that i can forgive because the cord will disconnect before it does damage to the adapter and i think this was intentionalover all a product that is of sound quality
the length and weight of the cord is not audiophile quality but i am not paying audiophile prices either
to all the disenfranchised one star raters if this is enough to totally ruin your weekend you have more than just a problem here
i suggest you seek counselingi do not know what it is but you can buy every adapter there is and still be missing the one you need
i do use this a lot since it gives me the freedom to wander about a bit without being tethered so tightlyi chose this rating because honestly how much can you say about a head phone extension cord
it works just fineim using this cable to extend my headphone cable to the tv when i dont want to disturb my wife with the noise
i cant hear any difference when adding the length but my tv doesnt exactly have a very good headphone amp to begin with
i would prefer gold contacts but the price was right
im satisfiedit is very nice to have the ability to have these and use them when i need them
thanks alotgood as maxell usually is
handy to have mm adapters for modern equipment andn for intage stereo
useul for even longer cord headphonei found this product to work well and serve the purpose of sound control in my cubicle at the office
the cord is long enough to move around easily and i can even use just one earpiece whenif i am needing to listen for visitors etci found it to be well worth the pricethe cord is thick and sturdy and the shielding is visible through the transparent jacket
the connectors are easy to handle
its pretty much a high quality cat ethernet cable terminated on standard rj connectors
as some have noted the connectors lock in rather tightly
to disconnect i push the tab all the way down and push the connector slightly to one side
that seems to permit the connector to release more easilymy house is an early s house with cat wiring for the phone lines
centurylink provides the dsl and im paying for mbps service
the service tech noted mbps at the jack one of the longest runs in the house with his test equipment
while speedtestnet is not generally an accurate measurement of bandwidth because its heavily dependent on the network and servers outside of centurylinks control i rarely got over mbps during actual computer usei started by connecting my dsl modem using a plain ol telephone cord
i ran three tests using speedtestnet immediately before and after installing this hispeed modem cable
i made sure to use the same test servers on the website
i saw no noticeable change in bandwidth after the hispeed cable was installedwas it worth the expense to me even though i see no appreciable change in bandwidth
yepbecause for a paltry seven bucks i was able to remove one potential bottleneck in my network
going forward as i improve the wiring in the house i wont have to wonder if the old and basic phone cords are responsible for bandwidth problemsi use this to connect my mp player to modern av equipment tvs stereos etc
works well and is just long enoughif you are reading this you want to know if it is stereo and works at the price
and the answer is yesthe type of audio and songs that i listen to dont testify to the sound quality very much
but so far its been a good facilitating tool
i recommend the audio accessories belkins produces
ive had belkins audio spliter ipod rubber grip and this and they all perform wellthis antistatic wrist band makes a nice constant ground contact between my skin and my computer frame
there is also plenty of stretch out of the spiral chord
finally the aligator clip is plenty strong to hold on tight to the laptop board framei got this because i was getting shocked so hard and painfully by myhorizon fitness t treadmillthat the console would flicker
i bent a paper clip around the area near the heart monitor with pliers then clipped the alligator clip to the paper clip and since then i have never experienced another shock so it is perfect in that regard
the only issue is that with all the sweat flying it has gotten insanely rusty
i let the whole bracelet soak in wd for a few days and it seemed to remove some of the crunchiness but it does still have some redbrown on it
a good idea might be to put a few drops of lube or wd before you ever use it let it dry for a few days then hopefully that will prevent or slow down rustingthe belkin antistatic wrist band is a great bang for your buck grounding strap
ive used it while assembling new computers or working on problem ones with no issues
a low cost necessity when working with electronics
the wrist strap adjusts nicely to different sizes and the clamp secures itself with no issues or slippingused this to build my first desktop computeri clipped it to the ground pipegas pipe next to my work desk and never had a single shockmy house is very dry too and this was a big concernthe bracelet was a little tough to get on right with one hand but once it was on the quick snap disconnect was awesome for every time i had to leave my desk to go get something
handy to have around when doing stuff with sensitive electronicsthis wristband is relatively easy to use and the alligator clip is large enough to clip to most areas so you can attach it close to where you will be working
the only drawback is that the coil extension cord is a little short
but that may just be a preference of mine
works good well priceddoes it work as antistatic
absolutely
just be aware the coils of the cord are wound so tight that it really doesnt give you the distance flexibility that it claims
i wish the cord were a few feet longerfairly comfortable for short term use decent length on the springy cord
i dont know if it helped but i used it to build  pcs and they work great
probably not a necessary buy but better safe than sorry when building  computers
i read on toms that sometimes small notnoticeable shocks can hurt performance without killing the component so probably worth the investmentwell my computer didnt blow up so im assuming it did what it was supposed to
by looking at the build of it and where all the components are it should theoretically work
im not going to test it by trying to destroy my computer and my only gripe is that it was kind of difficult to put on because of the way it was built but i also have large wrists so i approvethis antistatic wrist band makes it safer when working on my computer i gives me peace of mind knowing i wont shock my computers partsbelkin antistatic wrist band with adjustable grounding   this is great for installing memory into my laptops  great for antistatic protectionbought this because i was going to be putting a new pc together which involved a lot of parts moving around
i dont have a good floor for this so the wrist band was a must
id rather not take my chances with having to touch metal every so oftenthe strap fits well and the cord seems to stretch far enough for my needs
however the only problem ive noticed is that the teeth are not as grippy as they could be
ive had them fall off many a time from just reach a few inches past the tower which becomes a bother after the th or th time
oh well it was cheap and it works
cant complain too muchi like it
it works
i put together  computers using it and worked on one other with it on without any electrostatic dischargeinexpensive and simple way to make sure you are not accidentally frying one of you chips when poking around inside your computer
it is easily adjustable to fit my wrist and the coiled cord extends without much force as it shouldit works but the alligator clip can be made so it doesnt scratch the paint or metal when you clip it into somethingthe product works as advertised
if you have large wrist you will have problems to get on
i have average wrist and it worked finebut just barely
the price for value is appropriatethis is cheap and does exactly what it is supposed to do
the button from the wrist strap is nice
the alligator clip is easy to attach to the case
could be a little bit longer thoughi used this when i was changing the ram on my macbook pro
i tightened it around me and clipped it to something metal and there wasnt an ounce of static from me
it was a little awkward having a bungy cord hanging from my wrist though
that being said it is better than having to use that hand to hold something metal the entire time
remember a simple static shock can fry your motherboard and so the small investment in this product is worth it if you will ever be repairing any electronicsif you work on static sensitive electronics then you will need to have one of these
it dissipates static electricity while you are working on electronics
this is a must have tool for you if you build computers
motherboards cpus gpus ssds disk drives memory sticks etc
are all susceptible to damage from static electricity
you can wipe out a  cpu before you even plug it in the socketyou put this onto your wrist and attach it to the metal chassis of the item you are working on
they are a pain to wear but they do have a selfcoiling cord to give you some flexibility
you can adjust it to fit your wrist for comforti own a couple of brands of these and there is one i like better than this one for the comfort factor
for under  this is still good insurance for handling those expensive computer componentsit works it gets the job done
wellmade but a little pricey for what you get
the strap could be    longer it barely fit around my wristi purchased the belkin antistatic strap to help me avoid static shock while working out on my treadmill
it took care of the problem and the strap material and connecting cable appear to be durable and made for the long haul
i am very pleased with my purchasei knew it worked or not lol
so far it has kept all my computer parts working evening while my dumb self was working on carpetwhats to say its an antistatic wrist strapfor those unaware the shocking truth is that electronics are very sensitive to electrostatic discharge esd
it might not seem like it but a discharge too small for you to even notice can be enough to damage a printed circuit board pcbas your body naturally builds up a static charge simply touching the motherboard inside your a computer can discharge several thousand volts of electricity more than enough to cause permanent damage
the damage done can be total computer just never boots again or subtle strange difficult to troubleshoot problems that plague you from then on
an antistatic wrist strap is probably the most common measure used to mitigate the risk of frying your computer when you need to work inside and touch the componentsthe idea is to wear this strap around your wrist which has a metal plate a conductor that makes contact with your skin and attaches to a cable with a metal clip
when you attach the clip to the bare unpainted metal case of your computer or something else metal you effectively ground yourself by making the static electricity discharge harmlessly
you can achieve the same result by simply touching a metal part of the case periodically as you work
not wearing fuzzy socks and scuffing across your carpet on your way to work on your computer on a dry day helps too
there are also other solutions such as antistatic mats for working on as well as ones for standing onwarning some socalled experts will tell you that the whole esd thing is a myth and will tell you theyve worked on computers for years and never used one and not seen a single case of esd if these socalled experts live in humid climates ignore them outright
i dont want to engage in polemics but i will just say that being conscious of esd and taking measures to prevent it from damaging your equipment is a best practice for a reason theres no large mega antistatic bracelet industrial complex profiting from this
however esd damage assuming it exists can be difficult to prove
ive seen two cases of it or at least i think i have
i cant prove it was esd but it seems likely
why risk it
ground yourself and you dont ever have to worry about itanother warning still more socalled experts will tell you that leaving the device plugged in but turned off while you work on it is just as good because the power cord has a ground
well maybe there was something to that argument back in the day but modern electronics very rarely power off fully even when fully off
youll notice glowing led lights on your pc motherboard even with the system fully shutdown for example and that indicates small amounts of power are flowing
i believe working on a system in that state generally not a great practice very easy to short something out in that cramped space by momentarily dropping a screw or not watching where your screwdriver tip isone thing you can do however is ground yourself via the ground in a wall outlet
this strap has an alligator clip which is nice but like all such straps sometimes becomes difficult to find a place where the clip wont keep coming off the case
i discovered that the clip on this strap is removable leaving a plug behind that fits perfectly into the ground hole of a threeprong american power outlet
theoretically this is even better grounding not that this is necessarythis strap also has another nice feature the cable connects to the strap itself via a metal snap button like a coat button
this way if you forget youre attached to the case of your brand new  gaming rig and walk away the cable will hopefully detach at the button rather than pulling your system and all your dream off your bench crashing onto your floorbut these are all pretty standard features
one thing i wish is that the strap itself was elastic rather than velcro
but thats not a big complaint
again this is a pretty basic item but essential in my toolkitgood product for the money
the only complaint i have is that it would be nice to have an elastic arm bandthe strap itself doesnt seem to fit a big wrist very well
i know its supposed to be tight but should be a little more comfortable
other than that its a good quality
and i use it frequentlyi got this for work where i press shirts oddly enough
running my hands across the shirts was creating a lot of static for me and this fit the bill to resolve getting shocked all day
the cords long enough for free movement and the wrist band is easily adjustable
i really liked the fact that the cord snapped off when i had to run do something as wellseems wellbuilt to do the job
a little hard to get on and off but not a real nuisance holds to your wrist securely
the main thing besides drawing off static
which i dont have the electrical equipment to see if it really is doing that
got to trust the manufacturer herepurchased this to use when working on systems i also wanted it so that as i moved around on my chair mat between monitors drafting table external usb devices etc so that i would not have to ground myself each time
the cord is well made
i gave it four stars for one main reason
the stretch cord could be about a foot longer
the clamp works fine and stays on the metal ground i am using
the velcro strap is a tad tight
i am a big guy not heavy just tall
the strap just barely fits my wrist
i would have preffered they use a bungee wrist band but that is getting overly picky for something so cheap
it does the job of keeping you grounded while working on the internal components of anything and does the same as i move around in my chair
my floor pad is not antistatic so just moving around between systems etc builds up a charge
if my chair had any metal on it i would ground it to my chair
i am going to try and run a screw into the bottom of my arm rest and ground it there
if that works i may just cut off the alligator clip and hardwire it to my chair
i will give it a try and post back later if it worksthis antistatic wrist band is worth the money
i just wish the band was elastic instead of velcro
will buy another once this one goes badhard to tell if this is truly needed but its a cheap insurance policy
used for video card installation and will use for new memory upgrade on my desktop systemmy wrists are not big at all
maybe  inch diameter
the strap is just big enough to fit around my wrist comfortably
product does work great though
the clip on the end holds really wellfunctional but not my favorite snagless design
the rubber halfboots over the cable ends interfeer with the removel of this cable
this is not a problem if youre not taking the cable in and out like i do or if you never have the cable in a tight connection like i do
there are better designs like the ones with an additional piece of plastic covering the connection from the opposite directionwhat more can you say
blue cat  cable terminated in two rjs
it works as expected and the price was rightwhat can i say it is what it statesi am a satisfiedthis cable works like i expected it
it came in on time wrapped perfectly and it works great
the price was right tooi dont know how this is supposed to be snagless since it doesnt seem to cover the parts that snag the most often but it works and its long enoughedited to add see above customer image from me for a closeup look at the end of the cable the opposite end is identicalthe only negative thing i have to say about this is that they are not of the greatest quality
the connectors are not snag free and it is possible for the blue outer insulator to slide back after some movement exposing the thin wires
also the outer insulator is pretty thinwith these points in mind the cables work well i have purchased several of them
if changes were made to correct the issues i described you could easily expect them to cost x as much
if you were to wire it and leave it these are great options if you are going to use these will work but will leave you wanting better qualitygood cable for the price
as noted by other users its snagless design can make removing the plugs difficult and the plastic jacket is easy to harm
although neither of these should be of any real problem for everyday useits a network cable it does what it is supposed to do
the price was very reasonable
the color is nicegood sturdy cat cable for a connected lan connection
long enough to fit in those hard to get to spots in your homei ordered it but turned out my laptop port was messed up so did not get much chance to use it
still have it and it seems to work greatprosyellow makes it easy to see in dark spacesits thin enough to not get in the wayafter using it every day for a month its yet to failconnection speeds are what you would expectits dirt cheapwithstands the heat from the back of a ps slimconsthe little locking tabs are sensitive and could potentially break if caught on somethingno snagfree shields to prevent the locking tabs from breaking offitem received in this order was not in good working order and was more difficult to use than the same item previously purchasedtaking care of your discs is very important
and this is a very good set for that
i have used these for years and never had a problemnot much to say about this one
the item works as expected with no flaws or problems
it gets about  hours a day of usedoes the job and reasonably priced at 
using it for a ham radio application and it seems to work well with little extra noise introducednot much to say here
it works for me
i gave it  stars because it doesnt feel as solid as it could but so far so goodthis belkin jack modular t adapter was a perfect replacement to my old twoway phone jack which was already breaking apart and no longer functioning
its perfectly compatible with my att cordless telephone and i havent had any problems with it since i bought it two months ago
this twoway phone jack is a fine product
its cheap and easy to installa twofer for rjs
its kind of tan in color
its got lots of little shiney wire thingys inside of itworks
connected cable modem phone line and printer fax
clicks in secure and jacks fit well
wouldve been astounded if it had not workedjust the thing to stretch that cat two or three more feet
i cant see any evidence of signal or speed degradation from this coupler when used to join two standard cat patch cables
great item to keep in the box of tricksthis is probably the best one available and the only one ive seen that looks like it could be reversed if needed but it is a lot of money if you need many
if you only need one and want it be be the best possible forever connection than this is the one i would buy
if you are connecting many cables than the cheap ones work just as wellits cat  cable as advertised and cheaper than anything else you will find
just the length i needed for wiring part of a small system of networked computers and similar in performance to other cat  cables in the same ecosystem
i dont particularly care for the clips on each jack they are not horrible but are a bit twitchy to plug in and unplug
not a huge deal but the one less than ideal aspect of this cable
cant really complain too much about it for the priceand comparable wire at brick and mortar store was twice the price plus a knowledgeable sales person could not be found outstanding  performance low cost equals the very best deali plugged it in and the ethernet signal passed through it
i dont know what else you could ask from a cablethe ft phone cord supplied with the dsl modem providerwas too short for my installation
extending it with anrj coupler and another phone cord resulted in a configurationwith appreciable soft errors
specifically sagemcoms  providesrecoverable error statistics and a bit error rate testdevice infostatisticsxdslin theory there is no need for rs correctable errorswith a d interleaver depth of  but errors generally accumulate over timethe  supports resetting these statisticsbefore installing belkins modem cablecorrectable errors occurred during xdsl ber test executionafter installation no errors occur during a  second xdsl ber testwhile many things affect actual thruput reducing recoverable errorshas improved this consumers internet experiencei bought this since we get such spotty unreliable speeds from our way oversubscribed dsl provider name begins with cent and ive tried all sorts of attempts to remedy any problems on our end including purchasing this
kind of like hungryman im ocd on trying to make a mediocre situation better
no idea if it improves anything on my end  just cant tell but looks greatagain the biggest problem is both connectors  extremely difficult to unplug from anything anytime
if you have weakness in hands or fingers you might have problems getting outotherwise a cool designedgorgeous looking cablehelped a bit more over the usual phone cable you get with your modem or computer
speed went from  whatevers to  whatevers just with changing the cable outthe only reason i dont give it  stars is that the connection clips seem a little odd or fat
it is now stuck in my cable modem and i cant get it out
otherwise the cable is stiff and beefy so i assume it is providing me with a good signali buy some things i think i need because to be prepared for when i do
so by what u can usei purchased this cable for a brother  bw laser printer because it did not come with one
this one worked just fine
its been used for  months and have had no problems with iti bought this so i could get to the printers settings and set up the wifi
it turned out i didnt really need it because the wps feature worked perfectly
brother hldw compact laser printer with wireless networking and duplexi would buy another another of these cables if i needed onegot this cable to connect from my laptop to my printer
works great and pc had no issues with itgreat product and great price
not expensive and does the job
i am always thwarted by  cables
this is a bit longer than i needed but worth it not to have the hassle with being almost long enough
quick ship and didnt break the bankhavent had it for all that long but it works as it is says on the packaging
great length
shipping and handling was more than the product itselfgreat to have a longer cable so you can separate your devices
works great and seems to be a good qualityfor the price this cable is everything you need
i use it to connect my printer to my pc
the length is great since my printer is on the top shelf of my desk and my computer sits on the floor
the quality is pretty fantastic too as its not flimsy and the ends feel like theyre pretty high quality ie
they snap in well and stay in the female jacks
ive had this cable for around a year and have never had any problems with signal loss or anything like that
the usb end that connects to the pc has a pretty standardlow profile so my other usb plugs can jack in right next to it with no problem
if i needed more id definitely order this againbelkin has never disappointed me in their quality and function and neither does this cable that i use for my printeri am using this cable with a multiuse brother printer
been using it for  months now and it is working perfectly
well builtthe item performs like any other usb  but i wished i had realized it was  long
bulky but works great otherwiseproduct arrived early and packaging was simpleefficent and not excessive
the products work as described and are the perfect length if printer is on a shelf etc
these are a tremendous value but were an addon purchase which means you have to buy more than  in amazon sold products to get the incredible pricegood quality and a good price
belkin is a name i respect because they have always provided a reliable  sturdy product line
this simple usb cable gets the job done nicelyit does the job
it is  feet of hispeed usb  cable lol what more can i say
it worked
didnt need to send it backit does what its supposed to
i lost my printer cable in the process of moving
you can never have too many of these
great price on amazon as usualthe one i have is a little more stylish clear plastic for the cord and clearsilver plastic on both ends
good quality and ive been using it for a couple years nowi bought a few of these belkin hispeed usb  cable  feet for our office use
i bought them because they had a terrific price point
they were all shipped on time they all came individually packaged they all work great and as describedi bought this cord for my hp all in one printer and my roommate bought one for his epson printer
both our cords work perfectly with our printers but they are white in color where i expected them to be black and they are not belkin possibly
they do not come in a belkin cover and they do not say  belkin anywhere on the cord or the plastic cover it came in
apart from this you will be lucky to find such a long usb cord for so cheap
its definitely worth itno problem
works great and is as good as anything in the local stores
i buy most everything on linenot much you can say about a usb cable
its sturdy and of pretty good quality
it works thats what countsbelkin has long been the affordable alternative for more expensive accessories
i suppose there are many ways to mess up a cable but belkin hasnt
completely acceptablewe have had this for some time and it is working fine on the printer
we needed additoinal length to relocate the printer and this cable is filling the billthis cable works as advertised connecting my printer to my computer
be warned about the dirt though
a  foot cable will end up on the floor and attract a coating of dust and cat hair so that you will suffer gnarly yuck on your fingers when you reach for itis it too much to ask that belkin ship these things with a layer of dust repellent installedhey if you are like me and need to have the printer a little further away from the pc then these are the cables to grab
they are  ft in length and still transfer the data between the printer and the pc without issueoverall these are great to have when you need a little extra roomentry level product but very adequate for connecting printer to desktop computer
good quality at a good price
received well packed and sooner than expectedgood product as most i have had fromm belkin are and on here the price was good compared to local stores with the same productwe have a couple of these in the house and its a good product
hooks up to the canon printer easy
i guess it can be used for alot of other thingsit works
ends are secure
nice sheathing but not to stiff
not much else to add about a  cat cable is thereits hard to review this product because its so simple and not a lot of variance on what it can be used for
this does what it says and says what it doesgot the cable on time and at a great price
had an issue i have had with these types of cables before  one of the pins was out of alignment
i have learned over the years to always push gently to connect  never force
when it would not slide into a place a quick inspection yielded an answer to the problem
after straightening the errant pin it connected nicely and has continued to after numerous connectdisconnects as i dock and undock my notebook
if i had no pin problems it would have been five instread of four starsworks as expected i decided to go with this one because belkin is at least a name brand and was worried with a few other on amazon i would get a poorly terminated or cheap connectorthe cable is white in the networking world it is slightly gray  however i used to run network cable at an old job and gray network cable is definitely gray think the color of the bottom of an old nintendo
be aware that in your home it is unlikely the cable jacket will  match your white trim as mentioned by other reviewerswired my blue ray player to allow streaming movies over a reliable network  done 
having part of my network wired allowed the two wireless laptops to be more reliablephone calls dont interfere anymore and function at a n faster network speed
the movies are fine some in hd and rarely fail do to network issues
just treat the cable with respect  do not sharply bend or pull hard
the white color goes with my wallsso far so good its a lot better quality than the other cheap cables ive purchased here no problem with this cable thus farcable was nice
worked well for me for a long time
used it for xbox connection not a big game nerd so the speed was sufficient for methere is nothing outstanding about this cable
it works fine but still it is just a cable
i would expect it to workset up was simple
plug and play
ive been using belkin products for nearly  years
never a problem
recommendedgood price for printer essential item
seeing as how the scum bag printer people are scamming consumers by not including this item this cable is a excellent buy
radio shck sucksthe cable has exactly what i want in a usb cable
the mechanical connectors fit well the cable itself is flexible
i havent done any detailed diagnostics about the signal integrity but ive  noticed no problemsthis is a great inexpensive usb cable
i got it for my printer which is up on a shelf about  away from my deski ordered the  so i would have some more length to play with to travel around the floor and not have the cable be tight across the wall
the downside to this length is well it is long and so when i pulled it out i did not believe it was that long with how tight they had rolled it up  i hooked it up and it was like a phone cord all coiled up so i took it to my deck and hung it in the sun for the afternoon and it relaxed quickly and seemed like a million feet longthe cable is nice and flexible now i was hoping from belkin it would have a little more heft and thickness to the cable it self
it is not ultra thin but i would not pull on it to hard for fear of kinking it and damaging the copper leads
the ends are firmly attached and molded in to the  cable as you would expect and the plugs are within perimeters and fit well in all usb portsoverall i would suggest this to anyone who needed a long cable but if i cold find for a simular price one of those nice clear ones with the heavy braided jackets i would jump on that one insteadworks as it should long enough to move or place where needed
i would reccommend it to anyone needing this type cableucb cables are indispensable items in the st century
you need them quickly
you get them quickly
excellent product excellent service excellent speedneeded something over  feet and this satisfied the need at a great price
unfortunately the printer died from the aftermarket brother cartridge so replaced with a new wireless printeri use this with my pyle pro drum kitits very long so will work in most rooms
unless you live in a churchi experience midi signal loss occasionally but this may be due to the midi drivers and not the cablethis usb cable cannot be longer than this as theres a physical limit to usb cables and its ft
checkthe reach on this cable is great if you need the length
i use this cable to link a portable cooridinate positioning system and laptop computer
the length allows me to move the device around without having to move my laptop also
i would have givin it  stars if it were made of a more flexible rubber type material
the cable is made of a soft plastic like material which is very flexible in warm temperatures like f or higher but under cold conditions the cable gets stiff and hard to uncoil making it more difficult to work with on job sites
electrically the cable works great and fits usb sockets nice and snug
the lack of a california lead hazard warning in the item description is what led me to purchase this cable
its nice to not have to wash hands after each time the cable is handledthis is a great cable if you are cramped on space and need to move your printer to a distant location
works for methis is an affordable cable and it works as it should
ive got it hooked up to my canon printer and have had no problems using it
however i would like to point out that the cable i received was not quite as described
rather than the  ft cable described i got a  ft cable
also it was a differentlooking cable than the one in the picture
it sill works fine and performs the same function
the one star i docked from my score was because of the incorrect discription the product itself is finenot exactly snaglesslacks protective tubingive been buying these cables in various lengths from amazon for the past several years and have not had any issues with any of them and the fact theyre cheaper plus free shipping prime member makes this an even better deal
thanks amazonthis cable is well worth the price
connected my directtv dvr to my computer to enable video on demand
works flawlesslyuse this to connect from my wall to my router
the long cord is very convenient and i have not found any degradation in speed
would recommendi received the cable in a timely manner and it works as it should although it is very stiff
it is advertised as belkin cable but that is not the brand name on the cablethe brand is cmple
in addition it was  long not  as specifiedit worked but with no room to spare
i am satisfied for the price but feel it is misrepresented
when compared to actual belkin cable name on it it is thinner and considerably stiffer the belkin is much  more supplethese cables were the result of a search to locate a usb cable with the lowest voltage drop due to internal resistance
theyve performed well in this regard better than any others ive locatedi bought this product to use with a usb based kvm switch i use to hook up computers i am working on
as such i am constantly connectingdisconnecting one end from various machines and so far it is hold up well
but i would expect nothing less from belkini bought this bc my dsl modem came with a dinky  cable
not enough
this one is great i would have given it four stars if it would have come in lengths longer than 
like  or before installing this product my internet download speeds were always around mbps while my upload speeds were around mbps
after installing my speed test results we much more consistent and always got mbps and mbps on download and upload speeds
its a cheap way to boost your performance a little so i would recommend iti doubt ill ever use all the tools even in this small kit but the ones i have used perform very well
when you need a tool for fiddling with your computer its nice not to have to worry about where its beenthis is a nice little tool set
it may be just a tad bit pricey for the quality of tools but its great to have handy
i keep it in my office because i frequently have to take computers apart
this tool set has everything i would need and more
but basically i just use the phillips screwdriver all the timeas seen in the pic you get  phillips drivers of different sizes  flat head  hex head great for tightening the hex nuts on a vga or dvi port etc
 a chip remover never will use this one a torx driver tweezers and cool little grabbers for screws lost in tight spotsas i said earlier the quality is not something that would warrant use of this tool set beyond typical in a computer environment
they certainly would stand to up to even normal use with a carpenter or mechanic or anything like that
theres no doubt this was made in china for less than a dollar
but if youre looking for a compact tool set to keep handy consider this oneive used everything and all tools are useful
they are a bit cheap but thats exactly what i paid for the kit
handles feel like they will break if i applied to much force but theyre for working on comps so no need for the kind of force that would break them
if youre working on cars or appliances get something else but this kit is great for electronicsa flashlight and antistatic wrist strap would round out the kit nicely but if you have a small maglite type put it with the kit and youll be all seti recently purchased new laptop and wanted to give old laptop to auntbefore i did i wanted to upgrade the old dell inspiron  vista biti purchased an intel processor and gb of memorywith the tools that arrived in just a few days i was able to slap in the new processor and the memoryupdated the os to w and my aunt has been buzzing around with her new laptoptools were great for a novice like myself
i wont be a pc repair tech anytime soon but at least i brought a smile to a family member with their fancy new laptopall of the tools except the icchip grabber is very useful for building a computer or maintaining repairing themthe nut drivers did not fit my case nuts so it didnt do me any goodif belkin has an antistatic wrist band with this kit i would put a fivestar on this producti suppose you cant expect a lot from a tool kit that was under  bucks
the screwdrivers are not going to do any heavy duty work but they are fine for working on computers
i got this for my son as he was building a gaming computer
i would buy it again heck for the moneyit is worth itconvenient but tools arent very durable if used a lot
i like that a few extra tools fit into caseit is a very practical and handy collection of tools in a convenient case which served my need in good orderprosgood selection of toolssturdy for the price at leastcheapconsnone really except for the fact that the plastic parts are a bit cheapi bought this kit to replace my old dollar tree mini screw driver kit that finally broke
i used it to disassemble my hp laptop to clean it out with an air duster
the tools in this kit are very durable and the case it comes with is nice too
so far ive used the small phillips tweezers and screw removalinserter tool
both are very useful to have and made my job a lot easierthe only downside is that this is missing a plastic pry tool
i know that those are mainly used for taking about phones and mp players but some laptops need them as well
i used an old plastic gift card to pry it open but a pry tool would have been much more convenient and efficient
the lack of a pry tool is the only reason i do not give this kit  stars
besides this the kit is a great starter kit for someone who is new to working with computersthis is a cheap and utilitarian basic tool kit
it has just what you need for working on your hardware and nothing more
a couple philips and a couple flatheads with a nice little parts retrieving tool
if you just need an extra kit around its worth it
no frills and not something youll want to use for heavy duty jobs but if youre putting a computer together go for it
you can buy more expensive computer tool kits but they tend to mostly come with a lot of additional pieces that youll never use like a memory chip removersetter
when was the last time anyone needed thatall you need right in one place
great
will keep this information for any further computer related purchases also electronic helpjust bought this kit recently to put my new gaming pc together
its a pretty nice kit to have
the two phillips screwdrivers are useful although they could be higher quality
when really torquing the screws into the plastic on my fans the screwdrivers got stripped out a little the screw was stronger than the screwdriver
they are good sizes though and for anything that doesnt give a ton of resistance i ended up using my cordless drill for those fan screws so they werent easy to screw in they work wellmost of the other tools wont be used much if ever but one tool really stood out
the screw pickerupper thingy was extremely useful
i was able to get into hard to reach areas and start the screws in the motherboard holes with only one hand which was very very handy
it wouldve taken me at least another half an hour to screw in the motherboard without this toolthe main downside is that i think it should have come with the antistatic strap and ditches some of the other less useful tools to keep the price the same
an antistatic strap is absolutely necessary and some of the other tools in the set are pretty useless so i wouldve preferred one of those to come with the kit
all in all i think this kit was a good buyagain got this for any repairs i needed to do pc wise for family members
got the same kit at work and its greatshipped promptly as ordered and a good price
what more could you askperhaps you could ask for a vendor who cares enough about their reputation to nicely solicit an earned recommendationwell action packaged inc you got itthe day care lady said the bottles needed to be labeled and i balked at shelling out  for fancy online labels
a little hunting around lead me to this tape
i made up a bunch of labels and stuck them to the bottles and theyve stayed stuck going on three months now
during that time theyre regularly immersed in water for hours at a time and spend a couple minutes each day in a steam sterilizer they do not though go through the dishwasher
during this time they have by and large held fast
a couple corners on  out of  pieces have pulled up a tiny bit but by and large everything is sticking tightone thing though this tape does not have the crack back feature
you have to peel off the backing the slow hard way and i got so frustrated i nearly threw the whole thing in the trash
my wife was able to get the backing off thoughoverall this is a great way to save a few bucks for this particular applicationi just want to add that since the review was written we have been sending the bottles and lids through the dishwasher and the tape has held up astoundingly well
none of the labels have pulled off and the couple corners that have pulled up a tiny bit have not pulled up anymore
these labels have been through the dishwasher over  times and theyre still sticking fantastically
this tape is a great producttheyve stopped making polaroid film and the expected final availability according to polaroids web site is the first quarter  at this point in time id think the main interest would be in artistic work with the film
check the expiration dates and get some before the era comes to a complete closepoor quality control
ive had multiple sets of these over the years and actually prefer them to some of the more expensive ratcheting type crimpers
this last set however had a poorly installed die so the teeth didnt line up when crimping on a connector
i just pulled the dies off and stuck them on my old handles
works great that wayim a whiz at the fourwire telephonestyle tools similar to this
but i just couldnt seem to get things to work properly when crimping new rj cable ends
the tool itself is wellmade so i suspect its operator errorno complaints
does what i need it for
for the price you cant beat itthis product does what is advertised just fine it crimps wires
i didnt want to sped a lot of money because this is just for my own house where i needed to crimp a few cables
for this it worked well
the cables work and i havent noticed any performance issues with the resulting plugs
it also has little wire strippers and the like so you dont really need any other tools to get the job done
however the outer insulator stripper that is built into the crimper seems to cut the wires too short whenever i used the preset length the wires did not extend all of the way into the plug
luckily the product never really claimed to strip the outer insulator so for the overall value of the product it isnt too much of an issuei would recommend this crimper for anyone doing a simple residential job but having no experience with professional installations i have no idea how this would hold upi ordered the fellowes custom mail order keyguard keyboard sealskin twice once for mydell dj bluetooth keyboardand once for mydell bluetooth keyboardi should caution you that it can take a couple of months or more for your custom keyboard skin to be delivered  if it gets delivered at all
it took almost three months 
before my first custom mail order keyboard skin finally arrived in the mail
and when it did i was ecstatic
my second mail order however was a washout  it turned out that my dell bluetooth keyboard wasnt supported
and hey it took the good people at fellowes only two months to notify me of the problem amazon promptly gave me a refund after i notified them of the problemheres how the mail order process worksafter you have placed an order with amazon you will be mailed a fellowes keyguard keyboard sealskin mail order form that you have to fill out and mail back to fellowes
you will be asked to fill out the model number of your keyboard the number of keys on it  for a standard keyboard for example and of course your name and delivery address
next keep your fingers crossed that  your keyboard is supported  your keyboard skin will arrive before a catastrophic spill ruins your keyboard and  youll be promptly notified if your keyboard isnt supportedthe silicone skin is very thin and doesnt interfere with typing  it feels almost as if the skin isnt even there
if you dont mind the lengthy wait minus  star this skin works very well for protecting your keyboard from dust and spillspersonally i prefer using a sharpie to label my babys clothes but my wife is into the whole label maker thing and labels everything thats his
sooo i went and got this product
it does what its supposed to do but be remember that any iron on adhesive will eventually fail after time
otherwise i like the labelsi used to connect my hard drive and camera and computer with this cable
it did its job well and we eventually replaced hd with one of the new usb
i still owe it but rarely used in past  yearnot much to say
its a cable
works just fine
all firewire cables are pretty much the same
this on is nice and cheap especially if you have amazon prime to give free shippingi just needed a short cable for streaming video
its a good heavy duty cable and works just fine
no dropping of frames that ive experienced
however i recently found  for all cables
bought a bunch of really nice cables  for under 
very highly rated by nearly all buyers
check it outdoes the trick not exactly compact or easy to store but for what i needed it for it worked wellthis cable replaced a new cheaper one that would not stay connected
the materials that make up the belkin are of very good quality the cable works flawlesslyi ordered this to help me transfer video from my camcorder to my laptop its an older camcorder and uses tapesanyway it works very well however its important to note that the cable is pretty stiff and since i ordered the  variety that means that there is not a lot of length to allow for tight bendswhich means that you could probably damage the ports on the device you are connecting to if you arent carefulno complaints other than that
works like it should
i just wish the cable was more flexiblei used this cable to connect my camcorders dv out firewire port to my dvd recorders dv in port
it should work with any sony camcorder thats ilink capable
i dont know about other brands
it works fine
i give it four stars because i havent had it long enough to know how well it will hold up
it seems reasonably well madei bought this cable to tranfer video files from my jvc camcorder to my laptop through  link
it works nice but i think if it had noise filters the quality may be better
anyway im quite satisfied with this cable in quality and valuethe old adage of you get what you pay for holds true with the sandisk imagemate
i bought it only because of its low low price and the fact that i had a  gift certificate
i read everyone elses review and found it to be just as described by the others
the sandisk web page is not at all useful
with as many systems being shipped today with windows me installed youd think there would be a section covering me problems
nope not a word about this thing working with methe software drivers that ship with this unit are of course outdated so after trying to get the imagemate to run and being unable to find it on my usb system i downloaded the new drivers and found the patch for the adaptec software conflict
i installed it again per the instructions after of course removing it from my system and it fired right uponce again getting what you pay for the construction of the imagemate is kind of cheap
the compact flash does not gently slide into the media slot instead you have to kind of push jiggle and hope that it goes in properlyit seems to be working properly im not getting any conflicts or inablity to read my cf
i only have mb cards so i cant testify how it will work with higher capacity or with a sm adapterall in all not a bad deal for less than   just a bit of install hasslethe sandisk card reader is a good product for any mac user with a usb connection
at first i had experience some problems with the reader i had deleted images from the card but it was not freeing up memory but after i downloaded and installed the latest drivers from sandisk all my problems went away
the ease of use of this product was quite simply astounding
when you place a card in the reader it will appear on your desktop assuming you use a mac as any floppy disc or cd would
from there you can copy the files to your hard drive by just dragging and dropping them into any folder on your computer
when youve done that just drag the files from the card to the trash and empty it
voila
you have just cleared the space off the card
it really is simplicity in motion
i highly recommend this easy to use productit certainly downloads the images quickly
i do wish that i could run it through my usb hub instead of having to connect it directly to my cube
nice product for the price thoughi am using this daily as a hardwired bridge between my modem and switch
it does the job very well and seems to be a very quality cable
cant go wrong with belkin cablesawesome price beats the walmart price of  for same cable but with fancy packagingworks as advertised
a common flaw in these hubs is the power cord exits the same side as the usb ports so can interfere a bit
if you dont use them for constantly pjugging and replugging it isnt an issuei bought this one thinking it was like the one my computer equipment is plugged into
only difference is the one i have has an input and output for telephone
i bought it for new tv and stereo equipment in living room as i had a cheap surge protector
i will probably use this one on bedroom tv and buy the right one next time for living room
want to have protection on phone jack for satellite receiver
i like the design on these and you can plug everything into it and feel fairly certain a power surge or lightning strike wont take out all your equipment
their warranty  and customer service as other people have noted are the best
would recommend this productit has served me well since year  to  however the hex ring is of poor construction
actually the wrench set survives to be of use today but honestly no one changes chips on their motherboards now so its quite an outdated setthis kit includes all of the basics for pc repair and even has a container for spare parts and has space available for you to add your own things in there
its large enough such that i could add a few of my own tools precision screwdriver pen light pencil and secures things pretty nicelyafter many months of owning this the screwdriver pits have begun to poke holes intear the elastic that secures them in place and the elastic holding in the case for parts has stretched out a bit and doesnt hold them in place very well anymorethe kit is otherwise very good and the tools are of fair quality
i would certainly buy this kit again even if just for the toolsi am an independent contractor for computer repair and this kit is more than adequate
i do wish i had purchased the magnetized kit instead thoughthe tool selection is ok now the quality of the driver is definitely lacking it has a ball that is used to retain the bits the ball kept falling out causing the bit to also fall out
the vendor offered to replace it but can see its a cheap design i just got a better driver from craftsman and use for the rest of the kit
the only other thing i wish the anti static strap was a little longer so could also put on my ankle and out of the way but it is a wristsrap after all so cant fault them for thatgreat product for the price
all the tools and more that i need and organized so i always know if im leaving something behind
not snap on quality but great for the pricethis is a great little kit
it has everything you need for most types of computer repair as well as upgrading components
all of the components have been demagnetized which is nice
a good value for the pricei really like this kit and only have one complaint there could be a larger range of choices for socket sizesif you dont already have a decent set of small demagnetized tools this is a good starter set
most of the tools are useful with only a couple of throw away items
the only downside is that the wire cutting tool i think is supposed to be sort of a combo tool which makes it difficult to use to cut a lot of things
dont waste a lot of time trying to use them just grab your trusty wire snips from the garage and use that for things such as cable ties etcthe tools seem sturdy
its a good basic kit with some extras
i read the tools will rust if given the opportunity so keep them inside with the electronics
if youre curious yes the folder is made of plastic and the pliers have a springthe tool set contains everything you need to work on solid state circuit boards
nicely laid out and easy to use
demagnetization is a real plus
i recommend itthe linksys usb hub has worked without incident with several devices attatched
it is small enough to even pack in my briefcase if needed nice rubber feet on the bottom to ensure it stays where you want it even with a little pullas another user commented the leds are a bit confusing i dont really pay attention to them but nonetheless confusing
other than this i found no annoying issues with the productinstallation was a breeze as with most usb devices no extra software needed and the users guide was very straightforwardoverall i rate the linksys usb hub  stars because of its simplicity and excellent performance along with its confusing ledsi find the ergonomic keyboard extremely easy and comfortable to use
however the paint used on the keys begs for improvement
within a short period of time the more used keys completely lose their markings which leave something to be desiredheadphones are terrific
sound quality is great
a little tight but with a little adjustment they are very comfortable
will be using them at texas motorspeed way in nov  the stereo mono switch is nice feature
will also use them when i am using my backpack blower instead of just earplugsi bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments
they block the majority of noises including traffic people yelling stereotelevision noise from next door
they wont block out loud noises in the same room eg
loud tv or person yelling but i think thats good because you want to be aware of dangers nearbyim no audiophile but the sound that comes through these headphones sounds just like the quality that comes out of my stereothey fit a little differently from most headphones with the connecting bar fitting behind your head rather than sitting on the top of your head
i dont know if this would affect people who wanted to use these headphones while moving eg
commuting or exercising but for those of us sitting down while wearing them they are very comfortablei will echo vanderreviewers comments about this headset
they dont cancel the roar of my deere but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while i mow
it takes some adjustment to get it to fit comfortably over a ball cap and sunglasses if not youll notice some discomfort after an hour or so
lucky vanderr my lawn takes  hours on a good daythe reason i got these was to listen to some music on while using my riding mower
i guess the original main purpose for these headphones was to be able to communicate in loud environments
the mids and highs are pretty goodthe lows seem to drop off around  cycles
ive compensated somewhat with the equalizer on my ipod touch but i can never get a truly deep bassthe bottom linefor my needs bouncing around on a riding mower they work good enough
the cord is too long and bulky im considering shortening it
the fit is fineespecially if you want to wear a hat
the volume control is a major plus
with decent bass they would have been greatthese work great but are made to fit tight over the ears to keep out surrounding noise
i gave them to my grandson and ordered myself some lighter ones for myself that i like much better
these also have a strange bar and strap to keep them firmly in place which would make them ideal for moving around a lot or bending overhandy little tools for working on electronicsa lot of these kits are over burdened with tools that you will honestly never need
ive found this to be perfect not just for fixing pcs but also for fixing up electronics in general
the soldering iron is cheap and without a casethe first time i used it it looked like it was going to burst into flames before it finally settled down and somewhat annoyed no stand came with it
the rest of the products work greatsince it was impossible for me to find an exact list of the products here you goscrew driver handle with various bitssoldering ironneedle nose plierswire cuttersmall screw driver and bits in the blue casewide tongsnarrow nosed tongsallen key setlong narrow screw driverrazor knifecable cuttercrimpervarious hex socket wrench bitsgrabber tooldusting brushand last but not least the most worthless flashlight you will ever see
seriously take the batteries out and put them in a good flashlight you buy yourself then take this pos and use it to play fetch with your dogi think i missed a few but they are just fluff pieces i havent had to usethe quality of the tools are strong and durable and the only way they could be better is if  of the screw drivers was magnetized to help retrieve the screws but not the end of the worldthis took kit is not bad
it has a lot of things that i did not have all in a handy case that is attractive and will be able to easily accommodate replacement tools as the originals wear out
i have to agree with many people about the flashlight
it is a piece of junk
it does not even have an onoff switch
you have to unscrew the light bulb holder part to turn it on and off and if you dont unscrew it enough i guarantee that your batteries will run down very fast
if you are a professional you will probably feel like this is junk but if you are just wanting to fix your own laptop this will give you the tools that you needi really like this little kit
i have been using it for about a month it contains what i need majority of the time
i did replace the flashlight with a mag lite
i would recommend this kit in general its a good computer maintenance took kitthere are a few things that i had to upgrade in this kit
the flashlight solder and screwdriver needed a magnetized one i also added zip ties
other than that the kit is awesome and has a lot of the tools a computer tech would needbelkin piece computer tool kit with black casei have use this kit on a regular bases for my electronic kitsworth the price the quality of the toolshowever the soldering iron is not all that good id recommend getting something a bit more professional other than thatthe tools available are pretty much standard and covers your basic needs
at least in my casei love the kit
the only thing i wish it included was the third hand to assist in soldering
other than that the kit is greati rated this a  stars because some of the tools slip out of their holsters very easily
but it does come with a lot of useful tools that i use almost everydaygood basic electronics toolkit the soldering iron and flashlight both leave a lot to be desired but other than that a good basic electronics toolkit to have around the homeofficenice arrangment of tools
didnt give it  stars because the screw driver handle is little bulky
but thats not a big problem reallythis is a great kit for the hobbyist
i think professionals would prefer a kit that is a little more robust better insulation metal however this would still get the job done
the only thing that would be nice to add is a desoldering pumpthe soldering iron works for simple jobs but i wouldnt say its high quality the tip is wearing out after its first use and you cant hold the iron where youre supposed to during use because it get a bit hotthe flashlight is pretty poor quality i scrapped mine and replaced it with a better one
the solder wick is a nice bonus and works just fine
all the other tools are good and the nut driver is selectable ratcheting and fits well in the handi have been using this kit for over six months now and its been a nice and convenient kiti am a computer service technician and i use this case every single day
everything inside of it works great
somethings i would like to see included are extra blades for the exacto knife and some small screws would have been useful
i also have to mention the case feels a bit flimsy i could see this being a problem if i was traveling with the case a lot
but i keep it right in my shopnot a bad little tool kit for the 
the picture is out of date however there is no solder included anymore
i suspect this is due to some treehugging lead warning nonsense
like some of the other reviewers have stated the penlight included looks like a toy from the s and should be replaced by a minimag or other quality penlight i swappedin an led penlight
if youre creative you can cram a few extra tools in the case
i was even able to fit a small shirtpocket style multimeter in the casegreat product by belkin everything that you need is n here
the only thing that i dnt like is the soldering iron but overall is outstandingthis kit comes with everything you need to start repairing computers
the only down side is the kit comes with a cheap flashlight and soldering iron with no ledcable arrived as promised cable is obviously well made i like the large thumb screws
belkin has been around a long time and it shows in their workmanshipthe desktop is new to my other desktop but the second monitor is nearly on the other side of the room
this worked just finegenuine apc replacement battery which is what i was looking for
i have purchased third party replacement battery and they dont last more than a yearthis works well so far for  month
i will wait and see if it last beyond  yearit is possible to download a windows xp driver for this device
however you really dont need one
i tried the touchpad with the xp driver and without and found that the preinstalled generic xp driver provided smoother cursor motion
of course if you want all the special glidepoint features you need the xp driver from the fellowes web site but i found the glidepoint features to be more annoying than helpful and the cursor motion became somewhat unpredictable
i recommend just hooking this device up to your windows xp machine and letting the preinstalled xp home edition driver do the work
if you do youll find that this touchpad functions exceptionally well and is a great value for the money  much better than those combo keyboardtouchpad devices which are harder to use and less ergonomically satisfyingthis is a factory replacement battery for an apc ups
it is a piece of cake to install and fits my unit perfectly
it is shipped in a very nice molded styrofoam protected box to ship undamagedwould a nonfactory lessexpensive equivalent done as well
probably but i did not want to take a chance because this was for my work
my hunch is that if you order an offbrand battery with the same electrical specs and same terminals and same or slightly smaller dimensions youll be finei have ordered generic replacement sealed leadacid batteries before without any problems
the only negative i encountered with generics is that they were not packaged well and had little chips of plastic banged off some of the corners
not enough damage to effect performance but you might want to inquire about your vendors shipping containerworks like a battery
this is a replacement for the original battery of the same type that lasted  years
three years was the expected lifetime for the battery
would be nice if the battery lasted longer
the free return shipping for recycling the old battery is goodhad no problem installing these replacement batteries and they are an excellent value
had to recycle the old batteries separatelyi have looked at the others even bought a different one when i mistakenly thought it wouldnt work on an xp machine
i much prefer this style of keypad to the flat wafer looking ones on the market
for anyone used to a regular adding machine style calculator layout this is the best one ive seeni think i have an older model but it looks exactly like this one
it says its a kunow a usb hub would be a cool addition to it but ill sacrifice it for the ergonomicsworks great easy to use no complaints except i wish there was some indication of when the number lock was on or off
a little light maybewhen i was   years ago i was hired by my next door neighbour to stain her garage
with my profits i went headphone shopping
for around  to  bucks canadian i splurged on a pair of koss proaa headphones
wow
great bass terrific highs fine midrange
i was in love with the sounds enveloping my head
at that time there was no better headphone in its price range
i still remember when i was  and in my first semester of university and was listening to the first album by deep purple with the phones on while reading jane austins emma sprawled out on the chesterfield
them was the daysa lot has happened since then
i not only finished reading jane austins emma but i actually finished college a few times got a job and along the way purchased some other cans sennheiser  grado sr and a pair of akg s
i have an ipod clone and a total bithead headphone amp
i use my cans on my regular stereo kit with an adcom  preamp headphone outlet
each headphone has its virtues and warts
i enjoy them all but usually listen to the akg s i listen to a lot of jazz folk world music but also other genres as i teach courses like the sociology of music and popular culture for a livingreevaluating my koss proaas im surprised at how good they sound for a pair of  year old headphones
they are still involving good overall sound with excellent sound isolation and a snug viselike fit
if the darn things werent so robust read a pain in the neck after a while as they are rather heavy and so tight id probably use them more often
ive been spoiled by the competition and with the exception of the grado srs paid substantially more for the other cansthe sound of the proaas is pretty well balancedsome over emphasis of bass but that isnt displeasing and is oftentimes welcome it isnt super accurate like the akg s phones which excell in monitoring music studio use and mixing
the bass does get a bit muddy and the overall sound presentation isnt as smooth as the akg s and the sennheiser   the midrange of the akg s is hard to beat
the midrange on the proaas holds its own but is not as smooth and detailed at the akg
in some ways the proaas are more musical than the akg s
the proaas are fun to listen to and are very good
the akg s is much more accuate and for me a better phone for critical listening when i really want to dissect a song
in a sense the proaas are like good home stereo speakers the akg  sounds like studio monitor speakers
both have their place in the world but if its a party go with the koss proaas
if you are into analysis or studio work go with the akg si still like the proaas and listen to them every now and then
if you want sealed cans and are on a budget youd get an excellent bang for your buck with these headphones
if you dont mind leaking sound the on the ear grado srs are a delight
if you have the lolly and really want an accurate pair of sealed headphones the akg s is well worth it dont bother with the mkii version as it really isnt all that different than the original version and is much more expensive
if you just want a pair of musical and involving headphones and want comfort go with the sennheiser s
still for a lot less you can get the proaas and if you are a casual listener the weight and the viselike grip shouldnt be a detriment years later the koss proaas are still viable and a very good pair of cans that can still kick the jamsi think the koss proaa headphones were the phones of choice for noah on his ark  theyve been around a long time
and contrary to some longstanding products that stick around in spite of newer more technically advanced competitors simply because a bunch of eccentrics swear by them these phones are a fabulous choice for anyone at any timeand now the pros and conscons heavy heavy heavy
watch your neck if you have a large head these phones can give you headaches as the headband design puts a lot of pressure on your temples and ears the coiled cord has a tendency to increasingly pull on one side of the phones as you get closer to its length limit
that this starts to happen around the halfway point is troubling not a stylish set of phones
almost retro in appearance
the ill green color could have been changed long ago the earpieces circumaural seals are filled with air and will deflate if punctured
this is the achilles heel of the phones the cord cannot be easily replaced
if you get a short youre done forpros superior extended frequency range
clean and flat
still the best sounding phones i have heard in their price range
sounds as good as phones that go for twice the price circumaural closed design holds in the thunderous bass and stifles the outside world still the choice of many professionals
its amazing how many djs continue to use this model the price is outstanding for the quality of sound delivered built like a tank
my first pair lasted ten years of constant use
they never did break down i replaced them for another reason
for a home system this is a fine set of cans
if you want something portable look elsewhere
consider buying a cord extension too if you plan to sit somewhere else besides right near your stereo
and let people know that with them on youll be in your own musical world for a while
sit back and enjoygreat durable headphones
the weight felt heavy for a while but my neck became accustomed to it after a few days and now i  barely notice it
has good built in sound dampening and great sound
i would give five stars if it came packaged with a quality adapter for use with a small headphone jack generic adapters dont work great and will cause static and sound loss when barely touchedthe sony mdrv monitors are an overall good headphone i gave a review about the sonys and felt there was a lack of feeling in the headphone sound its like the sound is designed
i really felt that this is where the koss proaa standout
i wont deny the fact that although the proaa headphones wont sound perfect to the average ear the sonys sound good across the board
it could be the fact that the proaa headphones encase my ears yet its hard to describe the sound from these headphones sound rich and real doesnt feel artificial
the main reason i purchased these headphones was due to their durable design and lifetime warranty but also heard about their noteworthy history and lifespan
i am looking forward to breaking in these headphones and burning some work hours with themwill reedit after hrsi was pleased to see these headphones are still in production
i owned a set in college some time ago
they are every bit as good now as then
i only wish the material used as the ear cups were a bit more comfortable
they are made of a thick plastic that doesnt breathe at all
the result is ear sweat and a sticking sensation on the ears which can limit how long you can have them in operation
most of the time this doesnt bother me but there are other timesthey are heavy too
this is not an issue with me
also be prepared to run to radio shack to get a cord extension since the coil is stiff and doesnt extend too far
also you might consider getting an adapter so the headphone can be used with a smaller plug for an ipoddont let the negatives keep you from purchasing
i would do it all over again to enjoy the superior sound and the clarity these headphones providethese phones are absolutely amazing
i no longer own a pair of these i have a smaller pair of koss headphones but had them from  and finally updated them about  years later
now the plus is that they block out sounds very effectively
cueing up a record was easy in a noisy environment yes i used records mostly at that time lol
the problem with me was that i have a large head and they tend to squeeze a bit
but they didnt move
also if youre in a warm or hot area and perspiring your ears can get pretty wet in you cant take them offno breathing under these thingsone warning the bass can be so strong you dont have to have your audio adjusted like that it can actually make your ears hurt and you dont even realize how loud it is since the sound is so clean
please be carefulthe reason i finally got rid of them gave them away is that the ear cushions had hardened due to age
i think at that time the cushions were hard to come by and rather expensive
decided to just stop using them insteadbuy theseif you find them comfortable youll like emi got these as the second warranty replacement for my discontinued koss akoss initially sent me the proaat
they were terribleon the other hand the proaa sound almost as good as i remember my fathers soundedgood clarity could be better good dynamic range good imaging good basses good midrange good highsbuild quality leaves lots to be desired they look cheaply made the foams under the ear cushions are in different places from one side to the other
the piece that has the hinge pivots is poorly molded and it is almost cutting sharpkoss sent them as i said before as warranty replacement
they were in a box that badly deformed the head band
after reshaping the the head band they fit comfortably with just the right amount of pressure on my headears
even though they are on the heavy side i can listen comfortably for hoursi would recommend them to my friends with a warning about the build qualitythe resistance on these are not compatible with thins like mp players or iphones
obviously you need a converter to put these in the external output for small devices
the output will not be enough to work these wonderful headphones
these units are made to plug into a receiver with the same size female plug
then you listen to one of the best set of headphones ever
put on these with an extension cord turn off the lights and listen to music like you have never heard like this before
yes they are that goodi bought these headphones so i could hear what im recording versus the volume of the performance
im using them to record a variety tv show
the bistro is large but the actual performance space is tight
the pa system is ceiling mounted
im running up to a fourcamera shoot
all of the audio is coming to my mixer from mics in the room and an audio feed off the board
what i need most is isolation so i can hear my mix versus the room sound
the plastic cups around the drivers on this gear are intense
these headphones were recommended to me by two professional audio engineers
they have a long reputation as the choice of radio broadcasters
i expect them to perform and they do
so thats the plus now heres the minus the color is puke green
why koss
its 
they dont come with an adapter to th inch mini jack
finally i could not get them out of the box
the box is a threepart affair
the plastic sleeve was easy to remove
pulling the cardboard frame out of the paper box was impossible
finally i had to cut the paper box along one seam to get it off the cardboard frame in which the headphones are mounted
the problem with this is you cant return them if the packaging is damaged and getting them out of that packaging requires that you destroy it
i find this kind of scenario dishonest
these headphones are known for their ability to last
if they dont im going to return them and raise holy hades with koss all because i had such a hard time getting them out of the boxthese things have been around literally since color tv was invented
i use them in the s in the radio biz doing top  nighttime screaming radio and we blasted these things
it is impossible to blow these out but  and this is a big but the wiring sucks or at least did
the speaker cones and audio drivers are built like a tank but the wiring was made by mattel
they always developed shorts and only the chief engineer could rewire it
not for the faint of heart
but even after a repair they always went down again
people were always taping the cords in a position that temporarily solved the problem but it was always a pain in the ass
i hope koss has fixed this problem  otherwise it would have  starswe have distinctive ring service on our phone line the line has a second number associated with it when that number is dialed the phone rings but with a distinctive shortshort burst rather than the normal ring
this device allows us to use this second number as a dedicated fax number
it senses the distinctive ring and routes the call to a fax machine or in our case to a desktop computer that also receives faxes
when the phone rings normally the call is not reroutedwe can pick it up or our answer machine will if we dont
we have found the device very reliable over a months use once set up you can forget it it just works
im not sure how
it is connected to one of three extension jacks for this number the answer machine and another phone are on a second line but this is no problemit has one important limitation the only distinctive ring it can sense is the shortshortour phone company also offered other options
if you chose another option you have to revise that choice to the shortshort ring for this device to work
the device also requires programming to align it with your setup
it comes configured for a setup in which there is no distinctive ring service
in that case the device apparently senses whether the incoming call is from a fax machine or is a voice call and responds appropriately
i have no experience with that function
to set it up for my situation i had to call the support line as i was not successful using the instructions that came with it
but the support line worked ok there was very little wait and i got someone who was able to help with little difficulty
a more convenient programming set up is all the device needs for a five star rating in my estimationif you have a fixed location this should do the trick the extra wires with a laptop can be a painswitching from the phone to the computer is a little awkward at times especially with the mute functionusing this with intertel phones and plantronics headsets
sound quality is great connections werent an issue follow the cabling requirement guidesthis is professional grade office equipment not a consumer product which is part of the reason for the price
it goes between the base and handset so only works with modular connector handsets not mini jacks used for cellphone headsets and includes a variety of adjustments that allow the amplifier to be matched to the particular telephones electronics
ive been using my mx for over a decade during which time many of my other computers and gadgets have come and gone
ive moved it with me from office to office and through phone system upgrades attaching it to a halfdozen or so different brands of office phones and it continues to work well even with the latest generation of cisco ip phone to which i have it attached todayto use this amplifier you will also need to buy a plantronics headset with plantronics proprietary quickrelease connector again not the mini plug used on cellphone handsets
contrary to some comments here this is standard for plantronics headsets designed for officecallcenter use
as with this amplifier you get what you pay for  these are not inexpensive headsets but are high quality and durableas a switching headset amp it works quite well allowing both headset and microphone to be switched between telephone and pc duties
conveniently the amplifier mixes both sources so you can hear your pc and your phone call at the same time your callers cant  that means if you have your headset on for your pc when the phone rings you just pick up the handset or press the phones answer button depending on the phone and start talking no fiddling with the amp itself
sound quality for calls is good for listening to music from the pc not so much  this is an amplifier for telephone headsets not a music player
ive found it entirely acceptable for voip calls mainly used with microsoft lync but have also tested it with skype
i am aware of the equipment hum problem that this unit can have apparently a problem with inadequate shielding when used around electronic devices like modern office phones
 but have found that slightly relocating the unit andor its cables resolves the issuei guess its showing its age but the mx remains the best overall solution ive found to this one headset for office phone and pc problem and its very convenient if a tad pricey
given the growing prevalence of voip solutions and placing calls directly through pcs we may not see much improvement in this category
though its just about perfect at its intended mission i only rate it four stars because  i think they could fix the hum problem with a little engineering effort instead of making me fiddle with equipment positioning and  its  and well past time for an updated version that provides highfidelity sound through a standard pc headsetmic jack but im not holding my breaththis battery set cost me only about  what a real rbc replacement set from apc would have cost
while the ratings printed on the side of the cells were the same as the original apc cells the cells did not appear to be quite as substantial  i elected to reuse the fuse strap from the original rbc rather than the one shipped with the replacement because it was of thicker gauge
the replacement set has ridden through several power outages since i installed it and did its job just fine
time will tell whether the cases will leak or have other aging problems
at the moment i am satisfied and would probably opt to purchase this replacement battery set againgood cable that feeds cleanly out of the box and is clearly marked in onefoot increments for easy measuring
couldnt give it a  star rating because of the lightness of the coloring on the striped wires
once you separate the twisted pairs finding the bluewhite vs the greenwhite cable is a bit of a challenge if you didnt keep them close to their matei wish i had bought a cdrw sooner
no issues installing it on my win kwin dual boot machine or
i had more problems figuring out what was the slavemaster setting on the preinstalled dvdsoftware is that it assumes you already had a cddvd
the installation program comes on cd but wasnt an issue for mesoftware included is adaptecs easy cd creator 
i wish it came with version  or a discount for the upgrade i want to make video cds
it also comes with direct cd which makes a cdrw like a second hard drive with delete and rename capabilitiesi bought this cdrw over a year ago when i was still running windows
it was pretty wacky then doing all sorts of things to my discs and the os
dunno it thats the software or whatanyway last fall i switched my computer over to linux and this burner has worked like a charm
linux users note mandrake and suse both recognize this flawlessly
the program cdrecord will recognize it but wont let you use dao however the app cdrdao works great with it and its frontend gcdmaster
ive burned over  discs with this burner ive bet and only a handful have been losers and out of those i bet only  or  were due to things beyond my control
cheap discs dont get cheaper then pengo i bet pricey discs all burn very well  some faster than others the blacks are the slowest at x tdk or fuji the fastest
i would buy iomega products againive used a lot of different cd burners and several different cdburner software packages
i use this iomega cdrw drive in my home computer and it works fine
there are a few cheap brands of cds that it does not burn reliably and occaisionally the cd burn software flakes out and requires rebooting but frankly most midrange cd burners i use have these same problems
i wouldnt buy it for a business that required frequent burning but it is fine for my home use
ive used it under win for a while nowi was able to burn an audio cd in  minutes at x using a celeron 
 minutes for an audio cd on a cdrw at x
the burner is quiet too unlike my sisters yamaha cdrw
as for being burnproof while using the burnproof technology i thought i would be able to surf the net
i was wrong
my pc froze and therefore created an incomplete cd
this is the only reason why it did not get a  star rating
also i use nero  not ez cd creator
i like it a lot betterthis monitor was a real deal considering a lot of other monitors that have the same tube technology and technical ratings or less cost a whole lot more
see lg electronicsi just bought this monitor and find that it was more than i was looking for
quot is a real increase in screen space for me but too often i find that this does not mean high qualitythis samsung df monitor is worth every penny
i just hope they do not get smart and lift the pricei need to save money and i am glad that i choose thisas a computer monitor the mp is very easy on the eyes with good and adjustable color rendition contrast and brightness
the viewing angle is about as wide as it getsalmost on par with apples overpriced  inch not only does the brightness not fade but there is little color shift
there really isnt much to say as it performs as well as i would want it tooas a video monitor it is lacking
i have fed it with satellite and dvd signals using both the s video and rca inputs no real difference in viewable quality
at default settings the picture was grainy and had the same sort of problems i associate with over sharpening on digital images
the major tweaking i did was to turn down the sharpening using the nicely designed menu system
this made the picture soft but to me far more acceptableplease note i have not tried the built in tuner as i dont have a good antennae to hook it up to
i just tried satellite and dvd feeds
i use a samsung hdtv  inch quottvquot which has an incredibly good picturetry this beffore you spend the extra money on sony philips panasonic et al so i am comparing it to a very good benchmark
however i think that it should have the circuitry inside it to produce a video image that is as good as my last tv did
compared to the hdtv which is upconverting the feed the mp was lacking in brightness contrast resolution and blackness
this seems odd because it really does look great wide contrast range good blacks etc
as a computer monitorim a photography novice who chose this camera because i wanted  a point and shoot that would make good shutter speed and fstop decisions for me
 a single high quality lens that telescopes and does wide angle so i wouldnt have buy or change lenses
 excellent picture quality in prints and on screen
 an easy to use camera
i was quickly up to speed on most features after  read of the manual and a few experimental pictures
 easy transfer of pictures to the computer
easy to use photo software that comes with the camerathe product excels in all these qualities except   also im glad the batterys rechargeable and that the lens cap is attached to the cameraim deducting the th star for  reasons  i followed all the instructions in the manual for downloading my pictures and it didnt work
i had to call customer service and be walked through an entirely different procedure not in the instructions
also they recommended that i save pictures on my desktop so i wont lose them
she told me other people have had the same downloading difficulty but i dont know how widespread it is or if its been corrected
i had to buy a couple extras to be completely satisfied with this camera   extra battery because the one that comes with the camera only lasts about an hour
  mb memory stick because the  mb memory that comes with the camera runs out very quicklybottom line  now that ive troubleshot the downloading problem and bought the extras im very happy with this camerai like the camera very much
what is especially nice about it is the size
yes it is rather large but that is a plus when you are a large handed person and this is one of the most comfortable cameras that i have tried out to handle
the buttons arent microscopic and the lens makes a pleasant handhold also
smaller is not always betterthe one thing i do not care for is the response time when taking a picture and also when viewing pictures that have been taken
the camera also tends to get a little testy when you try to do close upsotherwise lovelythe heart of any camera is in the lens and the zeiss lens on the sony dscfv is one of the best if not the best lens ive seen on a fixedlens digital camera
add to that the high resolution and sonys novel pixel interpolation software and youve got a camera that will produce absolutely striking xs prints so good that youll find it hard to believe they werent made from film
add to that the manula override and incredible cool looks of this camera and youve got a winning package almostunfortunately sony decided to equip this otherwise outstanding camera with their own proprietary memory stick storage format
these sticks cost anywhere from  more than smartcards and are only available from sony
and with the resolution this camera produces youll need at least one  meg memory stick more if you plan on extended outings
the ergonomics arent great either
this is not an easy camera to use with two hands and work the controls as well
it almost looks as if ergonomics were sacrificed for stylehence only  stars
if sony had used a more standard highdensity storage format nd made it a little easier to handle theyd have a star productmy dad had an old sony camera that i use sometimes and the memory capabilities leave something to be desired but oh well it was my dadsso i bought an extra memory card to have and it works great we had lotz of odd sized photos mainly from picture people
it was really hard to find photo book for thosepioneer jumbo magnetic page xpando album is a great way to store and save the photos
it makes photos look good toogood filter does the job
using this on my canon mm lens no problems
     this thing eventually fell apart and after pretty minimal usefilters should simply not fall apart or should have a lifetime warranty will never buy from this company againupdate called customer support and they are either going to fix or send me a new one at no additional charge
spoke directly to a customer service rep he took the initiative for this course of actiongreat customer service back on the tiffen traini use this on my mm kit lens and it works well with no issues
tiffen is known for making decent quality filtersthis is a good reasonably priced filter for any camera
the polarizer filter works well and is a good addition for special occasions requiring a polarizing filterits must for anyone serious about outdoor and landscape photography
its a great product
one criticism i have is about the container which can be smaller therefore not taking up too much space in your bag
i replaced the container with an old much more compact onethe construction of this filter is very acceptable not bw league but close
the performance is also great with no color cast perceptible
i highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable polarizerits a real good polarizer
tiffen  mm circular polarizer fits well on my tamron  mm macro
it cuts the reflection very well and this is useful during macro photography
i would have loved to attach a multicoated polarizer but this does its job quite wellthe cpl is a basic filter  that should be in your kit it intensifies skies and reduce reflections on nonmetallic surfaces
tiffen has a good reputation making filtersusing my nikkor mm lens on a d i get great picture quality but i fully expect the filter to fall off at some point
as the fit isnt very snug
that being said its a  filter and the nikon one is  so i cant expect that muchit does a good job
it is a bit difficult to put on and take off
there is no reference mark so user can cell the position it is is
this works a bit different than the old traditional polarizer lense that was rotated to create polarizer effect and was more visable through the view finder
no instructions came with the filter
i assumed i knew how to use one but these for digital are different
i am sure it will be great when i get acclimated to using itbought to go with a  to mm nikon lens
 works well i took it on safari and it was a definite boon when used on photos of hippo in the water
 no one else on the trip had anything close to the shots i did they just got a lot of reflection off the water this cut it outim not all that experienced with polarizers but this one works well and is easy to handle it turns easily and smoothly and stays in place
the only downside is that it is prone to lens flare which isnt much a problem because for the polarizer to be useful you kinda need to be shooting at roughly deg to the sun
i do get the sense that a better polarizer would have a stronger effect but im actually very happy with the pictures i get with this so im not complainingoverall great for the price
im sure there are better filters but im happy with this onedoes a fine job doubles as neutral density filter
i wish it came in the older style container which was round and small
now comes in a large rectangular box that wastes a lot of room in my backpacki dont use filters much at all but this circular polarizer works fairly well in removing unwanted reflections
you get what you pay for
this is not a bad filter but hardly the best one out therei have owned a few tiffen polarizers in the past and they never disappoint
the price is reasonable and the quality is up to standardsthis is not great but it is what you expect from cheap tiffen
i like it though and dont use a filter enough to consider buying again a more expensive much better hoya pro filter
and its soooo much cheaperseemed to be good quality and do the job
i am not an expert so i bought one in a mid price range and was pleased until my sigma  mm lens died after only  months so warranty gone lens never seemed right from the start but completely dying in  months is the pits
so i can recommend the filter but not the lensjust as described perfect fit and good quality i would redone this product to anyone as it is working out perfectlyi love it great for the price
if you have the money to upgrade to one of the better go for it 
however i was ust trying to find something to protect the glass of my lensa must for sunny days and good value for the price you could pay a lot more and thats ok if you camera is earning you cash
budding photographers shouldnt be without at least this filter in their arsenal of photography gadgets and gismosive only used this once but liked it
im upgrading soon and didnt want to invest in a pricey mm filter knowing id have to repurchase when i get to upgrade standard shipping was fine it only took a few days
packaging was greati have only used this for  days at the beach
i did a great job of cutting reflections and glare in the bright sunlight
also did a great job of deepening the blue skyi have issues with the budget tiffen uvfilter not being multicoated due to the potential for flare
while this is not multicoated you are less likely to experience flare due to the types of scenes that you typically shoot with polarizers not into the sun
it does do a decent job of polarizing and while i would prefer a multicoated one they are significantly more expensive unlike multicoated uv filters
this does the job and i am able to manage the flare so ill stick with this until i can afford a better oneits not as good as bw or hoya but it gets the job done wellthis polarizer is useful to reduce excessive glare on my outdoor shots
the polarizer can be rotated to control the amount of polarizing effect that your camera getsoverall this is a good buy for almost any kind of dslr camera to enhance outdoor photos and giving that deeper blue sky and more vivid tone of outdoor shotsi own a panasonic video camera and needed some glare reduction on it and so this seemed like the perfect choice between price and function
the filter does spin as it needs to be set but this is a bit unsmooth for my liking
other than that it works wellbeing budget minded i didnt want to spend  for a cl polarizer since im not a high end user but i didnt want to buy a  cheepo either
this seemed some where in the middle with good reviewsthe tiffen polarizer really brings out the definition in the clouds and removes glare on water or shiny surfaces just as it should
super snug fit smooth rotation good photo resultsdefinitely get the plastic wrenches for removal though
once its on your lens its on
tightening ring is so narrow fingers just wont dooverall though very happy with this filterits a circular polarizer a pretty good one too
this particular one takes about  to  stops out of your exposure
i use it for the nd effect sometimes
no problems with it on my nikon  or purchased for a new d with mm lenses
works well and does what it is supposed to do
screws on easily and removes easily
produced  nice results
would recommend and purchase againi selected this product to give me more vivid colors and reduce glare
i did not realize the polarizer would reduce my light levels so drastically
otherwise i am pleased with the quality and the shippingname brand and quality build
i use it on a canon l series lens without degrading the image
i would recommend it to a friendi was told to get this by a professional picture taker
i was taking pictures of snow covered hills and the sun was ruining my shots
this is very light and thin about  inch thick
the filter is two parts each about  inch thick and bonded together with the ability to rotate the front part
make sure to screw the filter snug into your lens then you can spin the front  inch thick part
it is a polarizer and must be rotated as you view your subject through the camera
as you turn the filter clockwise you will see the glare disappear and if you keep going you will mess up your shot
this is a quick learning device and fun to play withi remove it for indoor shots and moon shotsi have used polarizers before and use them with any camera that will accept them
this was an inexpensive filter but it works well it has occasionally unscrewed from the lens while rotating the filter but that could be fixed by a dab of silicone of other product on the mounting threadsi am using this filter on my everyday carry lens
i previously had a hoya pro multicoat filter on this lens but it broke
i wasnt excited about spending  on another mm cpl so i gave the tiffen a shot
while i dont have a quantitative set of comparisons between the two my impression is the tiffen is not capable producing the same results as the hoya
but the results are good enough
im taking candids of my family high school sports and vacation snapshots not producing high art since they effect of a polarizer is difficult to duplicate in photoshop
this one performs well at a good price so picked up a cooupleof different sizes for my lens collection in my new micro four thirds mirrorless systemgood quality especially for the price
however as a newby photographer i learned something circular polarizers dont really work very well on ultra wide angle lenss too much variation in color change across the viewing angle expanse
better to use polarizing filter plateswanted to take some landscape photos and needed a polarizing filter
my lens is a  vr fx so the filter had both to be accessible and not alter the cameras ability to focusthis filter does an excellent job if used properly in landscape however i would recommend removing the filter once you have finished as you can get some unexpected results if you use it indoors or with flashi ordered this particular model of polarizing filter for my canon ti
it works but i just can not see much polarizing when i look through the viewfinder and turn the filter ring
however the pictures are fine
it seems as if an older model of polarizing filter that i had would enable me to visualize easily the changing brightness
this filter does seem to be doing a decent jobstandard nikon  mm fits most older and smaller lenses 
rotates for best effect for the lighting 
the quality seems good in the image  taken with it 
i would recommend it in my experience tiffen makes a very good filter and this one is no exception
threads match nicely and the filter seats firmly yet is easily removed
the rotation of the filter is buttery smooth and stays put
the tiffen adds a nice degree of polarization that gives colors a bit more saturation and contrast with a minor loss of overall transmission
if youre not shooting with a polarizing filter you probably dont realize just how much strayreflected light is affecting your photos
once you see the difference a good filter like this can make youll wonder why you didnt start using one sooner
put your uv filter back in the bag and put something in front of your lens that will actually improve every shot
ive spent bigger money on other brands of filter hoya bw et al and i just dont see that money buying me a better filter
maybe im missing something but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and tiffen filters do the job for me without breaking my budgetthis lens works well and seems to be very good quality
just a note that i neglected to pay attention to whether it was multicoated or not
my next filter will be
it is especially significant on the uv protection filter that i got along with the circular polarizer as i seem to get much more in the way of reflection  sun flares than i think i should be gettingthis is a decent filter it will make your skies bluer and your clouds a bit more contrasty
the effect could be more pronounced though i cant get the skies quite as deep blue as i would like even at  degrees to the sun
the filter also does a decent job at removing reflections but i feel this could be better alsoso in short this is a decent filter for the money spent but could use some slight improvementsmaybe if i was a professional photographer i would buy a different product but this is good for me at a very reasonable pricetiffen and hoya both make decent midpriced filters
for the basics you cant go wrong with these
ive owned many tiffen filters over the years never had a problemi bought this recently for my nikon d and it fits perfectly
it is very easy to screw on and off havent encountered having to use pliers to take it off like some reviewersthis is my first cpl filter i have owned so i cannot compare it to more expensive filters
however it is clear that a nicer cpl filter would exist in the world
i took some difficult photos of snowy mountains idaho sawtooths yesterday and had a tough time aligning the dark polarizer onto the blue sky behind the mountains see photo
however when taking pictures of riverscreeks the polarizer cuts through the whitewater and allows you to see the river rocks see my beforeafter photos
also the green foliage beside the river pops with the filter
unfortunately at time the polarizer gives the photos an artificial look as opposed to a more natural look
like its been touched upit is a great filter i love it
but definitely amateur quality perfect for my needs if you want to take professionalquality photos then you will need something nicernice filter great for sky and water shots
i liked the results using it to shoot in a forested area that had a lot of different lightingive had this on my nikon mm for a few weeks now and really like it
it truly brings out great colors in the photos
however its much darker than i would like for a polarizer
this combined with the aperature of the  has resulted in some blurry photos for me especially indoors when ambient light is crucial
that is mostly my fault for being too lazy to take it off pero ni modowell constructed
has a quality feel
made in usait polarizes the light coming through your lenstwist the twopiece filter ring to see the variationits not easy to operate with a lens hood on
i reach into the hood to twist the filter ring but that blocks part of the viewfinder while im doing it
not a huge problemliked this one so well i ordered another for my other lens much better than the afga photo polarizer  that i also bought from amazon as it had issuesmy father got me started with tiffen filters many years ago and ive never had any reason to change
this is exactly what i expected and performs perfectly
unless you are a serious pro and know that you have specific needs that require something else id recommend this to anyoneon my canon ti kit  lens this polarizer works well
make for awesome sky pictures with deep rich colors
if you are looking for a cheaper polarizer this is a good one to geti took off a star because of how it works in screwing it on and off
if you dont pay attention you can keep twisting the top piece of the polarizer and never actually screw it on or off
its a two piece assembly that can twist on top but not turn the threads
its not really a flaw but is frustrating until you figure out how its on there and with big fingers it can be hard to get just rightid still buy it again though i dont really ever take it off my telephoto lensawesome resultsthe price is right and this is as good as any of the more expensive ones i have used on my primary camera and the backup camerasbut not a superb filter  however you will know that by the price
i bought it for an inexpensive lens so only wanted a sufficient productjust received  tested asap photos taken with and without cpl filter
for my camera canon powershot sxhs i strongly recommend the  stepup adapter the bayonet style not the threaded one i purchased and tested both its easy and faster to installremove
once fixed the cpl on the  stepup adapter ill leave them together always
this will prevent thread cuts and misalignmentscpl usage  it makes the difference even i was expecting a little bit more cutting of the reflexions but for the money spent its very good
tested at  degres as all indicate vs sunlight direction and the stones are visible in the pond due to reflexions cut at water surface
as you increase the angle the more effective it is its doing the job
at the beginning you need a little experience till you find the max open and max closed positions cpl ring rotation then you play with the ring for effects
im looking forward to enjoy this cpl filter furthermore for better picturesnice filter for the price i would buy againsimple and cheap
improves my daylight landscapes remarkably well
dual purpose protects my lens also
another necessity for any serious photographermy brother is a guide for fishing and he asked me to purchase for my camera so he can take me out and capture video and photos of fish in the water
i have not had a chance to use this yet but hope i will soonworks as advertised
filters out reflections from water and haze from our south carolina sun
pictures are sharper with no fuzzynessnot much to say other than youve got to have one  buy a decent one for the extra  bucks and enjoy the this multiuse filterthis filter is okay
it didnt really wow me by any means but it did work although it can produce flares sometimes
the nikon filter costs a lot more money than this so im still happy with it
and for anyone wondering this fit perfectly on my mm kit lens that came with my dfast shipping
the difference compared to regular pictures wasnt as great as i wished but it certainly reduced a lot of extra glare
its worth itthis filter fit easily on my camera and adjusts very easily also
i like its small size and the compactness of its storage casea friend told me to get a circular polarizing filter for my canon lens so the sky here which is always blue would pop if there were any clouds
i needed a protective filter anyway so thought id try it
i really cannot tell the difference when i move the lens as to the difference in polarization
but it is a protector for my nice canon lens even though it is a bit too expensive than just a plain polarizer lensfor just that purposei used this on my canon rebel ti and it was very good  for the pictures i took at sandy beach on a sunny cloudless daysome of the people at the local camera shop dont have a high opinion of tiffen
however i have used this lens for hundreds of photographs along with my expensive bh and see no difference
unless youre a professional or plan on making large posters i bet you wont see any difference eitheri must say this is not a bad filter for the money
id buy more for other cameras and lensesworks as addvertised does a pretty decent job might cut down just a bit on sharpness but the lenses we have today are so sharp to begin with compared to lenses years ago that it doesnt really matter much plus using todays superior processign softwares allows us to get back any lost sharpness quitre nicelyi got this filter but not use much anyways still like it it will help you some timewhen you want to shoot in slow speedbought this for my canon  seems to be of good quality and it was reasonably priced
arrived quickly and in good conditioncircular polarizerif you have ever owned a pair of polarized sunglasses then you now what this filter can do for your camera
by reducing reflections and stray light waves this filter makes any scene that much cleareryou will see more vibrant colors in bright scenes your skies will turn a deeper blue and clouds pop right off the picture
reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as metal or watera polarizer works on a specified plain meaning that the lens must be perpendicular to the direction of the main light source
as with sunglasses they are parrallel to the ground which works in most cases since the sun is normally above youthe key to using this filter is that it swivels
looking through the view finder turn the filter until the picture is clear and vibrant
youll notice the image changing as you turn it
in this manner you may even adjust the level of polarizationa great deal for a very valuable accessory
this filter works perfect and compared to the higher priced filters is a stealuv filterthe uv filter prevents haze and reduces bluish tint in photographs by reducing stray uv rays entering the lens
it also has the added benefit of protecting the lens and glass from scratches and accidental damagethere have been stories of photographers dropping their lens and the filter acts as a sort of impact absorber shattering but leaving the lens unharmed
i would much prefer replacing the inexpensive filter rather than a lensin my experience with the tiffen uv filter i have noticed an increased amount of lens flare and reflections over my slightly more expensive uv filters
if i were you id put out the small amount of extra money for a better filter preferably multicoated to reduce glareenjoyi bought this because my husband said we needed one
i just cant figure out when i need to use it
i like tiffen lens so i know i will like this one i just have to get use to itthis filter worked well for me
i searched for a good polarizing filter to used when shooting koi ponds and a lot of them cost hundreds of dallors
i ordered this one and it worked greatwas a bit hard to get threaded when i first got it but stays in place nicely and accomplishes what i bought it fori use it in conjunction with the canon fadcc mm filter adapter for my canon gx
it works just as advertised
great for using when shooting water scenes or around shiny nonmetallic objectstiffen makes some of the very best filters
these work perfectly with any canon
i bought these along with the uv filtersto be fair the falling off may be the lens  i cant tell
basically it seems like there just arent enough threads engaging
i am using it on a refurbished by nikon nikon afs   i have not tried any other filter on the lensi  have the same filter in mm and have used it on  other lenses  and  and it seems to engage more than this bigger filter in the longer lensas long as you get it seated and remember to twist the filter orientation in the direction of tightening the filter its okay
i got it backwards and ended up unscrewing the filter which only seems to be less than a full revolution  less that one full thread and it fell into dry sand
it doesnt look like it got damaged but i just dont enjoy using it because of the high possibility it may fall off againand its hard to get the threads startedagain i havent used any other filter on this lens so it could be the lens too which is more of a question because the lens was refurbished although the threads dont look bad or as though theyd been truncated somehowas for the pictures i used it to effectively remove glare from a water body
it seems to work fine as does my mm which ive used a lot more
no complaints but i may not see differences between this and a bw anyway
i can certainly see the difference between this and no filter
id buy one again
i think the tiffens are a great cross between results and price
when i start seeing artifacts maybe ill spring for a bw or other brandi have already taken several pictures with it
it does appear to enhance the blueness of the sky however i do not see a difference when rotating it
will try it against the glare of waterive only used this a few times since i bought it so my review will be limited
im still finding it difficult to get consistent results with this filter but from what ive read its not unusual
with continued use i expect that at some point it will be nd naturegood to have especially in sunny shots
seems to make all photos more clear
good feature to have when taking outdoor photos and under flourescent lightthis was a good purchase
did not realize what i was missing in my outdoor photographs until i started putting this filter on and taking pictures
definitely makes a difference in every shot
just remember to put the tiffen logo towards the sun as you spin itit does need to be in the right spot to work properly
but can easily be adjusted for more light as needed tooit fits and works as a polarizer should
this company has been making filters for a long long long timei was looking for a filter that would provide me with a good performance at a good price and this one definitely nails itgood quality filter metal and glass construction
so many of the lower cost filters these days have plastic mounts but this one feels like brass
threads on and off easily without being too loose
seems to be pretty tough although i havent droptested it yet
since its not a warming polarizer it cools colors slightly but on most days i like thatbought this one to fit my larger lens
its amazing how many people dont understand that the polarization is only effective when shooting with the sun to either sideive never used a topoftheline circular polarizer but im happy enough with the results from this one that i dont think i will ever upgrade much above this one
its stayed free of scratches and cleans easily in the fieldused with various canon ef lseries lenses you can see sample images at pxcomseannmhoganim using this currently on my canon mm f lens for day time shots and to reduce unnecessary glare aside from better saturated colors if not add some warmthconstruction is great solid no distortion looking at the filter and the mm fits perfectly on my f lens
like any filter youll find the lens cap wont be a solid fit as the thread on the opposite end isnt as tall
but the cap will stay there but just be sure to watch for any bumps that may cause it to come offthe range which it cuts the glare on glass windows water and any reflective surface is great
the sky can look washed out all the way to saturated darker blue color with clouds popping out while depending on the orientation you can add a cool or warmer feel to the photosive used heliopan and bw so compared to the prograde filter youll probably find that this polarizer isnt the best out there but for the price it does what its supposed to
when i had bw mm multicoated cpl  here on my canon mm lens the sky really popped with dark saturated blue skies and the control was betteroverall its a great polarizer
unless you absolutely need more saturated colors and reduce glare to the maxium then go with the more expensive multicoated filters
i would say this tiffen filter is a standard for circular polarizer and wont disappoint
plus it protects your lens like any uv or other filters used
id rather smash a  filter versus a  lenscircular polarizer does make daytime shots more fun and less correction post processing
and sometimes you cant control everything you shoot with so a filter becomes a must in some cases
with a lens that can be as wide as ff sometimes putting the iso level  doesnt always allow you to shoot at the widest aperture
in a sense it does act like a neutral density filter to a degree while cutting glare and allowing you to shoot a fast moving subject or freeze the momentit is hard to believe the srp as this is not a super thin filter which allows multiple filters without getting into the field of view but it is an excellent coated polarizing filter with smooth circular actionbought three of these
works great but two of them is kind of loose when trying to turn
may be it is meworks very well just recently go this and a hoya for a different lens
both work very well on their respective lenses and ive quite happy with bothworks as i expected
it was quite difficult to get on my canon ef mm lens the first time
i thought it wasnt going to fit but then finally it lined up
once it was on it worked greati am not a pro but i like the effect of being able to see deeper into water and capture rays of sunlight
brings colors to life and protects my lense and camera sensor from damaging uv lightuse when you need to cut down on too many reflective surfaces messing up your shot
works as intended wellitem arrived as expectedpro it does take glare out of pictures it makes the green and blue really stand out in your photoscon it is difficult to rotate with hood in place also difficult to find the correct area for the optimum picture
these are not problems of the polarizer filter but of me the operatori would not recommend using this filter insidehelps reduce the solar glare off water shooting directly into the sun and allows me to take water fall shots without have me to  use a longer shutter to create that smooth stream water fall effect when not using a tripodthough i not see a huge difference when turning the circular polarizer but it does work well and is made from glass and not plasticthis polarizer helps when im looking to enhance the colors and mood of my picture without overpowering it
makes things pop a bit more blues and greens especially
doesnt seem to work on my canon  lens but perfect for the mmi recently purchased this cpl for a trip to orlando
mm is an awfully big filter size and when you get into this range prices just really seem to climb
i know some people dont have trouble dropping  dollars on a filter but when i really dont use it that often this filter seemed much more what i was looking forbasically it is a simple uncoated polarizing filter
construction is decent
i found the filter had a tendency to stick a little but never had any trouble getting it offas others have said it isnt super strong but does make your skies bluer in a nice not over bearing way
i did shoot into the sun occasionally with the filter on and found that it did increase flare slightly but not too badly
certainly it doesnt soak up enough light to be used as a neutral density filterall in all i am pleased with this purchase
if i were a professional photographer i probably would opt for one of the multi coated options but as it is i found it very good for the price and more than adequate for my needsyou can check the polarization extinction by holding the outside nonthreaded side to your lcd monitor and rotating it
it is almost entirely dark at  deg angle when i try this
i have a polarized laser pointer that i used to determine the polarization angle of this filter
it makes my lcd monitor dark when the polarization of the filter is oriented along     being upright  this means my lcd monitor is polarized along the    line
dont know if all lcd monitors have the same polarizationquality looks good
it is easy to rotate after i have it screwed on to my camera lens
i scratched a line along the edge to mark the polarization
i gave it  stars because i bought another cpl goja that is just as good for   the pricetiffin doesnt claim that this is a multi coated filter and at this price point you shouldnt expect it to be but just to dispel and lingering thoughtsit isntit is however a good budget level filter
it has more glare and light loss when compared with a coated filter but it works just fine for most applicationsnecessary for intensifying morning and evening light when shooting landscapes or warming portraits
it is one of the trinity filters cpl nd and warming filtersit warms up the color but i wouldnt use it solely for everything
i wouldnt recommend to use it in portrait
the filter pinklike color
so it pop ups anything in range of this spectra means the red tone will be added to your face
a combination of  filter with uv sigma filter reduces this effect and actually makes skin color look more natural id compare that combination with cokin c filter
the tiffen  transparency is about half stop what adds a bit contrast to your pictures
the filter mm well made and did not give a vignetting at mm focal length with sigma mm lens even with uv sigma filter on
the filter has internal thread which allows to put on another mm filterall in all the  warming filter enhances pictures it did make my pictures soft the price is right in my opinion  worth to buyas a  filter this works well
i bought this to see if i liked neutral density filters enough before i spent over  on a  stop filterfor myself it does not work well at all
a  filter is a three stop filter which means onehalf of onehalf of onehalf of the light gets through or   which is the same as  because 
what does this mean
take a picture and look at the shutter speed
if youre in daylight condition lets say th of a second
if only  of the light gets through youre going to need to take  times longer to take the same photo or  of a second
those nice smooth lines in the water are going to take a lot than  of a second to capture
you can try and force your camera to take longer to take a photo drop the iso increase the fstop of the aperture but this  strength isnt going to work in daytime at all
perhaps it could work in sunsets or you could stack two or three of them but you run the risk of imperfections becoming more visiblei use this stacked with my variable nd filter when i need it a bit darker in a range where my variable tends to get a bit noisy and iq becomes a concern
this covers that range nicely getting my image dark enough for day light long exposures
this does not get dark enough to use for daytime long exposure photography by itself if thats what your using it foryou cant fault this filters quality for the price
i use bw filters for uv and polarizer duties and they cost many times more
their glass and construction seems superior but it should for their history and price
for my photographic purposes i wont use this filter as much
nice filter thats made in the usai am a professional film maker and have a kit of canon l primes that i have used on everything from dslrs to red epics
nd filters such as these are indispensable
however some nd filters will give a red color cast due to the disproportionate ir spectrum they are not filtering out
these inexpensive tiffens seem to filter the spectrum well
better than some of the higher end filters i have in my kitif you think this is the strongest nd filter you can get then it is wrong
do not buy this
this is only stop and there are  or  stop filters available
learn about nd filters before settling on onewith this nd filter you cannot take pictures of water falls in bright day light even with smallest aperture f
but if you want to take the same later in the day around sunset this will help you a lot
i took lots of pictures using this filter during my trip to yosemite
i could take really nice waterfall motion with  sec exposure during sunset but all the pictures i took during day time were washed outthey all became too brightif you have a polarizing filter you may stack on top of it be careful with vignetting to get more darknessthe filter itself is very well built and i was able to easily screwunscrew from the lens
i would put some more money to get more fstop
i will post some sample pics i took sooncuts the light like i want it to
i use this on my l and its great for those sunny california days
i dont use it a ton but thats why i went with tiffen as opposed to something more expensive like bwused with acanon efs mm f is usm lens for canon dslr cameras and works pretty well
best conditions would likely be early morning or early evening as afternoon sunshine even with clouds is too much light for this filter to lessengreat filter while youre waiting for the big stopper
wont break the bank
easy to use easy to screw oni wish it was multicoated to make it less susceptible to lens flare
other than that it is a good filterthe filter itself is very well built the perfect amount of power its terrificeasy to screw on and off
allowing you to take some beautiful shots if you combine a cpl filter effects will be goodit works fine at mm with the canon mm kit lenstiffen makes good filters
what can i say
it works ad advertised
used one on my slr and wondered how they would work on my new dslr
they work the same and allow for more ceativity ni your shotsive put this filter on many canon lenses and its worked just fine with no perceivable loss in image quality except on one lensfor about a week i used this off and on a l is
near the end of the week i noticed a faint scratchabrasion in the dead center of the filter as well as on the front element of the lens
thus i stopped using it on the trip
when i returned to civilization and the land of the internet i did some searching and found quite a few other folks on dpreviewdotcom complaining about the same issue with the tiffen filter and their l lensall in all id recommend this filter but try it on all the lenses you intend to use to make sure theres some clearance between the filter and the front elementthis nd filter work well outside on a bright sunny day so that you dont get over exposure and can finally get balance exposurebut i havent used it as much as id immagined i would  much less since i got a dslri ordered three nd filters at the same time
two arrived in perfect condition this one was clearly used
it had been very badly cleaned and was rattling around in the hard plastic package
i have no idea how well it works because i sent it back to amazon immediately
when i get a replacement i will post a review on the product rather than the condition of the product
i have been ordering from amazon for years and this is the first time i have ever received anything that was in anything but pristine condition
considering this was the most important of the three filters i bought i am very disappointedamazon sent me a new filter and an rmabasic nd filter
i have stacked it with other nd filters to get even the brightest day dark enough for long exposuresnot much else to say other than the customer service is why i buy from amazona good filter for reducing the available light down by  stops because the light is too bright or as in many nd situations a long exposure is desired with a slow shutter speed to enhance certain aspects of the photograph being taken such as waterscapesif you want to make water look silky or bring out the more color and beautiful contrast on your day photos its a must have
i like the fact that you can screw another filter on top to stop it down even moreever seen those photos of rivers and waterfalls where the water is all blurred and misty
this filter can help you achieve that and other effects
it drastically cuts down the light passing through your lens forcing slower shutter speeds that will give the blur effectthis is the strongest nd filter you may want to look at the  or  for a less noticable effect
also be prepared to use a tripod
this filter will easily push your shutter speed into multiple seconds so youd have to have onethe neutral density filter is really nice it is not as dark as i expected but there are more darker filters depends on what you want to do with itive enjoyed using this tiffen filter  its a basic filter and does what its supposed to do without problems or hasslesprice was right
i shy away from cheaper filters but have had good luck with tiffen especially for filters ill use occasionally
this one is great for reducing light so a slower shutter does not blow out your photothis is a good nd filter
this is not full  stop filter but does the job
came in oem box but the filter had few finger prints on it  had to clean that up before the use
fits well light yet strong not solid but strong  does the job took few good shots from ityes this is a lovely produce for the price
good solid piece of glass and ring
but one that disappointed me to give  star less
quality control for this product is awful
when i took it off from the box it had lot of dust and smudges
seeing that i couldnt believe this is made in usa
that was rather disappointing though after using a micro fiber cloth it was good
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent pocket friendly nd filter
i use it for my mm kit lens of nikon d to get good smooth water surface
but note this is not ideal for getting slow shutter to capture smooth water fallflow since its only nd  but ideal to shoot good depth of field during bright light
please tiffen improve your quality controlat this price point you get what you pay for and this filter does its job
if you have spent good money on your glass though go ahead and spend good money on a filter and get a higher quality oneits cheap but it works
knocks exposure down  stops like promised
the only complaint i have about the filter is that the threads seem a little off  ive managed to drop it in the snow a few times because i thought it was seated in the thread on my lens and it wasntthe filter arrived in decent shape just a little dust and with a quick clean it was ready to go
if you dont want to spend much on an nd filter this is the one for you
dont expect perfect optical quality but its very functionalthis was what i ordered but i guess that it wasnt really what i was looking for
it really doesnt make all that much of a difference
it will let you increase the exposure by a little bit but it wont be a huge difference
i was hoping to make rough surf look like fog with like a  second exposure but even on an overcast day iso  f and this filter i could only go a second or twoconsider buying a more powerful filter especially if you want to take long exposures on sunny daysoh and its really hard to look through the viewfinder with one of these on
youre almost blind when youre using one of these so there will be a lot of guessand checki would really recommend some strong stackable square filters instead
theyre a lot more useful
look into it
thats what im going to buy nextim an amateur photographer and thought this was great for the price
had a tiny scratch near the edge
was just small enough for me to not want to deal with returning it
my dad who is much more experienced than i am tells me that its a decent filter though he notes that there are much better ones on the market albeit for a higher priceit is a three stop filter it works
it is for very bright days and using higher shutter speeds while leaving the iso at a low level
it does not change the color of your pictures wit just darkens them
if you want to get that sunglasses look you need a cpli bought this for video work
i find that a lot of the issues some other people point out for this is easily adjustable on poststarting a photography hobby
get this
experience how to use these tools dont get caught up with iq and exercise your technical ability compositionbuy expensive alternatives that will save you postprocessing time when you start making  on this hobbyusing this linear polarizer together with a circular polarizer same brand to create a ev variable neutral density filter
the camera can focus through them if the circular is mounted first
works fine and the threads are of good fit and qualityseems good
does what it is supposed to
and did not fall apart like a hoya i had boughttiffen offers better than average quality at a decent price
this is no exception
this same filter would have cost me twice as much if i bought it at a local storethe research i conducted before my purchase showed that tiffen was a brand one can rely on
a trusted name in its fieldit is a basic filter that works pretty well with my dslr
different than film however
good qualitythis filter is primarily for bw photography although you could use it for color with a rather obvious and unusual effectthe lens works by filtering some of the blue from your photo
this means that for cloudy sky and some vegetation and architecture shots you will see greater contrast
there are more or less intense red filters available depending on the degree of effect you wantdo not see any problems with the image when i took the pictures with the camera and no distortions on the picturefor under  not counting shipping this is a good protector for the lens
have taken pictures with and without the lens and cant see any difference in the pictures even during the daylight where its supposed to mitigatae the bluish tinge
so if it does nothing else but protect the lens from harm its worth it just for thatlong ago learned that a a is farcheaper than a scratched lens so i have a on all lensesso my lenses last a long timethe effect on my pictures is negligible  hardly a difference if any
bought it to protect the lens though  and it does do that
ive found it impossible to completely clean up this baby  which was relatively speaking very dirty when i got it
in fact i thought it was all scratched up but most of the stuff came off  with a lot of effort and time
at the same time i bought a dollarsomething generic filter to have as a back up  it fully cleaned up in no time
seems crisper to the naked eye
but spooked by the price im leaving that as the back up
though it does look better
its a japan made uv filter
this one is a us made sky  for what its worthive purchased many filters made by tiffen and ive only had an issue with one of my cp filters which did have too many ghosts
out of all their filters i enjoy the sky a the most
i use them mainly for portraiture or candids and mainly outdoor
indoors i usually switch to a uv simply for protection
for the price you cant beat these filters
for  or  more sure you can probably find heavier duty glass
i also own some higher end filters but that isnt always necessaryperfect fit on my fuji xs
the jury is still out on the quality of the glass though
im using it as an adapter for the ezfoto mm black filter adapter ring and metal lens hood
they play well togetheri discovered the joys of photoshop and so these colored filters have been relegated to the shame of obsolescencei have had no issues with the tiffen filters not being glass howeverwell built filter that arrived on time
i recently used it shooting a nice sunset at point lobos state park ca
definitely helped with foreground exposure
i would recommend iti purchased this for use on my sony nex camera and it worked like a charm
i shoot primarily in raw which means that i can typically pull a lot of detail out of the shadows and end up with an image with an hdr look without multiple exposures
even though shooting in raw increases your ability to take advantage of your cameras dynamic range your scene may still exceed it during sunrises and sunsets or really any shot where there is a large dynamic rangewhile software like lightroom can help balance out your image by opening up shadows and bringing down the highlights it cant balance out whats not there
what might not be there are your highlights if you are not using this filter
if you are unfamiliar with the term blown out highlights its when the high end of the exposure is out of the dynamic range and you have no information at all it will basically remain a white area regardless of how much you try to adjust it
this filter will help pull down the exposure of the brighter areas so you can at least get all the information
if its not too drastic then your image may be ready to go out of the box
if not at least youll have something to work with when it comes time to work on it in post
worth the price if you want a better chance of capturing those dramatic scenesthe only disadvantage is that the graduation is fixed so you lose some flexibility but its much more convenient and cost effective to carry this as opposed to a set of plates and a mounting set like thecokin h pseries nd grad kit
that being said if you need multiple sizes or want to consider stacking nd  graduated nd then you might want to consider the plate system
i have heard good things about theformatthitech   stopsfilterthe tiffen filter is quality made
and is really nice for doing beach shots where the sky or the water sometimes gets overexposed or blown out when trying to get the perfect mix of sky and water detailhighly recommended please note this is the same review that i gave for the mm filter of the same typethese filters are very useful when there is a large difference between light and dark in a scene and the fact that it is graduated means that the effect is less noticeable at the transition because the dark fades to lightthe hard stop filters dont fade and the hard edge can often be seen in the image
the outer ring of the filter rotates and allows the photographer to adjust which part of the image gets the dark side of the filtertiffen is a good quality company and this is a good product
that being said if you have the money you might want to consider this same filter made by bw or heliopanlove my graduated nd filter
great for landscape photograpy
softens the clouds and sky so they are not blown out
real glass so its durable
my only complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to tell when the filter is level with the horizon so i took a silver marker and marked the rotating filter so that im confident im not going to have a crooked filter effect
i use it all the time with my nikon mm with a mm step up ring
i highly recommend iti havent had the opportunity to use this item yet
tiffen makes good filters for photographers
it can only be used in landscape photography where you want to see richer colors and dramatic lighting in the sky
ill give it a shot one of these dayspretty decent nd filter for the price
not much i can say about it its a  cnd by another name and a staple item for just about any photographers bag
overall it feels sturdy and well made and it fits my nikon mm zoom just like should
i noticed pretty quickly it also adds neutral density so yeah how sweet is that
unfortunately this neutral density filter does not improve my cars mpg nor does it whiten my teeth
really tiffen is that asking so muchi havent had the opportunity to use it yet cut it is well made and the price was right
very nicethis is not great but it is what you expect from cheap tiffen
i like it though and dont use a filter enough to consider buying again a more expensive much better hoya pro filterthis is a great filter for the price easy to put on or remove from your lens
great for keeping glare out of your lens and camera
used it on my trip to the grand canyon and it remove most if not all the haze that was over the canyon from my picturesgood build good enough optics does what its made to do
oh yeah and since its tiffen it is cheapi was really amazed by the price at first and i had high expectations when i bought it
but when i actually tested it on my camcorder it did not actually make a whole lot of difference compared to a shot without the filter
and it was a bright sunny day
i thought it would bring the colors to a better contrast or betterlooking but all it did on the camcorder was to allow it to have a higher exposure  which can result in a deeper depthoffield  which makes your movie more focuscentered and look more like a film
my point is what i got was not what i expectedin conclusion i would say only buy it if you know what to use it for
to me this is professional level stuff so dont even bother if you are just looking for better looking videos for your  camcorder
there are other tiffen filters that will do thatget reflection on the lens
but for this price its good filteri could get slow shutter with thislittle hard to open filter caseafter opening my package from amazon i immediately came back to the website to read reviews
was i really shipped a used filter when i ordered a new one
someone else had the same thing happen to them as what happened to me
my shipping was also delayed maybe i had to wait for someone elses rma to complete before i could have itwhat makes me think this filter was used
the huge fingerprint on the lens
not a hint of a fingerprint but a firm very visible print
it looked like csi already came by and dusted it as evidence before i ever opened the package
the cracks in the case
it looks like someone walked all over the plastic case the filter lives in
you cant crack these things by dropping them you need some force
the short black hairs inside the case
why are there hairs inside this
most new things are hairfree
some would even say clean in appearance
the scratches on the threads and the missing paint from the face of the filter
looks as if it were dropped
the damage to the threads however could only be produced by using the filter
making me believe it was previously used
maybe the csi used it after they captured fingerprints off of iti gave the product  stars because it looks to be good
but the actual product that i received i would give  stars
i was tricked
now i have to go to ups to return this only to have to order it again in the hopes of getting a new oneive had this filter for a couple of months now and have enjoyed using it
it truly is sunglasses for the lens
my only gripe is at times it is hard to screw into the lens
but again it stays on my main lens unless im shooting in low lightim an amateur photographer thats lucky enough to get sent all around the world
recently on a trip to alberobello italy i was taking pictures of trulli houses during sunset
i found the absolute location to take pictures of the houses on the hill the sun was in the perfect spot there was great contrast between the clouds above the sun and the rays of light shooting up into them but because the sun was only setting behind the hill and there was another  minutes before true sunset i was still essentially taking pictures of my light source i simply couldnt capture the scene like i was seeing it
i thought to myself man if only i had something like sunglasses for my camera
enter the neutral density filter
thats the best way i can explain it
as much as i enjoy tinkering with photoshop i much prefer to get the picture perfect at the camera and never even open photoshop
this nd filter allows me to tone down the lighting but still giving me the entire range of adjustments my d offers
ive found it works best theres slightly overwhelming light that you cant control and its produced some pretty interesting effects during sunset when i increase my exposure a bit
the filter is thin enough that i can stack it on top of my uv filter and it doesnt crop the frame on either mm or my mm that it fits on
the quality is great i have some no name filter that came with the  lens and it feels like it was assembled in a garage not so with the tiffen filterswhat can i say
it fit and it does what its suppose to do
it was a decent price and im happy with my purchaseits a nice lens cover that does what it says
it makes things a bit more vivid when shooting outdoorsthe tiffen mm neutral density  filter is a nice start with my experience with nd filters
give very good resultsjust wanted to throw some advice out there for those of you shooting video
i bought the  and  tiffen mm filters
i just did a test on an fs with a rokinon mm prime video lens
first off with my setup two filters cannot be stacked
the image turns soft
i didnt expect this based on the other reviews i read before buying these
with just one filter attached the  or  there is some mild to medium color shift or wb change i should say but nothing that cant be tweaked in post
and with just one of these filters attached i picked up some slight ghosting from a bright light source  a computer monitor framed in the upper left third of the shot reflected dimly in the lower right third of the shot
not severe enough to ruin the footage for me but its there
your cameralens combo may yield different results but at least as far as resolution is concerned the camera im using is sharp so i think its safe to at least trust the nostacking suggestion
cheersit screws on easily
it reduces the amount of light in to the lens
its well built
any other questionsi purchased this filter too use with a canon digital slr
i have primarily used this filter for longer exposures with waterfalls
it has worked great did not effect the quality of my images ether
great value for the moneythis attaches to my canon sxo using the adapter ringbeautifullyit fits snug and tightit tones down the lightingenabling great water shots without the over exposure so common on a sunny dayi own the mm thread set and use it with my fujifilm sfsthe sfs has a very close macro distance of about cm unfortunately only in the mm position of the lens
that leaves the object kind of small in the picture
to counter that i bought this closeup lens set
the three lenses work like a magnifying glass with different poweri generally only use the one with the greatest power and the results are very acceptable
i tried to use all three lenses together but that gives you noticeable degradation in picture qualitythose closeup lenses are by no means an alternative solution to a dedicated macro lens with extension tubes but if you have no choice like with a noninterchangeable lens camera like the sfs it is a very good workaround
what you get is a bit more creative freedom but it certainly is no silver bullet
nonetheless i am pleased with the quality of the pictures i get with the closeup lenses finding the greatest power lens the most usefultiffen are renound for making excellent filters and this set meets the expectations
i would recommend this product but was just unlucky with my purchase as the size was incorrect for nikon dslr lenses so i had to return the itemthis was very worth the money and allowed my lens to go closer to objects as expected
the quality isnt great but its just right for amateurs like mei take my camera to the beach for photographs
the filter acts as a barrier against mist being blown around in the humid atmosphere
i dont worry about wiping this filter down nearly as much as i do the lensthis is the second same filter of this brand that ive purchased
these uv type filters are pretty basic and meant mainly to protect the actual lens
these dont do much other than that
but thats why i purchased them for my daughters olympus epl and a nikon slr that i own
as someone else mentioned theres a bit of flare
strangely i dont notice it on the slr
at any rate its not enough to not recommend iton the other hand this ensenda shipping company stinks
they marked the package delivered yet it wasnt
i suppose its good for their statistics
not so good for customer service
hopefully youll be lucky and get fedex or upsim not a believer in the effectiveness of socalled uvhaze filters to do very much photographically but since they dont alter exposure and serve as protection for a potentially expensive lens underneath i bought one of these because i needed something to protect the glass in front of several old and expensive nikon rangefinder lenses
what can i say
it works and as far as i can tell the glass is sufficient to introduce no optical distortion
and of course the price is righti like tiffen filters
theyre metal and the glass is usually clear wellpolished and without waves or distortions
i have on occasion received one or two in which the glass was not firmly mounted in the frame and there was a bit of wiggle
nothing ever came of it so i just didnt worry about it
just have to nick tiffen  star for quality control
filter glass shouldnt rattle around in filter frame
periodend of discussion on that one
i still buy tiffen as their track record is on the winning side and they represent high valuei cant speak to the effectiveness of the haze reduction as i purchased this  for protecting my pentax mm lens
however i did choose this one over a base uv in the hopes that for long shots it might have some benefits at cutting hazei have not used much yet so cant comment of quality of filter
construction seems to be fine and it fits on lens as expectedi purchased this filter primarily to protect the front element of my mm nikkor lens
my secondary reason was to use it as a uv haze filter when taking panorama and landscape photographs
as far as a good lens protection filter id give it a full  star rating but now that ive used it i wish i would have purchased tiffens higher quality and more expensive uv haze filter
i find that this filter helps reduce the uv haze in my photos where its a factor but it doesnt totally eliminate it and its performance in this regard could be better
for its uv haze filtering capability id rate this filter a  star hence my overall  star ratingif youre looking for a decent lens protection filter for the price this filter is a good pick youll get some improvement in your hazy shots as a bonus
if filtering uv haze is a priority get the better modeli got this item because i wanted to make a scrapbook of my sisters baby showerbaby book for the expected baby
i had taken photos and created baby wishes card that i wanted to put together from the eventpro they hope the photo and cards real well
its easy to use and doesnt have bubbling
it doesnt feel flimsy and didnt feel cheap
the price is cheap so definitely will be getting these again in the near future for my next scapebookdoes as advertised
no problems or distortions as i can see
but i have issues with filters and flares and hot spots shooting towards the sun but use this mostly for protection and remove in special conditionsnot much to say about this its a good general uv filter
no problems with it nor anything stellar to write just nice protection for your lensthis was an accessory for a mm fl canon lens that i purchased separately
the filter works well during the day in bright light and otherwise conditions where the particular wavelength of bluegreen light is not present when in the dark  whether setting it up for long exposures of the night sky or for birthday pictures with the candles lit up  i still have to remove the filter to avoid ghosting
however at this price point i dont expect the filter to handle this and its kind of understood that i need to do thiswhy buy this 
i travel a lot  with my lenses and in my experience having an extra layer of glass over the lens in itself makes it easier to clean and one less thing to bother when considering minor spills or people trying to check out your lenses 
when i do need that clarity i take the lens filter off take a picture and back on goes the filter after its temporary housing in my back pocketive had previous lenses banged up  kit lenses  in the infancy of the art and another lens with milk shake on it lens face down on a mcds table  clumsy skier friend  milk shake accident  where a uv filter has resulted in lesser pain and loss
so id recommend this product if you know when to take it off and when to keep it on
it does its job and lets you do yours
edit  the filter did its job when my lens skid off a bench onto a hardwood floor
it was inside its leather cover but it was still a hard drop
the filter took the impact and shattered keeping the lens safe
i ordered another one and is on its wayplease note  the filter does have ghosting issues and thats true with all but the most expensive filters
the filters i use are for lens protection  both in case of accidents as well as to protect the glass from everyday grime and dust
when im shooting lowlight i take off the filter and put on the lens hood  works like a charm a must have  i would suggest getting it for all your lenses
typically they suggest it only for film cameras  for the way uv reacts with the film typically blue light
however there are some other schools of thought that suggest not putting cheaper glass in front of expensive lensesthis doesnt feel that way to me  suggest trying it out for yourself and check out the difference on many daytime photosi bought this filter to put on the front of the  dx lens on my nikon d
it works well and protects the front element of the lens from dust dirt fingerprints and whatnotit seems to cause a little vignetting slightly darkened corners at extreme wide angles mm  but from what ive seen so far it isnt terribly noticeable specially for the pricei cant give it a perfect  due to the fact that all uv protection filters are very much similar
the only differences is that some can distort your photos but safety first when dealing with any of your lensesworks perfect for my mm lens
it protects it from dirt and the occasional bumps
price is good compared to other non branded product
i always use tiffen for my camerasive had my nikor    for about  years without a filter on the front
simply never took the time to purchase one this size
a year ago i took a fall down a steep embankment and broke the sunshade that did provide protection for the lens limited  when i ordered the replacement lens hood i added this filter
i havent shot with it since i placed the filter on the lens so the jury is still out on that partbut the quality of the filter and ease of mounting it to the lens is what i want to see in a filtertiffen does not make the most expensive filter on the market but as long the focusing time and image quality are not degraded the difference in price between a tiffen filter and a bw is a savings i will take
offers good lens protection does not scratch easily and as long as you keep it dust free will reduce the uv haze and produce good picturesdoes exactly what i want protect the lens
quality enough for crystal clear pictures and inexpensive enough to replace immediatelyfits great on my canon ef mm f prime lens
i feel much safer with this on as an extra layer of protection for my lens for dust and scratches
be careful in certain lighting situations thoughthere may be funky reflections etcnote this is not a filter its a cover
dont expect anything morenice filter which works well to protect your much more expensive lens so keep it intact and protected
worth keeping in your camera bag to knock the ultra violet rays downthis was purchased along with the tamron mm lens for my canon t camera
everyone should know by now that it makes sense to include one of these on their camera to protect the lens itself from bangs bumps dust and dirtits a nobrainer really and tiffen has been in the filter business a very long time
trust me im old
worth the extra costgreat filter to protect my lens great service and quick delivery
the only problem i had is my canon l lens will have problems sometimes focusing with this filter ontiffen is a good mid price filter if you just want to protect the front element of your lens
i am satisfied if i was to spend more it would probably be for a hoyathis item protects your camera lens like it should
if you take a lot of hand held photos then every lens should have oneperfect for protecting my lens
i keep filters on all my lenses for mostly protection
this one give clear photosa uv filter is essential for any one with a dslr
it helps filter out harsh light and it also protects the actual glass of your lens
its better to have to pay  to replace a filter than paying  to replace a lensi bought this to replace an identical one that was broken when my camera slid down a plank and ran lensfirst into a sharp stone
i was surprised and pleased that it broke without shattering and protected my prime lens from any damagei recently had a mishap where i dropped one of my nikon zoom lenses and it landed facedown
the filter rim took the brunt of the fall so while the cap and filter glass were smashed the lens itself was thankfully intactget a clear or uv filter like this for each of your lenses as a safety precaution against scratches and other accidents that could ruin your perfectly good lens
this tiffen filter is a good option because its pretty affordable and comes in a size thats common among nikon lensesthis product provides your lens a protection barrier in case of a fall and also helps with uv rays
made of good sturdy materialsthis filter does what its name implies it protects your lens from scratches dust and other problems
thats about all this filter does but it does it well enoughthis could save you hundreds of dollars or in the case of a point and shoot the need to replace the entire camerathe glass was a little bit thicker than i was expecting but this is going in place of a lens cap on my fd mm f on my ae mm film body i inherited from my dadbought it because it was only around it is quite cheap
i definitely did not buy it for uv protection
i bought it just to protect the lens
glass is okaygood
nothing special
dont put this in front of costly lensesto be honest i just paired it with a new lense i bought to protect it
but it seems to be good quality and a good pricefilter works good for general use and protects against some of the light relection
i would purchase it againi use this filter as a permanent fixture on my lens
it fits great is easy to clean and does not interfere with my lens hoodso i was in the market for a uv filter and the prices can be all over the place
this is a great price for this filter
it is not the best quality option but is was better then my friends  filter she had so i strongly recommend it especially for beginnersits little more than some extra lens protection
its cheaper to replace a scratched lens filter than the front element of an expensive lens
easy to put on and take off
ive noticed no problems with this filtergreat price delivered without problems
it is on my lens to protect it which it does
it feels a bit thin or light but should work for most shooting projectsi just use these to protect the main lens from getting dirty or scratched
if this gets scratched or bent from dropping it i just throw it away and get another one
it is cheap lens insurance
plus it helps seal the lens from rainit fits my  lens great but in low light there are a lot of flares on the lens
looking into getting a tulip hood to fix the issue
i recommend anyone get a filter for your lens better to break a  filter than a  lenscameracost effective serves its purpose
im sure paying more for the better quality filter would be beneficial however this does the trick for me no dramasshipping and packaging both goodi now feel a lot safer with this filter on my lens
dont feel like i need to baby my camera as much nowonly down side is that in certain lighting you will get ghosting and weird stuff going on
use this when youre messing around and leave it off when you want the best qualityive had tiffen uv protection filters on my lenses for a couple of years and have been satisifed with them
sometimes there have been reflections in my photos and recently one of the uv filters developed a small scratch near the center where else
when i went to order a replacement i looked at reviews of other uv filters and saw several people recommending more expensive multicoated filters
id thought this tiffen was multicoated but its not
so even though it was  i ordered a sigma ex dg mm multicoated uv filter  it arrived today
i compared it with my tiffen and immediately ordered two more of the sigmaswhen the tiffen catches a reflection it looks like a reflection on any smooth surface bright and noticeable
when the sigma catches a reflection it looks like a reflection on a camera lens dark green and much less noticeablemost of the time it probably wont matter just as most of the time my inexpensive little pocket camera will do about as good a job as my good dslr
its for the rest of the time that i bought the expensive camera for the onceinalifetime pictures
the better equipment captures them better and in this case the price difference is only the primary purpose of this filter is to protect the newly purchased tamron lense from scratches and finger printstiffen makes a great product
this is the most important filter for your camera lens
dont skimp
i would buy againusing this on my canon f mm lens its fantastic
great price great quality cant go wrongthe tiffen mm uv protector works great as a lens protector and keeping some uv outfits my lens great
it helps protect my glass
pretty cheap investment to protect your glassi bought a ti as my first and only dslr and also purchased the uv filter
i have not noticed a big difference in image quality however it has helped protect my lense on several occasions
i would highly recommend getting a uv filter for that reason alone
the only negative is that the lense that came with the camera does not fog up when going from a cool building to the muggy hot outside climate that we have in louisiana however the filter does
so when i go outside i have to either wait five minutes for the filter to acclimate itself to the outdoor climate or take it off for a few minutes negating any benefits it may have for that period
its very easy to install threads on the lense so its only a minor inconvenienceprotect your camera lens by using a filter
this tiffen does the job at reasonable priceonly reason i didnt give a fill  stars was because while riding an airplane in my carryon camera backpack the filter cracked right across with no explanation while still on my sigma mm im thinking it might have been from the pressure it the cabin fluctuating
i dont know but it cracked with out even being physically touched by anything so yeah that was lame
loosen the filter before boarding airplanes to avoid the pressure differentiation behind the filter and you should be goodi bought this just for protection of my canon sx lens
i had to get a lens adaptor for thisamazon lumps together all the tiffen filter reviews
so unless you specify which specific filter you are reviewing no one will know
this makes all those reviews that say something like this filter made my pictures too darklightredgreenwhatever totally uselessamazon tends to lump together similar products like all or many cameras from one manufacturer so in general it is a good idea to specify the product you are reviewing in your amazon reviewsgreat price and service
items comes as described unit screw on perfect on my fuji hs exr
great product
no frillsif youre looking for an inexpensive filter to protect your cameras lens this is a great choice
i found that it scratched easier than i would like but for the price this does not bother meif you want a standard uv filter  here it is
good construction and works as expected
i own the mm also and it is the same qualityjust needed a simply protective filter for a lens  nothing fancy
this filter works just fine and at a fraction of the  that the camera shop was going to charge meall i wanted was a basic lens protector and this does the job well
the first filter i got from amazon had a bubble near the perimeter so i sent it back for a replacement
not sure if this is an unusual miss or a ding on tiffens quality
replacement was fine
amazon shipped the replacement the day i complained and paid for the return
go amazonjust a basic lens cover at a fair price
its a lot cheaper to scratch or damage this than the lens itselfwhat a relief to have the protection for the lens i have
it is very delicate
i use it close to the ground a lot and have confidence that only the protective lens will bet scratched
easy to remove and clean both sidesgood general purpose protective filteras with all of the filters i have purchased from tiffen nikon or bw it fit the need
nothing to get overly excited about but also nothing to get chafed about
it seems to be a quality productthere is nothing much a uv filter has to do so of course i cannot give it a  star or lesser rating
i have a uv filter from kenko and they seem much betterbut for the price i bought  who am i to complain this tiffen mm uv is really interesting resultswith wellmade fittings makes its main functions to protect the lens from uv and also preserve the main lensthe brightness is very goodnothing to complain about in my photosi use these currently as added protection for my lenses
the ones i bought from amazon all had a promotion for a free mm filter
who am i to turn it down
i havent noticed too much image degradation altho in certain low lights i have seen some flaring and ghosting
however the main use for me is to have an added layer of protection from the elementsi got this filter for my sigma  telephoto lense  years ago
so far so good with no complaints or issue
it s fit like a glove and provided protection for my lens surface and some enhancement to picture
so heres the low downpro
quality glass from trusted name of tiffen
easy to use mutiple lens compatible and easy to clean
provide good protection to lense and photographic enhancementcons
a bit pricy compared to other just as good filter like zekiosbottomlinewhile is a bit pricy and other substitue are widely avialable
im very happy with this filter and will recommend other to the productdmanthis unit does the job
i have had good luck with tiffen
would recommend it to anyone that needs a filteri bought this filter to protect a canon  mm fcanon ef mm f ii camera lenslensit does what is supposed to and no more
it is not multicoated so there is no great reduction in flare but for the price is is a solid wellconstructed filterquality products
tiffen filters have been around forever and this one does its job as expected
i bought one for each of my new lensesa decent little piece of protection
i keep one on all my lenses at all times in fact i dont think ive ever taken a picture without some sort of filter on my lens
after all its much easier to replace a scratched filter than it is to repair a scratched lensthere are some flares and reflections if youre not careful about where the sun is in your photos
but if you cant shed the money for a multicoated higherend filter this one is certainly good enoughi got this filter for use with mycanon efs mm f is telephoto zoom lens for canon digital slr camerasand have been fairly satisfied with it
i am not sure how much of uv protection this filter gets  my primary purpose was to get something that protects my lens under the everyday working conditions
the built of the filter feels very solid and i trust it to get the protection job done
i use the zoom lens primarily outdoors in nondirect natural light so i have not experienced any of the light reflection problems that other reviewers have hadthe filter is a great help to protect the lens remove some glare and allows clean colors to flow to the lensnice filter
easy to use
just screw it on and go
use it to protect my lens cause easier and cheaper to replace than a lensis a must with an expensive lens
i have not experienced any negatives with this filter like some reviewers havelike many others i use uv filters mostly for lens protection
i have one on every lens i own and i simply replace them as they wearso far i have tested only the macro mode of this lens and with that i am very pleased
this well made tamron lens produces very pleasing results on a grandkids face using minolta d and wireless flash  actually beautiful results
good compatibility with my d and wireless flash
great aperature control yielding sharp focus of all parts of the head while background christmas tree is reduced to soft out of focus sparkles large aperture and high speed shutter
this lens is worth its price for its macro mode only
anxiously awaiting opportunites to test the quality of the mm reach of this lens on my backyard birdsalthough this protector works very well and my pics were not distorted i was really looking for a clear protector not a uvi bought this uv filter for lens protection
i am very happy with the construction and performance but a little unhappy with the cleaning they gave itpros good quality of construction not the best if you want a great one try multicoated great image improvement for low budget probably the best feature inexpensive important it leaves front capacity to put another threadaccesory for the mmcons it didnt came clean as i expected
for a lens filter you hope for a better state
it could be the packing or some trouble on the storeoverall if i had to classify the filter on the uvs not coated it could stand between a sigmadg mm great one and the cokin mm very low construction and lens quality i own on my sony ai use the tiffen filter with my eos ti  ef mm  iii purchased this filter to protect the lens on my canon hf and it does the job well
it protects against dust and scratches and attaches without any difficulty
i will however be purchasing a coated filter once i begin using the camcorder outdoors this summer
i am considering the canon filters for about  on amazoncanon fshu mm filter set for canon hf hf  dc camerasnice way to protect the lens
no glare or issues with the threads as far as screwing it into placetiffen has long been a name known for quality filters
of the lowerpriced filters they are probably the bestgood product
feets my needs amateur photographer
maybe not the greatest filter but good value for the cheap price you paypurchased this to protect the lens
cannot really say about how much uv filtering it does
no adverse effects noted and the front of the lens is clear and moisture free
this is a standard item to purchase for each lens in any photographers kit
with digital there isnt as much of a problem with uv or excessive blue in a photo skylight filter fixed that as there is with film
this is a good productonly really using it for lens protection
works just fine for that
price is right for what you get
i see no reason to pay more for a better filteralthough used the filter was not damaged or scratched in any way
very affordable and worth the chance you sometimes take with a used productthe price was right to protect the front element of your lenses will protect me from any damage caused by accident sturdy buildnever buy a lens without a uv filter to go over itim just starting out with photography as a hobby so take this review for what its worth
i got this filter to go on a nikon afs dx lens attached to a d camera primarily as a inexpensive way to protect my lens from dirt and getting scratched
i can say that the filter seems well constructed with an anodized aluminum bezel that screws firmly to the lens and still allows use of the original lens cover
the glass is easily kept clean with just a lens cloth and so far no scratches
i have not seen any ill effects of using the filter though so far i have only taken shots outside during the day and have not taken comparison shots with the filter on and offthis is the second one i have purchased since the first one broke when my  year old got a hold of the camera
i did have one case where this filter was putting spots on the pictures
it was inside with christmas lights creating the problem
other than that it has always worked well stars only because it took me around  mins to slowly screw this on the camcorder
it can be shifted or uneven when you put it on easily
so i have to take it off and rescrew on a few times until i get it right in the groves
the camcorder video comes out greati tested with it on and off and i can not tell its there when i watch the video in hdgl and enjoythere are different brands and different qualities of filters out there and ive found that tiffen is a name i can count on
i use this as a permanent protection on the front of my lens as well as its stated purpose  uv protection of course
i dont know what else i can say beyond that  its an excellent filter has excellent quality and does a great job of what its designed to dofeels solid
fit great
no issues so fargoing to shoot some more with it on and then determine if it effects my shots in any negative waysthis is my first filter for my first dslr camera
i put this on my lens and it never had any issues
i do not have any benchmark to compare it against but it protects my lens and doesnt come off from the lens so i guess its working as expectedif you going to leave a filter on while you are shooting get the best filter you can afford
good lens protection though for the pricepackaging of first filter was a very simple thin cardboard box like a cigarette case with plastic bag full of glass shardsthey kindly replaced the item quickly and in better packaging and it works greatdoes what its meant tonot much more to be said
it is a filter afterallian smithdunedin new zealandi got this tiffen mm uv protection filter for my canon ef mm f ii lens
it fits live a glove and protects the lens well
so far i havent noticed any image deterioration or side effects
for  a pop id recommend it to anyonethis is a solid filter
it does the job well
i would recommended it to anyone looking for a good uv filterits a great filter for the price
im no professional but it protects my lens which is all i neededno problems with this filter
using it on a nikon  vr and it works just finethis lens filter seems pretty standard it is made of glass and feels like its good qualityits always worth investing in one of these lens protectors instead of having to buy a new lens if something goes wrongthe case in which the lens protector comes doesnt seem to hold onto it very well
if i shook the package i could see and hear the lens bouncing aroundother than that its a standard protection filter that is worth the overall investmentworks well
review could change based on its purpose to protect the lens
im happy for now
works as expectedgreat price does its job
it is not as good as my b  w mc uv filter i have for my l lenses
the main difference is flare
cheaper uv filters like this one are way more prone to optical flares
especially in low light when a light source is present in the frame
such as a street lamp
i have  mc uv filters and they too are more prone to flare than the bare lens
my philosophy cheaper lens then save the money and get a uv filter like this one
expensive lens
grab a b  w multicoated filter
cant go wrong with this one thoughuv filters come in handy for taking some haze out of skies and such
but even more important uv filters art very inexpensive so they are also a great investment for protecting your lenses
the first time i went to yosemite i jumped out of the car so fast that the camera slipped out of hands
the camera landed lense first and i had a  vr on the camera body
the only thing that happened was a cracked inexpensive filter
a must for any photographer
john crippen photographer and writeranimal portraits with the digital photography of john crippen learning photography with animalsno to much to say
its a camera filter and it works
shipping and packaging were greatbout this filter to keep my second lens from getting dusty and scratched up
quality not the greatest but worth the  to be protectedoverall it does what its supposed to do
im not sure if the photo quality is better because of this filter thoughi have had this filter on my lens for years
it does a great job and not only providing uv protection but protects my lensif youre an amateur and doesnt use l glasses then this is a great additioni mainly uses it to protect my kit lens from scratches because digital camera does not need uv filterthe quality is comparable other more expensive brandsa basic protection item you should have
does not appear to be multicoated as the more expensive hoya filters are but clearly worth it
fits the nikon mm ed perfectly and allows the nikon lens hood to fit wellthe filter seems to be well made
i wish it had come in silver to match the lens but other than that it appears to be good quality and adequate to the job of protecting your lens and reducing uv hazeok you know that a uv filter helps block some of the same pesky uv light that causes tans and skin cancer
by doing this it also makes your pictures look more like you remember the scene
also if you ever drop the camera its better to have to replace a twenty dollar filter than a  lens
nuf saidi shoot outdoors in blowing dust and dirt
this does the job and protects the lens from impacts
no weird colors or other issuesit is a simple item and it performs its intended function no more no less
i got it as i always do to protect the front of my lensi bought this for my canon vixia hfs and it does what i wanted it protect the lensimages still look greatyou can spend much more on filters and i can tell you that they are  worth it but until i get some more cash this will work great not to mention the fact that it will make a great cover for rougher adventuresprotects my expensive lens investment
does what i need it to threaded on very smoothly
love the tiffen brand and have never had any problemfine everyone
this is a lens protect for your very expensive lens
it does the job well
reeses peices
what else can i say about iti used this filter in conjunction with my nikkor mm lens
it works well keeping my lens protected however i guess due to the uv coating i would get a bit of unwanted glare when shooting at certain anglesbut solid nonethelessthe filter is pretty standard and as always amazon has made it easy and affordable showing why they are without a doubt the best place to shopel filtro estaacute muy bien ningun problema con las construccioacuten y cumple con el pbjetivo opara el que fue hecho
por el precio estaacute bienanother extra for our jvc hd camcorder i got this really only to help keep the camera lens cleaner
i liked the idea of the self closing lens cover but also felt that this filter in front of those covers would protect the lens even better
i received it very fast and it fits perfectly on the camcorder
in bright outdoor shooting no issues
in some less bright locations i do feel that it made the auto focus less accurate and did take it off a few times then
overall still a good expense less than  so im glad i got itthe filter does the job as advertised protects the front glass element of the lens
being an uncoated filter there was a slight amount of ghosting but nothing seriousthe uv filter is not as strong as it could be however this filter is more meant as a protector for your lens and it does that perfectly wellhard to rate this beyond its basic function as a filter
ive used tiffen filters for years and they seem to work and wear well
time will tell more with this one
if you want an inexpensive extra barrier for your glass this is a good optionso far it looks good quality is oki am taking one star cause it looks as it gets dirty easier than other cheap filters
i also notices some reflections on some pictures
however both dirtiness and reflections may have been caused by specific circumstances under which it was usedi will update later if this behavior stops up to  stars or to lower it if it gets worse probably to  starsright now  stars seems fine mainly because it is good quality at a very low pricethis seems to be a fairly basic cover for your expensive lens
simply this is good insurance
the optics looks perfectly fine to me
i can discern absolutely zero difference between photos taken with  and without  the filter applied
that said the filter arrived covered in white dust and i was suprised that they didnt include a cheap lens wipe in the packagein the forever debate over whether to have a filter or not i choose filter
i know that a hood is going to protect the glass as well but this can also protect
ive been one of those people that have managed to seriously gash my lens on my canon powershot point and shoot and got a little scratch on my sigma mm recently
no clue how these happened but i do know that when it comes to my canon  im not taking many chancesfor this filter specifically i will say that i havent seen any degradation or problems during normal use
the one thing i have seen is lens flare
shooting with this during concerts or towards the sun definitely can give extra flare
if im shooting towards lights filter off if im really worried about picture quality possible future large prints filter off just to be sure i dont lose anything all the other times filter onits good for protection against dust and scratches to actual lens
easy to mount and came in a protected casingi got this because i need for my new l frame
its actually pretty cheap and the quality of tiffen is pretty goodtiffen is a decent uv filter if you are looking for simple cheap protection for your lens
b  w filters are known to be top quality
if you are willing to spend the money then go for that onecheap uv filter that protects expensive lenses
this doesnt do wonders for photo quality or anything but will protect the lens from getting scratched
good priceso far so good
i used this mainly for lens protection and it doing it job
nice price  great buyi bought one of these to protect my lensbaby g and other than the occasional reflection from a very strong light source it does a great jobi bought the new canon d and looking for lense protector and uv filterthis is pefectly fitting my camera working greati bought this filter for a mm lens so im not concerned that it is thick
for my mm i spent the extra money to get a thiner filter
i have not stacked filters on either lens so i am unsure if the added thickness matters
if you plan on using this just to protect your lens then it is good and cheapwell this works
but please dont buy an eight dollar filter for a  dollar lens
you can always spend up to  of the lens cost in buying protective gear for themmy husband got this for his canon camera
we live in the desert so he wanted to make sure he had a filter
this one certainly works welllike many photographers will tell you it is good to buy one of these fitters even if it is just to protect your valuable lens
i wouldnt be without thisdid the job and the price was rightthe filter not only protects from the uv rays but it also helps protect from scratches and everyday usagei like tiffin equipmentfor the cost i found this filter that i use mainly to protect my lense front element to do exactly what is expected
i have not noticed any loss in qualitythis was an expediency purchase basically
uv filters are a good thing to put on a decent lens
it is just fine for what is does and all that needs to be said is tiffen makes a dependable filterdont spend too much money
this is great
i keep it on my lens at all time as a protection as wellit seems to provide the protection and filtering i desired so this product would seem to be doing the jobnice filter and extremely clear but it did have a slight flawbubble or something on the very edge
however its not noticable when i take a picture so for the price i didnt even bother to ship it back since its just cosmetic
great product for the money and very pleased with supplier
shipping got it here in a just a few days even though the tracking number showed it coming in about  weeksas it was made for i havent noticed that it exists
 i even noticed any distortion or aberration when taking picturesit was cheap
it protects the front element on my lens
i have not used it discriminately enough to decide if to decide it there is any distortion or degradation to my picturei used these for years and was completely satisfied
if this is what your budget allows then its a very good choicesolid build just not much use to me
it slows down the lens and dont over any more protection
the lens hood on the other hand is very helpful in that regard
software ps canons dpp acdsee is far more effective in removing haze than this
i bought a few filters of various kind out of curiosity in the beginning now they are all collecting dust if you do any outdoor photography a uv filter is an absolute necessitytiffen is a name brand as far as i am concerned and you could do worsei have had many tiffen filters in the past and have bene very happy with them so choosing this one was a nobrainer for mewhat i liked the overall quality of the glass strength and durability of the screw ring the pricewhat i do not like from past experience the glass can get easily and permanently stained if you use alcohol based cleaners  caveat emptor it can be damagedfogged up if you are using a compressed air duster  so use a hand blower to get rid of any dry particlesbought this for canon ef mm fl is usm telephoto zoom lens first as protection and second to reduce haze does a great work on bothi am not a professional but i think this is a good item especially around noon when the sun is very brightit is just a piece of glass that protects your lens but i filters saved my expensive lens before and i cannot image not having one on every lensi bought this to protect lens and it does its job
price was right
not sure how it affects imagesi actually bought two of these one for each lens
they are easy protection for the lenses and work just fine
i almost did not try these because other reviews talked about bad  threads and difficulty with taking on and off
i found no such problems and they screw on smooth and easythis filter does its job just fine
i havent done any real tests to see if there is significant image distortion but it goes onoff the lens well enough
it was just a little hard to get started threading but that seems to be getting easierevery serious camera buff needs to protect their lenses by placing a protective layer over the glass
uv filters give that protection without interfering with the sensor readings
tiffen is a good filter maker reasonably priced with quality products
i highly recommend all serious new photographers to invest in a uv filter to protect their lensesworks well for its intended purpose to protect my lens and keep it from getting scratched and chipped easy insuranceour older filter broke when my  year old dropped the camera quite by accident
this new filter fit my nikon d and functions as expectedi got this filter for my nikon d for use with my nikon mm fg afs dx lens
filter screws in smoothly and still has enough lip to accept the stock lens cap
i often throw on this filter when i am taking pictures of family as it has saved my camera lenses from fingerprints from grabby kiddos on more than one occasionnormally i would have never used something like this but i invested in the canon  l usm and thought i should protect my investment
im glad i did
i dropped my lens front element down and shattered the filter
im glad it wasnt the front element that shattered
however i would recommend a plastic thread if you can find it
if you are accident prone like myself you will like the fact that plastic just breaks
since this filter has a metal ring and thread after i dropped it the lens the metal ring bent instead of snapped
removing the the thread was a pain via plierswire cutters  oil filter wrench wont do it and the filter thread on my lens was useless because of the bending too
if you can dont drop your lens if you know you might drop your lens put a uv filter on it just in caseit fit my purposes nicelyyou spent a lot of money for your slr or digital slr camera and then you plunked down another large chunk of cash for a quality lens
do you really want to blow another heavy chunk of change for a basic thread on uv filter
well i would normally advise that you dont skimp on quality when it comes to filters
after all would you pay a premium price for a high performance automobile only to fill it with watered down fuel
i should nope not
so is it such a bright idea to buy such a low cost uv filter for your highend slr lens
well maybe it is if you are considering the tiffen mm uv protection filterthis filter does not offer the highest level of uv filtration but it is rather sufficient for most conditions and the build quality and materials used in this filter are very good
for most digital slr users a uv filter is a must have for protecting your lens optics and it helps to clear up the hazy and washed out look in many of your outdoor photos
this filter has proven to clean up many of my digital photographs and i have found almost no internal reflection artifacts
notice i said almost no internal reflection
i leave my uv filters on all of my lenses almost all of the time and this filter has produced some minor reflection when shooting indoor photos with my sigma mm ultrawide angle lens
this seems to only happen when shooting in dim lighting conditions and when aiming the lens in the direction of a strong light source such as a table lamp
since my canon eos d has a live view feature that lets me see what the picture is going to look like displayed on the  lcd i can see the reflection artifacts before i shoot the picture and therefore have found ways to reframe my shots to avoid the reflections
however i recommend that you simply remove the uv filter when shooting in these conditionsas i said before i typically do not recommend buying low cost filters for your high quality lenses but i prefer to invest my money on creative filters and not pour too much into a filter that is primarily used to simply protect the front of the lens
many manufacturers including tiffen offer higher quality uvhaze filters for slr lenses and you may wish to spend the extra money if you are looking for deeper uv removal from your pictures
however if you are looking for great lens protection and a decent level of uv filtration for a modest investment you honestly cant go wrong with this filter
just remember to remove the filter or frame your shots carefully when shooting in situations where direct light reflection may be an issuequality   uv filtration   value   one should always purchase a protection filter when purchasing a new lens for your camera
at least that is what i taught in the photo classes i conductedit is fairly streamlined and mounts onto the lens pretty well without interfering with the lens hood
works well to protect the front of the lens tooseems to do what it is supposed to do
for the price simply protecting the lens underneath is all i expect of iti picked this up to protect the lens and innards of mycanon vixia hfs
even though it has an automatic lens cap a shutter that opens when you turn on the camera theres still a chance of getting dirt and other debris both on the lens and in and around the lens casing
its much easier to keep this clean than to get in to the actual lens and clean itanyhow this seems to be solidly built
it screws in easily and is as far as i can tell perfectly clear
just what i neededif you do pick this up for use with the hfs its probably also worth ordering acanon eu mm snapon accessory lens cap to minimize the need to wipe this off every time you pull it out of the casei use this filter with my  mm nikon lens and i have another  mm with a  mm nikon lens i dont have problems with them and help me to protect my lenses i recomend this uv filters and this brand because is cheap and usefull
the filters dont affect my photosi bought this primarily as an extra layer of protection for my lenses and have been pleased with the results
you simply screw the filter on to the lens and youve added a cheap layer of protection to the end of your lens
my small gripe is that if youre working in cold or humid conditions it will fog up considerablyback in my mm days we always added a uv filter to protect the fragile outer glass lens
being old school i thought to be a good idea to cover up my new  mm lens on my canon dlsr
i purchased the filter along with a new mm lens from amazon
two days later my package arrived as expected
the tiffen has a stout metal ring and crystal clear glass nicei wish this filter was multicoated but ive used basically the same uv filter for years on all my lenses from my old minolta srt slr back in the late s to my recently purchased digital panasonic fz highend compact zoom
your lens is the heart of your photo capture system and stuff happens from bumping it to dropping it to splashing it or getting dust and sand on it outdoors etc and this is the best way i know to keep it like new for years to come
if you do have an accident youre looking at replacing the filter for  instead of a major lens or camera repair bill or total camera replacement
i believe you should always and immediately slap on a good quality name brand uv filter for protection every time you buy a good camera with a nonretracting lens youll be so glad you did in the long run
all my old cameras with good lenses still have them installed on them
my old minoltas lens looks and performs exactly as it did the day i bought it
so protect that lens from scratches and damage and get some bonus uv filtering to boot
and yes the lens cap does fit over the filter and provides another important layer of protection so be sure to replace it whenever the camera is not in useits just a protection filter
its does a good work by day though it can create weird flares by night if you are trying to picture below a bright light or if theres one pointing towards youit also has a weird glass finish in the edges that make it look cheap even though it isnothing fancy just a well priced filter used to protect the glass element in my new lens
i have bought tiffen before and will buy againmy daughter dropped my nikon dslr with my mm lens
it seemed like nothing happened and i put camera away
when i was ready to use and i opened the lens the protection filter was all broken  luckily it had protected my original nikon lens and all i had to do was buy another filter
this filter is great and it protects your equipment
it is a mustits not leica glass but its a very nice filter that does what it is suppose to do
test it by shooting two shots of same landscapeone with it  one without
plus it does protect your lens
buy one for each of your valuable lensthis is permanently on my long lens and is great
good fit doesnt alter the speed of lens or distance ratio
not much more i can say
order away an dont lose but it does screw on welli purchased this filter to protect my canon mmmm lens
i always buy filters to protect my lenses from scratches dirt and debris
also the reds are toned down but not even noticable by ameteur photographers or anyone in general
this filter serves its main purpose for me protectionwhat can i say
this is a nice and inexpensive accompaniment for my l lens
it was nice to have them both delivered at the same time and start shooting right away and not run off to camera store to buy uv filternice feature for amazon to bring the accessories to your attention at check out timewhat can i say
it does the job and doesnt appear in my photos
that is the best one can say for a uv filterits always a good idea to have a uv filter even if you dont feel uv is a problem
at the least the filter provides protection for that much more expensive chunk of glass right behind it
i purchased the tiffen to go on the kit lens of my sony a and have not noticed any offcoloration or loss of contrast
i have no problem buying more from tiffeni bought this filter to attach to the front of my sigma mm digital camera lens
i cannot see any lowering the quality of the images taken with this filter attached
this was a good price for this filterthe product is well made and would for sure protect a lens from breakage but it is not coated to prevent secondary reflectionsi bought this tiffen filter to protect the lens of my lumix digital still camera
tiffen has always been a fine brand for filters
this one serves the purpose of protecting the camera lens  and that is what i bought it for
no complaintstiffen makes some of the very best filters
these work perfectly with any canon
i bought these along with ploarised filtershave been using this on my tamron mm  for video
ive had a few scenes that had glares on them but other than that it does the job just finethere is ongoing debate over the use of uv filters
if you buy an expensive lens why cover it up with a cheap piece of glass
or why not take a cheap but effective insurance policy on your expensive lens
which brand is the best
while that debate rages and while you search for and save up for the ultimate perfect uv protection filter just go ahead and pick this one up
this is a really good and cheap way to test drive uv filterswhy
the price is cheap enough that its not a huge loss to your wallet and its a cheap and usually unobstructive method of keeping your glass protected from dings scratches and perhaps dropsconstruction is satisfactory enough
you can tell where the metal meets the glass it isnt the most precisely cut piece of glass but after having two both survive a year of my carelessness they are still going strong
the rim is made out of good quality metal and screws smoothly into my canon efs mm f ii lens for eos digital slr rebel xt xti d  d digital camerascanon efs mm f is telephoto zoom lens for canon digital slr camerasandcanon ef mm f macro usm lens for canon slr cameras
havent had any threading issues at all
it also cleans very easily with lens solution and microfiber cloth
the original lens caps also still fit onto this filter though they will sit a little higher than beforei keep these on most of the time and i havent noticed any image quality loss issues between when i do have them and when i dont
however i dont spend my time magnifying pixels on my shots
that being said this filter isnt without its faults
its susceptible to ghosting issues and flare issues as mentioned in other reviews
however those problems are pretty rare in my experience and so obvious when i see it in the viewfinder that i just take the filter off for those shots and put the filter back on when im back to walking around
it is sometimes inconvenient but i dont expect perfection at this price and a little inconvenience now and then is worth protecting the lensyou could obviously do better when purchasing a uv filter but you will probably have to pay for it
in this price range however its hard to go wrong with this filter
i have other cheap uv filters and those filters have obvious flaws in image quality
with this filter you will know when its flaws are acting up and you can deal with it on the spot
if youre a new photographer or a budget photographer who wants to keep their lens protected until they are comfortable shelling out more cash for a more reputable filter this is the way to goi have two of these though ill admit that i got them free as an promotion from amazon when i purchased two of my lenses through them
for the price and substantial quality you get for that price i would gladly buy it again if neededuv lens filters are pretty common stuff
rumor has it that there are only a few sources in the world and the product is package differently
tiffen seems to have a pretty good reputation and the price was righti purchased this filter not for its filtering capability which is quite adequate but rather for protection of the exterior surface of a new canon efs mm f usm ultrawide zoom lens
i place uv or skylight filters on all my lenses for protectionjust as expected
this product fits my lens nice and tight
this is a great way to protect you lens from finger prints and water spotsi just use this for protection in dusty or sandy or saltwater situations and it works wellnothing fancy just a piece of glass to keep your good lens from being scratcheddamaged from uv rays or errant drops
way cheaper than ritz camera and i notice no distortion
if youre reading this go for itwhen you are using your camera you need a uv filter on top of what ever other filters you want for the lens
i bought this so that i would have a uv on all of my lens without having to change them outthen you can easily add another filter for lights for anything that you wishthis is a tiffen mm uv protection filter
the operative word is protection
this lens protector is ok a uv blocking filter is only needed on a film camera
digital sensors never see uv light
so this is a stupid accessory for filtering light
anyway if i spent more i would end up with a better image since a  filter from bw for instance gives better results
no uv filter helps the image
they all result in less contrast and less sharpness
but if you have an expensive lens you might want to protect the front element
i do
so i put up with the slightly degraded image
this filter is cheap and the images are still fine for me
if i was a pro i might decide to forgo the filter and risk the front element
a lens hood such as the one on my mm macro keeps the front element protected pretty well so maybe i will decide to forget the uv filter one of these days
but when i get a shiny new l series lens i kind of dont want to expose that pretty glass to any risk
instead i put up with reflections flares and lower contrast
what is wrong with mefilter offers what i wanted  basic economical lens protection for my camera
the threads were not as finely milled as i would have liked but for the cost it is oknot much to say for this
the filter is clear fits the lens and protects the glass
it is relatively inexpensive and i believe it to be the industry standard
great productbought this to protect my kit lens
im not one to put extra glass in front of my lenssensor but this guy hasnt had any noticeable effect on pictures
and it took the brunt of an impact after the camera slipped off my shoulderat the price id definitely pick another one of these up if i ever needed toive been using it for some time and obviously i have had no problems with it
so its worth the pricethis is one of those must gets if you cherish your micro  lens
sadly on the olympus ep it sticks out a bit not really annoying but since the mm lens on the ep retracts so nicely youll immediately notice that the lens isnt as compact as it used to bestill better to have a small filter sticking out than damage your  lensquality of the filter is fine but then again there isnt much you can mess up on a uv filterthis uv filter does it job to protect the lens well
the build is solid metal construction
the glass is also descent qualityabout the performance it absorbs some uv light
the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable probably the sky a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for menow about the one problem which is the internal reflection
ive heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting
i found out that it is not caused directly by the low lightnight situation
the internal reflection will appear when there is a strongbright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure the surrounding environment
to put it in example which hopefully is easier to understand when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection
as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sidescorner of the picture and not in the center of the picture the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear if you move the light far enough from the center
and if the light isnt too brightcontrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection
but of course most of the time a lamp at nightime is often very bright
but the point that im trying to make is that the internal reflection doesnt happen all the time during low light or night timeadditionally the internal reflection isnt only happening at night
it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example
basically same rule as above on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the sidedissapear also depending the angle
but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situationshope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation which is not hard to doim actually not a fan of lens filter any filter as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens
and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you dont have any filter for your lens yetthe filter screwed perfectly into my lens and if nothing else it protects your lens from uv and the glass on the lens from fingerprints very helpful if you have small children
as others noted there are better filters but this will do fine for mosti put this filter on my sigma mm macro lens and it works just fine
the lens hook that came with the sigma works with this too
however the other hood i have does not work with this filter it does not line up right and show up in some wide angle shots
i dont know if its the filter or the hood but since the factory hood works ill be sending the extra hood back and keeping the filterwhen i purchased this uv filter i had low  in mind because i was going to be using it on a lens that i paid under  for and wouldnt be using all that often
every lens needs a uv filter for protection and it actually does a pretty good job
for some of my more expensive lenses ive gone with hoya multicoated or bw filters but the bottom line is this tiffen filter works good for a low price like  or soi bought this filter to protect the glass of my mm lens
it suits the purpose just fine and doesnt affect image quality that i can tellthis uv filter works fine on my sony a
the panasonic dmc fz i bought it for on the accessories part of amazon recommended it and it is not the right size for thati guess everyone but me knows to double check the small accessories that amazon says go with a unit
taught me to be more careful at least when im buying adapters batteries etc have not had a problem sinceby the way its a good quality filteri bought this for my nikon  vr lens and it works just as it should
it keeps the front of my lens safe from impact while not interfering with any of the lens or camera functions
id rather buy  of these cheap filters than having to replace or repair my lenscame on time and does what its supposed to do at a great price
i have order many tiffen filters in the past and will continue to order from this company
prices are greati am not a photography expert but have taken many photos over the last  years
the filter seems to be exactly what was advertised though i have not done any testing of it other than to use it
no problems
seems to be well made
got it mainly to protect main lensif i needed another uv protection filter i would not hesitate to get another one of thesewas delivered promptly and well packagedgave  stars instead of  because i dont have a way to completely test its ability to deal with uv problemsthis is inexpensive uv cover lens mostly for protection of the actual  lens glass itself
as for nighttime shots i did see ghosting and doubles of light reflections
for me if i am doing night shots it just comes off
i also have more expensive ones which when shopping you can read the description which advices of you of the coating and glass type of which will not have ghosting but it will cost  times as much
if you take loads of night shots or indoor party shots i suggest buying the better glass or having extra lenses
i have both so i am covered and understand that photography in general is not a cheap hobby or profession when it comes to equipmenti purchased the mm version for my alpha nexn with mm lens
it easily screwed into the lens and i love the feeling that my lens is protected
the only caveat is that i am definitely aware of the green flare that pops up in some of my pictures especially when shooting at a hard light source which is a bit annoying
however i really bought this filter for protection and its easy removable if i dont want to compromise my shotsits works to serve its purpose
this is good to protect your cameras expensive lens at a very cheap price better to scratch a  lens cover that a  lensno complaints on this one
does a great job on atmospheric haze and protects the front element of my lens
exactly what i neededordered a couple of new lens and use this filter to protect the lens
with the way modern lens are made a uv filter really isnt needed so i pop this on so the lens doesnt get scratchedgot a good canon lens with is and just trying to protect it  nothing special about this filter
that said ive always had good results with tiffen productscheap and works does not take any quality away from pictures it is a little big though
you cannot use this and another filter or you will get some vignettingits a good filter
period
not much to say about it
i will probably buy more soon for my other lensesi purchased this filter with the sole purpose of keeping my lens clear of scratches knowing that if a scratch does occur i can replace the filter for less than  rater than replacing a  lens
once i added the filter however i noticed that my outdoor pictures seemed much crisper and clearer than before
this is a great deal for the priceyou need a uv filter in front of your lens
simple as that
tiffen is qualityfor the price i pay this filter services the purpose
this filter does not affect the image quality of my shots
it is on my lens all the time for protection
now i dont have to take off and put back on my lens cap during a shooting sessionits not the best but im perfectly happy with this one
its not costly and it protects your lens
thats what i wantedits always better to have your lens protected if something bad happens you gotta spend only few bucks to buy a new protection filter not lens
sun flares are possible to be seen on pictures sometimesproduct came pretty fast and it does the job
its mainly a protection for my lens and the uv protection is minimal but the fit was great construction of the lens is glasswhat do you say about a filter
it works it fits and it protects my lensremember to get a clip hood thoughhow do you gain the long term customer is the fast turnaroundthe slowest release for shipment evernot the transient time is slow but the release by the sellerseems to do the job
no complaints
not sure what all the fuss is about but it has been ok for mepretty good filter for the price being offered
my criteria was to have the lens protected from dust and wear
pretty much happy with this filteri ordered  tiffen  mm uv filters for the  lenses that came with my nikon d
one filter was fine the glass in the other filter was loose in the ring
i immediately returned the defective filter to amazon and they promptly sent me a new one
i am pleased with the filters and amazons customer service
i just bought  tiffen photo essentials scontaining the uv protector  warming filet and circular polarizer
all of these filters appear to be okit protects the lens
but i still have glare from light sources i think this filter needs better coating
but hey it protects the lensi use this filter on my  mm prime and it does not add any weight or size to the already small lens
works exactly as described and have not had any distortion or deterioration in terms of captured image colorclarity
definitely recommendedit fits tight and doesnt rattle like other filters i have come across in the past
havent had any issues with it affecting my shots
good filter for the moneythis filter mounted on the lens nicely and the mating appeared perfect
the lens cap snaps easily into the grooves providedtransaction was great and on time
this filter was purchased as a protective cover for the lens on a new canon camera
i immediately installed it and it will stay on the lens until i wish to change to a different filter
tiffen workmanship is excellentthe filter looks and feels good except when i got mine
the locking ring wasnt tightened down all the way
i was lightly wiping the lens and i heard a slight rippingtearing sound and the glass lens can rattle inside the the frame
at first i thought it was glued down and i had ripped the glue off
i took a closer look and saw that you can tighten down the locking ring by using a small flathead and turning the ring with one of the  notches along the ring
after that it was sturdy and no more problemsthe outside of the ring is threaded to allow use of multiple filters or lensthe price was good on this which is why i bought it
i have had it for a while and use it a lot
the glass has become loose over time so i will probably replace it at some pointseems to be fine i havent had an flare action from this lens protector
so i seems fine
lighter weight than a bw i purchased separatelyactually i bought it for a protection of my lens
i think it should be good and worthy to owning it for your expensive lensthis uv filter is a must for protection of any good lens
my friend had one on his lens and the filter broke but the lens was flaw lessthere isnt much to say about something as simple as a filter
these fit together and work together well and the polarized filter eliminates almost all glarethe only trouble i see is that the temperature of an image changes quite a bit when you rotate the polarizer
in general it tends to make pictures quite a bit warmer i would say you need around k correction and some fine tuningexcellent quality tiffen polarizing filter after disassembling and cleaning the dust between lenses
uv filter has good quality and uniformly coated
today it seems that no one has heard that a laminar flow hood should be used to assemble or repair lenses to keep them clean until packagedtiffen filters are good quality and will suffice in most cases
there was a great deal on this twin packthis was a good package of  filters
dont think you can get these  filters for this price in singles
worked well and i am happythey work the way theyre suppose to and they are good quality at a good priceoccasionally useful filters for specialized situations
be sure that each of the three fits your need or select a different kit
tiffen makes good economy grade filterstheres some strong vignetting at mm on a nikon d when using the polarized lens and it only gets worse as you add filtersyou can combine filters together via screwing them togethertried the uv and circular polarizer great shots
have not had an opportunity to use the warm filter need a lovely model to test it onthese lenses were decent for the money that you pay
im a beginner so i dont have anything profound to say about the filters
the polarizer definitely helps remove glare off of water and reflective objects
havent really used the red
i havent had any problems with scratches or threading problems with any of the filters as some other reviews suggestedthis is a nice dealyou get  for a price of onemy set was flawlessthe first set of filters i got one of them had a scratch
amazon as usual was amazing in quickly sending me a replacement even before i returnd the damaged onesthese glasses are fairly scratch friendly so if you are buying these to keep your lens safe be ready to buy them more oftenthis filter set was a great deal
the polarizer helps on  sunny days
the uv filter is a necessity for any serious photographer with a nice camera the  is nice for low light conditionsthe price is the best thing as this is a really good deal for  essential filtersfilters were just as expected
high enough quality optics for the price one of the better deals for consumers looking to enjoy the range of photos they can give yougreat value
just try to find something comparable without spending a ton more cashset arrived before amazon said it would
and it is peak xmas shopping time now
amazon is greatonly complaint is that two of the filters had finger prints on them 
but at least that meant someone had done qc at tiffen before shipping them out
easy to cleanthe case they come in is worth half the price
i store the retaining ring from my canon s in the case when i have the extension tube on with the filter
the  warming filter is also great for overcast rainy days
for the price you cant really do betteroh and the polarizer filter did work fine when i checked it against my computer monitor
thanks to the person that suggested how to check it
pictures of my koi are now possiblethis is a perfect essentials filter kit for the beginner
these filters are must haves for all of your lensesi needed a polarizer for the mm canon pancake so i figure getting the  filters and the pouch would be a great deal
it turned out that the filter works very well does not add any distortion to the pictures as well as the movies
it is worth the money and i would recommend it to anyonegood value very useful for anyone with a good camerai would recommend this product to anyone because it is a good price and basic itemfilters are well made evenly coated etc
i knock them a star for including an uv filter which is just an extra piece of glass as far as a modern digital camera is concerned
if theyd have called it a lens protector id give them the star backi wondered how these wuld work on a dslr as they were standard equipment on my slr
new lens size meant new filter size
i would definitely recommend these to any avid digital photographerwell these filters do what they are supposed to
they are the standard set
there is nothing exceptional or disapointing about thema great set at convenient price
i guess a more expensive product is better but is good to start experimenting with these ones they come into a folder that protect the lenses
the polarizing is good and the warming is sutilthe three filters that come in the kit are a very useful combo
i normally would buy these individually but when i can get all three for not much more than buying one in many stores i had to jump at the dealive been in photography for years from novice to professional and have used tiffen filters most of the time
they are good quality and if i should  damage one oh well
better it than my lensi am very happy with this set of filters
the price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite camera and filtersthe filters do the job as advertised protects the front glass element of the lens
being uncoated filters there was a slight amount of ghosting but nothing serious
i like the pouch too as it provides more than adequite protection
also there are slots for two additional filtershonestly i dont have any particular reason to say that these are bad in any way but theres nothing great or exciting about them and i dont notice any difference with my pictures so i guess all i can say is these are pretty good
give em a trypros  filters together at very affordable price can be threaded on the d lens filters can be threaded over one another
polarizer on the uv filer carry case included in the price
good for handling the filters without risk of scratching improves image quality a lot depending on the type of filter guide book supplied is also useful to decide which filters to use in what situationcons none so faryes  there are better and higher quality items out there but for the average amateur these will do just fine
dont let a camera snob tell you otherwise
unless you are making a living as a photographer these will do quite welli have had these filters for a few months now
i use it with my canon powershot sxis
i think the glass quality is good not the best but it is pretty good
the warm filter works fine theres not too much to mess up in that area
i didnt really find the uv filter to be very useful
i keep it attached to my camera to protect the lens but it doesnt really block uv light very effectively in my opinion
the polarizer is okay but its not a very powerful polarizer so it just barely does its job
at the time i bought these filters i didnt have to much money to spend so for the value they were very good considering what get pay for is what you get with photographic equipment
overall im happy with my purchase because these filters do fulfill my purposes
however if you are looking for top quality filters for your top quality lens for professional use then there really isnt anyway around spending more money because while these filters are pretty good they are probably not the quality you are looking forthe tiffen line of filters appear to be adequate for most circumstances where a filter may be used
most of the time i keep a filter on the lens for lens protection while at other times such as neutral density and polarizing filters they are needed for specific functionality
most of the tiffen line seem to work well for methe pak was excellent
it was very reasonable in cost and although not the fanciest filters you can buy are good quality and very reasonableim not a pro but do some commercial work on the side
these filters have worked well without producing any detectable distortion
i can recommend this seti was concerned about the quality of these filters since the reviews here are kind of a mixed bagbut i decided to take a leap of faith and im glad i didi bought this kit just for the cpl as i already have a hoya uv attached to my lens and in the digital realm i think that this warming filter is close to uselessso i was searching for a decently priced cpl and found this
since the reviews for the hoya cpl the basic one not the moose are also mixed i decided to give it a try since theyre on the same price rangei own a canon eos rebel ti d with the canon efs mm f is stm
im not a pro but im not a complete amateur either so i do use it for freelance jobs as well as personal projectsits my first camera and i think these lenses are for my needs a great startup kit lenses
theyre not the best out there but they will do the job for both photography and video until i start investing on more expensive lensesthat said i didnt want to spend a lot on some prolevel filters as i think the costbenefit right now would be subpar
i ordered the mm one and it was sold and shipped straight from amazonthe cpl works fine
i dont know how it fares against more expensive prolevel ones but for what i expected it to do and for what it actually delivers im satisfied
i saw a lot of people complaining about poor build quality andor quality control but mine is fine works fine and hasnt broken yetthe uv im saving to use in conjunction with my hoya uv to achieve artistic bokeh
my idea is to cut black cardboard circles with the shapes and sandwich them with both uv
i thought of that alone but then read a few people doing that so i think it might work just fineas for the warming one as i said im keeping because it could be useful someday but for now its almost useless  but i had that in mind before i ordered iti also saw some people complaining their kits looked like they had been previously used or were actually products that someone else returned
mine looked like they were brand new  and if theyre not i appreciate the effort to make them look and smell like newthe pouch is a nice touch  not too shabby but does the job
if youre using a well constructed backpackbagcase built for camera i think the pouch can protect the filters well depending on how you store them
if not i think its a nice idea to get something better padded or even made of hard material to store themi only gave it  stars because i cant comment right now on their durability since ive owned and used them for no more than  weeksoverall if youre on a tight budget but want to try new things id recommend it
i think its a mater of luck if youll get a working one or not so if youre willing to gamble go forththese are good quality filters
they could have been in a carrier of some type though to make them easier to protedti usually buy a set of filters for each size lens i have
tiffen has always provided great value
these are no exception
i would recommend these to everyonethese are nice basic filters and are well made
the polarizer works great and i leave the uv filter on my camera all the time
i havent tried the warm filter yet but if its as good as the others im happy
please note that these filters are not multicoated
they are very high quality optical glass and are actually two pieces of glass sandwiched
they are optically distortion free and are easy to clean
the frames are aluminium powder coated and the wheel for the polarizer is plastic
the polarizer can be a bit tricky to take off if its too tight on the camera because the wheel is the same diameter as the filterand this is done because some removable lens caps are the the cupped versionand the camera lens cap might not stay on unless the polarizer wheel is the diameter as the lens
its no biggieits still fairly easy to remove the polarizer
many photo shops approve of these filters because they do a good job even though they are not multicoated
multicoated filters are harder to clean and you risk removing the coating when cleaning
just use a lens hood if your worried about lens flare and these filters will do a good job
tiffen does make multicoated filters in military grade high defbut they are very pricey for us amaturesfilters perform as expected
nice pouch is provided to protect the filters when not on the camera
used on the canon s is while i was on vacation
use the uv filter to protect the camera lens
noticed no degradation or distortionthree essential filters for an essential lens mm
every photographer should have one and this set of filters is not only required but at this price is more than a bargain
i felt guilty purchasing it
the only reason for four stars and not five is that the pouch can hold more than three lenses
they should have filled it and even with a little higher price this item would still have been a bargaini use these on my nikkor mm and they are well constructed with no defect
the filters achieve the desired results but these arent high quality multicoated or extra thin lens for better light emissionoverall im happy with the purchase
they were fairly economical for what i neededthis is a great set of filters
i only gave it  stars because the filters do not have protection in the container they come in
i would have thought they would each be in a plastic bag inside the container but they were not
other than that the filters are great
tiffen makes great filtersheres a decent set of filters and certainly satisfactory for a cheapskate like me
the filters fit on my panasonic lenses smoothly though an extra thread or so might make installation easier
after extensive testing i noted differences between photos taken with and without the filters on the camera especially pictures of blue skies with clouds
the polarizer turns smoothly but turning it to different positions made little difference in the looks of the scenesthe uv protector is good for taking pictures through glass and stays on my camera all the time to protect the lensa nice case for lens storage is included with purchase it holds four filtersi bought these filters as much for protecting my lens as for the filter effect and they work as advertizedthis kit comes with four things circular polarizer the filter that most people looking at this kit are interested in
while it is difficult to make a bad polarizer it either works or doesnt this one certainly is among the good working ones
makes the sky look awesome and takes away reflections from water and windows
polarizer is a definite must for photographers of any level uv filter if you read reviews online the tiffen uv filter is generally not effective at blocking out uv
so most people just use it as an additional layer of glass for protecting their lens
my personal philosophy is why bother but you may find it interesting warming filter this is really more for the authentic field photographer who wants their picture to look right the first time
any decent software can mimic this effect so i also say why bother a fourfilter pouch there is a single pouch to store all three filters
since polarizer is a little thicker in effect its just perfect for three
since there no individual wrappers and i only really use one filter this pouch just sits at homeoverall for a bit more than what the polarizer is retailing alone you get some extras
i dont really find their all that valuable but nevertheless worth the extra couple of dollarsregarding the build quality i am not discerning enough to tell any aberrations in the glass
the plastic frame though is a bit rough along the edges and the printed labels arent sharp but doesnt really affect the performance
but basically it doesnt look expensive
made in usaalso comes with a promotional brochure but its interesting cause it explains the effects of all current tiffen filters so good reading material im an amateur getting into photography and this product was great for my purposes
the only filter that has been somewhat of a problem to get used to has been the polarizer
it has on  occasions really distorted the light on my composure
it may be something im doing wrong but it has only happened with the polarizer
i dont really use the uv protector and the  warmer filter is really useless given that you can just increase the temp on any photo editing software to achieve the same effect
the neutral density filter works great though my dad tells me there are better ones available
overall for the price it seems that youre getting a great deal
its a great buy for beginnersnonhardcore photographersi am surprised with the result
the photos are with an excellent appearance
excellent result
the light of the flash always leaves the object photographed clearly cace with white spot
with the filters this does not happen
it seems to be a photo in high definitionthis is a great starter set for those looking for some filters but not looking to spend too much
the set comes in a nice soft case that has four pouches for filters
they work just fine with all of my nikon lenses
i may have been expecting them to have a greater effect on my pictures and i dont use them too often
if you are a professional i would look to highend filters but for everyone else this is a good place to startnot comparable to ektar or the portras
if the light is off or low not so good
rather lowcontrast and unsaturated
however when scanned and manipulated digitally i use lr the results can be quite beautiful
very nondigital sometimes lots of grain
nobody seems to have developed a digital emulation of this snapshot retro look
the palette is sort of martin parr or william eggleston
absurdly inexpensive
does not convert to bw very well
actually i kind of prefer it to portra  which seems plasticish
curious to see what happens if its pushed
will try it sooni have been using this grip on my d for about a month and absolutely love it
the grip itself is sturdy and comfortable and with the wrist strap is attached there is no concern of losing control of the cameraone of the earlier reviewers mentions that this is hard to put on and take off quickly but this isnt a fault of the grip so much as picking the right tool for the job
if you take up and put down your camera every few minutes then yes get a standard grip
if youre shooting for extended periods moving through crowds or find yourself regularly looping your neck strap around your wrist for stability this is the grip you want
im willing to spend five seconds securing the wrist strap so that i can shoot comfortably for half an hour or more
its also entirely possible to simply use it as a hand strap and let the wrist portion hang free for quick shotsthe only downsides i have found to this grip is that it does effectively tie your hand to the camera so scrambling over rocks and shaking hands becomes more complicated
also a moisturewicking liner would be useful when shooting for extended periods in warm environmentsso the short answer if you need a simple solid method for keeping your camera secure and ready to shoot this is a fantastic optionwhen im actively shootingas compared to walking around with my camera at the readythen ive grown to prefer this grip over a neck strap
basically this is a strap that helps keep the camera from slipping out of ones hand
the reason i give it four rather than five stars is that in order to keep the camera secure the grip needs to be adjusted to eliminate too much slack that would risk an accidental slip
but that amount of tightness can make it more difficult to make adjustments to the camera settings
i think thats a tradeoff that is inherent in this type of device rather than this particular product
i own two one for each of my camerasthis camera grip is a nice product and is very useful on my d although it fits a bit different than i expected
in order to operate the camera properly i need to loosen the strap a bit and thus bringing the bulk of my palm off of the camera grip
this means youre not really gripping the camera anymore as much as youre wedging your knuckles into the strap to brace your camerathis sounds strange and my explanation is awkward but when i cinched up the  strap taut right away as i thought intuitive i immediately learned that my command of all the features operated by my right hand was greatly mitigated
i have slightly largerthanaverage hands so that is a small part of the issue but loosening the strap and making a kindof cup with my right hand restores the utility of my hand on the camera and still feels very solidthe only thing i dont like about this is that the buckle loosens fairly frequently
granted it takes only about a second to retighten it but it is still slightly annoying tending to it consistentlyi havent tried this on any other slr but based on my experience i would think that it would be less useful and more annoying based on body size on something like a d d d or any of the eos rebels
on anything like a d d or any fullframe camera body i recommend iti bought this lens when the kit lens that came with my xti got broken
i was hoping this lens would be a replacement for the similar canon one
however once i started using the tamron i quickly realized that it is noticeably slower in focusing than the canon
it also seems i have to be zoomed out farther or physically farther from the subject to get a good focus  and sometimes it just searches and never obtains focus
while the canon lens was not perfect i think it was a little better than this one
one great thing about tamron lenses is that most of them come with a hood which is great when bonus is keeping out stray light
this lens is adequate for many shooting situations and makes a great walkaround lens for most folks but its not without its drawbacksi am a volunteer photographer at an animal shelter and needed a decent inexpensive and lightweight lens to use in place of my canon is lens that was pricier and heavier
the mm lens kit that came with my rebel xt was not cutting it and i needed more zoom
i had the sigma mm lens but the barrel creep was becoming a nuisance although the pictures came out good
so after reading the reviews i got this lens
the price cannot be beat and the zoom range is perfect for what i need
i have had to shoot in the shade low and harsh lighting and it has performed well for its class
i now have the d with this lens and the photos look better than the rebels
if you are looking for a decent workhorse lens this is worth looking into
i plan on purchasing another is lens but will keep this tamron for my rougher work environmentstamron  lens is a reasonable lens for the pricei noticed that pictures are a little soft at  mm range but they are crisp and sharp at the lower ranges of focusstill unbeatable price for the quality that this producesthanks tamronnice cheap lens
one of those allaround everyday lenses for the beginner or a backup for everyone who got to be ready for sudden occasions
ahaa and by much a lot better than the kit lens which comes with the canon xti
it could have been better constructed but light and capable of taking decent images that will surprise even the best professionalsi purchased this lens with my mm rebel k
a the time of this review i have shot  rolls of bw film though it of landscape and some action shots of peoplethe lens has preformed admirably thus far
i have used it in both manual and auto focus modes both have resulted in good sharp photos
the included lens hood does a good job of preventing glare on the lens and the lens cap included with the lens can be removed with the hood on the lensthe way the wide angle zoom feature works seems odd in order to get this lens to act similar to a prime lens it makes some sense the lens is at its shortest length a mm then lengthens when either going to mm or mm
holding the camera and lens properly will prevent you from accidentally interfering with the focus ring in the auto focus mode
i prefer manual focus old habits die hard however when in auto focus the lens works well to quickly focus and allow the camera to shootthis isnt a fast lens as far as maximum aperture is concerned but for the average user it will work well in most normal lighting situationsif you are doing photography in lower light this lens may not work for youover all the lese is good for a good price for about  this is a good lens for the average nonprofessional beginner  intermediate photographerthis is a very good and cheap multipurpose lens
it is the lens i tend to use most of the time for general photography
the x factor of my nikon d makes the lower end rise to mm but that is not the lens fault
the only negatives i have is that the af is a bit slow and since it is a conventional lens light effects can be noticeable in bright lighti bought this tamron lens for a nikon d
i cant really judge this lens too much because my i have not tried too many nikon or nikon based lenses
i needed something on a budget
i read some reviews on different lens and it came to trying this one
its a good lens for the price
i mean cmon its not even sixty dollars
i havent found the sweet spot but so far f has been giving me good results
im not happy with the results f and below
focal  seems blurrier than f most of the time
i dont know if its the lens or just my lack of skills that is causing it
probably my lack of skills
overall if you need something cheap and simple to carry around this will do okthis was the first lens i bought after getting my kd
i wanted something beyond the mm from my kit lens but didnt have a lot of money to spend
at  it was hard to pass this up
keep the price in mind when looking at this lensfor  you get a good lens for indoor and outdoor shooting of people and stuff
when i am shooting people in candid situations i find the mm range gives me what i need to get the groups and zoom in to get expresions
its a nice middle
the image quality is not the best but again for less than dinner for two with drinks it is more than acceptablethis is a fat but light lens
lots of plastic but still seems well built
i dont think it will take any more or less abuse than any other lens out there
then again for  if it gets destroyed its not such a big deal
in fact it has become my danger lens  if there is a chance i might damage something i use this onethe image quality is good  not great  but good
it is a little soft at mm and wide open
it shoots a little dark and a little warm but nothing that is too hard to adjust in post processing
again this is a budget lens so dont expect too much
the minimum focus distance is not close  closer to  feet than   meter  which limits the zoom a little
for people shooting its not a big deal because no one wants a lens stuck in their facei am very happy with this lens and i would recommend it to anyone on a tight budget
but even if you dont have a tight budget if it is the right lens  times a year its a bargainthe tamron af mm lens for pentax slr cameras is an inexpensive way to increase the zoom on you camera
it provides a very useful zoom range for general photography and relatively sharp picturesfor the price this is an excellent lens but did a side by side comparison with my higher priced tamron  mm and there is a clear difference in sharpness and contrast so dont expect perfection
if youre extremely demanding then spend the money on quality glass but if youre a casual shooter and want to save some  this is a good deal and great for every day photography
see samples in galleryi own a sony dslra
i bought this tamron lens at the recommendation of some other sony dslr owners on the forums at steves digicams
at the time one vendor had them for 
i could not pass this up especially after seeing the sample shots posted by users
i was not disappointed
the clarity of my photos is great and the colors look clear and bright
thought it is not a macro lens minimum focus is something like  i have taken many clear closeup shots with it
it is a film lens but works flawlessly with the sony alpha cameras
tamron makes decent lensesif you are an outdoor photographer this filter is a must for your collection
the gradual grey allows you to get the correct exposure for the sky and land
for example if you are shooting a sunset or sunrise it is easy to correctly expose the sky living the bottom part of your picture underexposed and almost black
this filter will help in these situations by giving both parts of your picture the proper exposurethe filter itself comes in a protective plastic case that is well secured
you could throw it in your camera bag and not worry about it accidentally openingfyi  this filter is part of the cokin p series which are a bit bigger than their a series and designed for wider angle lenses
if you arent sure what size lens you are going to be using the filter with it is probably a good idea to be safe and go with the p series
in any case there is plenty of information on cokin filters to be found around the web
one summary can be found at this is a great product the plexi glass is high quality and certainly does its job as a graduated nd filtermy only gripe is that i wish it came in a better case with it moving around and not being held firmly in place it will end up with worn down edges and a scratched up nd filter
there are others out there with better cases but for the price this does its job
i ended up just replacing my case with a better one later oni really like the cokin filter system
with ring adapters a single investment can be leveraged to multiple lens andor cameras
good quality and reasonable pricingthis was my first nd graduated filter
it works nicely
my two complaints are the its plexiglass which will scratch over time and that the edges arent rounded off
i like most people will be hand holding this when using it
these are made to be used with a holder but  cokin knows people hand hold these most of the time so why not round the edges off a bit
overall i am happy with it thoughlike the price doesnt seem to shift color wish the case came with a liner the filter is very fragile but take care of it and you should be fine
drop it and it will scratch or breakalready had the holder so just got an adapter to fit threads of my other lensbought specifically for slowing waters with a long exposuredoes get scatched if not careful and the carrying case is too fragileuntil i get  for glass one this will do job of stilling running water quite nicelyfor me this has been a great little machine
it has everything i need including pocket access which you cant get anymore
with a keyboard that works well once you get used to it a modem a windows platform this little pc keeps me functioning while on the road much better than a pda  this is a computerthe hp jornada  the final model of this line was the  is the finest practical design mobile handheld computing device ever made
the jornada rival is the nec mobilepro  line
both clamshell minilaptop looking devices were high quality and expensive average retail was over these devices are authentic handhelds and they are true mobile pcs
in comparison pdas are very expensive toys
both necs  jornadas have practical data input technology a truly useable keyboard  a touch screen
both jornadas and necs have builtin card slots
being pda type devices handhelds have no moving parts  they are instant on  off
they come with builtin phone modems  infrared wireless ports
neither line the jornada or nec was designed for modern radio type wireless internet but both lines are fully capable of itby the way the chief reasons laptops break down are all related to their being moved about
damaged screens from being dropped or handled roughly  hard drive failure are the major problems
own a  and like me you will soon consider a laptop the lugabout portable desktop computer it is
make a home made insulator envelope of bubble wrap envelope for your jornada or nec and they should be ok
to take with you
a discount cd wallet can be easily found and adapted to serve as an inexpensive case
i carry my jornadas and necs in a hipsack
there is no hard drive to fail from chuck hole caused rough movement in a car or from droppingdont let the apparent memory limitations throw you off
your basic productivity programs are permanently hardware loaded in rom  many mobile windows ce programs can be installed and run from cf cards and both jornada  nec lines can handle up to one gig or bigger cf cards
some enthusiasts report success runing cf micro drives
there are also inexpensive cf card slot adapters that allow considerable additional adaptabilitysome of the software that comes with these devices is severely outdated especially the microsoft syncing software microsoft activesync
no problem
the best version is activesync  anyway and it is freely available
download and install it to your xp system and youll have no problem syncing with a jornada or necthese handhelds were never meant for the general consumer market
they are enterprise devices which is why few consumers know about them
had hp  nec marketing included the handhelds i think most college students would sport one today instead of the lugaboutsi own a jornada e under  likenew refurbished a  i also own a nec mobilepro    the last real handheld pc the nec c
my favorite is the nec   c line because necs have a larger keyboard than jornadas do
i have big hands but i am able to twofinger touch type with the  jornada models   
i can two hand touch type with an nec mobile proamong handheld enthusiasts the jornada  and  are the clear favorites
while both jornadas and necs are high quality engineering and make the jornada is the best provided you can get along with the keyboard
people with large hands will like the nec case  keyboard better
the    has external voice record and playback buttons and they have a stereo headphone jackget this both handheld lines get  or more hours active use time per battery charge and they weigh less than  pounds including the liion battery
the jornadas are more energy efficient so you can be a little more sloppy about leaving a cf or wireless card plug in the off state
the necs need to be plugged in if you leave cards plug in
no problem
i simply make sure my cards are disconnected when i am not using themi do about everything with a computer that computers are used for
when i leave my house i never take a laptop
i always take either my nec  or nec  i connect with public access points automatically without any problem
i like the jornada  better but i can type much easier and faster on the larger necthere are a lot of things you can do to update a jornada or an nec and there is a very active quality user support group whose members will help you as you have never before received information and assistance for a computer
the site
hpcfactorcom registration is easy and free and the site is a storehouse of free software and drivers for handheld computersthe site again for everything handheld is hpcfactorcomi give the jornada  stars because i consider the sharp zaurus sl  the best handheld made
they are sharp linux devices are not sold in usa are cheaper than current hp and dell pda toys
the zaurus line is king in japan and asia as they come installed with a sharp version of linux
the big downside is size
while the screen and keyboard is too small for most westerners they work fine for most asian peoplei bought this lens for the canon mount
the seller listed it under the nikon mount because there is no listing on amazon for the canon version
but amazon combines all the reviews together anyway so i will write my review hereive had a full day to test the lens and even used it at a photo shoot last evening
there are so many things about this lens that i love ultra wide angle
this is the widest rectilinear prime focal length made
canon has one of course and the mark ii version costs over 
i picked my sigma up used here on amazon for only  i consider it a great deal since this lens is becoming rare
close focusing range
it focuses closer than the expensive canon l lens
this lens focuses so close just  inches from the focal plane
this is actually a macro lens
i already took some really cool shots at the close distance
sharpness
soft wide open but sharpens up nicely at f
at the center of the frame this lens is sharper at f than mycanon efs mm f is usm ud wide angle zoom lens for canon digital slr cameraslens is at f  mm
and i always considered that a sharp lens
flexibility
on my fullframe canon d mark ii this gives an ultrawide field of view of  degrees
fun but perhaps too wide for many uses
if youre not careful your subject gets lost
but on my d it gives a very useful field of view equivalent to mm while utilizing the sharpest part of the image
autofocus
works like a champ is fast and dead on
not like my experience with some other sigma lenses that i had to send in for calibration
focuses well in low light too
built like a tank
solid
im used to using telephoto lenses so to me it doesnt seem heavy at allthere is really only one thing i dont like about this lens and that is the poor performance in the corners
the distortion and vignetting can be corrected in software but the corners are smeared so badly wide open and never fully clear up even when stopped down
the center reaches optimal sharpness at f and the corners do sharpen up somewhat reaching optimal sharpness at f
but even at f the smearing is still there and its not just the far corners its a fair amount of the outer edge that is smeared looking
in small photos for the web its not really apparent and if your background is out of focus it wont matter but if youre a professional landscape photographer this may be an issuethe good news is that if youre using this lens on an apsc camera to get a mm equivalent focal length your cameras sensor crops out the offending edges
you only capture the center sweet spot of the image and although you can still tell that the far left and right sides of the image are not as sharp as the center its not bad at all
still i cant give  stars to a lens that is not acceptably sharp from corner to cornerso why did sigma discontinue this lens in 
by all counts it was a popular lower cost alternative to the canon l glass with even better image quality than the first canon version
perhaps there is a revision in the works
lets hope so
sigma has been coming out with some great lenses latelythe sigma mm f is a great lens
it does a good job of keeping line straight
as others have stated you need to stop down  or higher to keep sharp focus
thats the case with most very wide angle lenses
it is difficult to focus as others as said
thats just the nature of very wide angle lenses
if you shooting something up close then let the autofocus do it for you
it you want to make certain its in focus then measure the old fashioned way
ive shot numerous projects with this lens and find to be major player in the very wide angle lens field
ive shot home exteriors home interiors art gallery interiors and even food with this lensmy only issue with this lens is that it does not handle blowout hot spots well
it tends to shift the color on the fringes of the hot spot to the yellow
you just need to be careful not blowout hot spots which why i gave  stars instead of  starsthis is for a canon mount
all the other reviews pretty much sum up this lens
on apsc it crops out the ugliness of the smeared corners
i cant get a sharp pic in any corner at any aperture on ff
on apsc its a different story
just use f for everything and you will be ok the ff vignettes and smeears the corners pretty badly
the mm fl lens is over 
big difference but if you have ff i am sure the l lens will be better as it cant be worseive had this product a month and was very pleased with it
we had recorded about  minutes of video part of which my wife had viewed once successfully
we then went to watch the whole tape again and found that there were thick grey horizontal lines across the picture in playback mode
based on the manual we used a cleaning tape which resolved the problem although after a further    minutes of viewing the problem reoccurred
a further cleaning again resolved the issue
i dont know if the heads were dirty when we got the camera or if the issue was the brand new tdk tapes we were using
we have bought some panasonic tapes now which we will use for a week of two before deciding whether there is something more seriously wrong with the camera that needs to be checked out under warrantychanged my mind
this one is a disaster
linksys far better
i now would rate this one a onestarnow that i have this product up and running i have to say it works great
however this is not one of those quotworks right out of the boxquot products if you are a first timer
setup is not intuitive in my opinion and the quick start guide and manual give conflicting instructions
as a matter of fact i was going to send it back when i went onto this forum and discovered that you have to fire up your browser to complete the installation
once that dawned on me it took about  minutes to network  computers
it handles  teen age daughters downloading mps at the same time with no sweat
i would recommend this product with no hesitation provided you are patient enough to work through some lousy documentationi am th year computer science major at berkeley and i bought this product back when it was having a huge rebate  i bought it to split a dsl connection among me and  other roomates
my friends also bought it too for the rebate
its a pretty solid working gateway but it will once in awhile kill your connection
it happened to both me and my friends who bought it and after we simply turned in on and off things were good to go again of course this might have to do with other problems but im pretty certain its the gatewaythe configuration is pretty straightforward though if youre not sure what youre doing not tech savy it might be difficult to wade through
it gives you a host of options and the company has even updated the firmware
as for the firewall it blocks out all besides the standard ports pretty well
so well in fact that some applications such as sending through aim fail to work unless configured correctly
i think people without enough computer knowledge might find this annoyingalso a tip for cable modem users i had to search through the companies faq online to figure out how to make it work with att modems
i hope by now theyve included this in the manual
overall its a good product but a better faq or manual would help make it easier ot usei know some of you have read bad reviews on thisproduct
what makes it bad is there are no real instructionsfor installing it
i bought one defectivegot another works very well
i had read one of these reviews
when you get this productthere is one booklet that says helpprinted in  languages
call the number where it saysquotunder  day warrantyquotwhen you first get the burner
hp were great
they spent almost two hours with megetting everything doneincluding getting the quotkinksquot out of my computer
i did have to download a new version of hp record now but everything fell into placeand get this product from amazonthey were very good about thedelivery and their warranty
give this burner another trydont use it as you favorite beverage coasteri like many others agree that the basic instructions could have been written better
the software installed fine
i just couldnt get the thing to burn
called hp and they took me through several extensive computer adjustments starting inmy computer iedevice manager cdrom property settings then back to to my computer property performance file system hard disc cdrom graphicsall had some adjustments
we also went into control panel clicked on display and reset the screen saver not to come on for at least  minutesor better yet turn it off to burn music cds then we went into the rewritter program and went to options
reduced the speed to x or x at the most and unchecked the test operations before recording disc
we also went into explorer tools internet options and selected the delete files and also checked the delete all offline content
we also turned off our connection to the internetwe then proceeded to burn a cd and it workednotethe above only relate to burning music cds
these seem to be the fussiest
i had no problem burning all the photo cds at x even being connected to the internetalso and this is important
i found out that at least with my computer  a gateway desktop pent ii mhz windows  that i can not burn a cd if there is any other usb device attached to the back of my tower 
i have  usp ports
one for the cd burner and the other for my printer
i have to unplug my hp  printer from its usb port in order for the hp cdwritter to burn a music cd
dont ask me why
even hp cant answer that one for me
and forget about using a usb extension hub to plug in the burneryou will just waste discslike i said once i got the kinks worked out the unit burns like a dream i did find the people at hp very very nice and helpful
without them i would have given up
my neighbor has one and never had the problems i hadhis installed immediately and worked without all the tweaks
his computer is newer and he was also running windows me for an inexpensive unit it fits my needs at the momenti have windows  and i was reading some of the bad experiences of people using the gametheaterxp under wini have installed it twice under windows  once after removing my old sound card sblive and once with a clean system
i had no problems installing the drivers under windows  someone said that it was detected as a crystalfusion or something
read the instructions that are included in the box
most times you are supposed to hit cancel and not let windows install any drivers for new hardware that you buy
if you clicked ok and let it install conflicting drivers then you didnt read the simple installation instructionsanother person said that for some reason his speaker setup was changed from  to speaker stereo each time he played a gamei use the speaker setup and i have never seen it change on its ownspeaker sound works good in games under windows when eax is enabled like in diablo the sound seems distant and soft and i have to turn the volume up generally
that only seems to happen in some games
most games the sound volume is fine even with eax enabledthis sound card is far superior to even the sb live for sound quality
cranking the volume level on my cambridge soundworks spkr setup all the way up yields a barely audible background hiss
most sound cards have pretty bad background hiss as you turn up the volume and i found this sound card to be the besteax is not as good as the sb live but i doubt any sound card can do that perfectlyi play a lot of games new and old and i have not seen it crash under windows  i am using the latest  drivers for itoverall its a good card but i am looking for something new that has better windows  compatibilitythe hercules maxi sound game theatre xp is a great deal for gamers movie buffs and music fanatics
i plugged mine in to my optical port on my reciever with  surround sound and everything works great
only problem is it doesnt work on windows  x but does work with windows  x
not a big deal just a quick reintsall of your os and your all set
if you have an x os your all set anywayi have been into digital photography for about  years and have owned an apple quicktake  lame nikon coolpix  decent nikon coolpix  almost right read my review and now the g
i have it set up with the  mb ibm microdrive as well as the canon ex speelite
this combination i feel is about as good as you can get without getting to the price range canon d
here are some things you may not see in the other reviews the camera once it powers on after about  seconds is very very quick shooting
you almost cant want to shoot faster than it will allow
 focus can however slow you down a bit especially in dark setting despite focusassist light and in lowcontrast settings
i am a dentist couldnt you tell by the name
 and the camera does have issues with intraoral focusing
 playback of images is very fast especially when you use the raw format
you can flip through about second
if you can buy a big memory card
i have the  mb microdrive and can store about  images in raw mode
this mode is important
it is the equivalent of a tiff file but only takes about  megsimage instead of  megs with the coolpix  also shottoshot in tiff mode on the  is almost  seconds on the g shottoshot in raw is about  second
also in raw mode you can alter brightnesscontrastcolor saturation losslessly
 flash photography is a complete joy to do with this camera
the ex is a spectacular flash there is tons of power no red eye and the ettl system makes even bounce and swivel photography a complete breeze
you can even overunderexpose the flash and wirelessly control multiple flashes
just totally unparalleled
nikon and olympus just cant touch this
 doesnt even have a hot shoe the battery is on steroids just never wants to run out realistically  shots til reload
with the coolpix  you have to buy batteries and a charger
koodos to canon for adding this value to the g
 the layout of the controls is such that just about every button is within easy reach of my fingers
excellent
optional adapter  ladc screws into the front and allows you to use standard  mm lenses and ring lights to further expand your creativity
 camera is fairly hefty and builty like a tank
this sure isnt going to break in your hands setting the iso to  nikon cant do this gives just absolutely fantastic photos with very minimal noise even in the dead of night nikon had much more noisenegative stuff hey it cant be perfect
 there is no program shift
how could they do this
this actually is a bummer and the standard program mode always seems to favor wide open fstops stick to aperturepriority
 has this you cannot have multiple folders to store images to
this is a pain since i can store about  images between downloads and i never want to have my patient photos mixed up
 has this feature but i consider it a minor inconveniencein conclusion the unique highs of this camera include the image quality iso  awesome flash capabilities ibm microdrive support raw image mode great battery and lots of great accessories
the negatives include suspect nightlow contrast focusing and no program  shift
ive used most  megapixel cameras and i think this is the gem of the loti use this lens with the canon ais
it turns out this is a pretty generic closeup lens not specific to the canon compact digicams it is compatible with a lot of lenses
it works fine with the full x zoom on this camera  mm equivalentwith natural lighting this lens gives great results
at closest focus with max zoom about  inches the field of view is about  inches across compared to around  inches across at same distance without the lens where youd have to use x or with x zoom youd get about  inches across at closest focus about  inches away
the result can be stunning detail of small critters
i take a lot of smallcritter closeups and i find this lens most useful for the skittish ones spiders flies butterflies
but if the subject will hold still for you you can do better without this lens using x no zoom with a field of view about  inch across at about  inch from the subject but at that distance you often have a problem with the lens casting a shadow over the subject
bottom line  if you have the canon ais or similar camera this lens makes a huge difference and is well worth the money especially with the ais where closeup ability is the greatest weaknessi use this lens only with maximum zoom setting
if you go down to x  mm equiv
this camera lets you go into macro mode but it gives a field of view about  inches across at  inch from the subject
not gooda word of caution
after blowing a bunch of photos using this lens i figured out that even if the camera shows you a green ok focused signal it will still be blurry unless you hold the camera between about  and  inches from the subject
so in practice you will want to take several shots at different distances to make sure you get within the zone where focus is sharp
also it is very hard to see if you have the right parts of the critter in focus so throw in a few extra shots for that too
but it is all worth it to get a couple of sharp closeups
one thing that helps is the relatively speedy focus of this camera so you can take the shot before your hand sways out of the plane of focusthere is no vignetting whatsoever with this lens at any zoom setting unlike the x teleconverter
however a rather significant drawback is the shadowing the adapter causes in flash photos
it is not a sharpedged shadow in fact it creates more of a linear gradient darkest at lower right and brightest at top left
happily many closeups will be of tiny subjects anyway that still occupy only a small portion of the image so once you crop the image the shadowing gradient is pretty subtle
i got several excellent photos of this kind already
however when you want to keep the whole image eg
a closeup of lichens over a rock the shadowing will ruin the photo unless perhaps used as an added subtle fillflash
this is a shame because with a working distance of  inches provided by this lens you could imagine some really great flash photography otherwise
normally the problem with flash with pointandshoot closeups is it is too bright
the most convenient way to use this lens will be keeping it threaded onto the adapter already you can then pop the whole thing on and off the camera very quickly
unfortunately only a standard filterbox is provided with this lens so youd need to find a larger container to hold it together with the adapterincidentally if you try carefully loosely
so the lenses dont touch combining this lens with the x teleconverter for the ais the results are  field of view about  inches across at  inches distance farthest or  inches across at  inches distance closest focus
probably not worth doingone nice feature of this closeup lens is it has  mm threads on both sides so you can add a polarizing or other filter on top
in fact once you have the  adapter that is required for this lens for ais you can add mm filters for everyday use even when not using addon lenses  that was a nice surprisei use this product for the canon gthe quality of the photos i have taken are great and im really happy with the pics
huge resolutions a good printer and a decent overall effecti would say though that for  bucks you should get this only if you plan to use it ie flower closeups wilderness photos of small items etci bought this close up lens to use with my canon ti and kit lenses
ive only had it a few days
first impressions are good but its going to take some practice to learn to use
the build is good nice and heavy compared to a standard filter
so far ive discoverd that its easier to manual focus then physically move the camera forward and back to get the clearest photo instead of trying to auto focus
now that may change in different light and situationsim glad that i bought this well in advance of my next vacation and flower season
hopefully by then ill have gotten a good feel for working with it
a dedicated macro lens would have probably been simplier but im not ready to spend that much to take photos of flowers which is what i wanted it forthis battery came with my canon g digital camera about  months ago and it was very reliable and gave me a couple of hundred shots on a single charge
i bought two additional ones to quotbe safequot as i was taking a two week cruise of europe and didnt want to be caught short on power this was about a year ago
it was not a problem as i rarely needed more than one battery on a days shootbut i have found that the three batteries are weakening with continued use and charging
i just came back from a vacation in hawaii and was finding that i was going deep into a second battery on most days even though i wasnt taking any more pictures than on my previous trip
i charged up all of my batteries to shoot fireworks for the july th celebration and went through one battery very quickly about  minutes and almost drained a second in another  minutes
i think the constant recharging of the batteries have taken a huge toll on them now and they are on their last legsgiven that these batteries arent cheap i was hoping theyd last another year or two but i think that isnt going to be the case
i think some other reviews are bearing this out as well
but when these batteries are at full strength they are pretty good and reliable
but it looks like that only for a finite amount of time
so if you are getting a canon product that uses these batteries you better have at least two on hand and be prepared to have to replace them at some point in he futurethis battery can last a long time as long as you dont keep the lcd screen on to long and depending on your usage of flash photography
you might want to keep a spare aroundsometimes the charger says the battery has recharged too soon and it is a false reading
never completely sure of the chargeis the d the very best digital camera available no
is it a very good camera for the price yes
i paid about x for a d body with the gb microdriveextra battery as free rebates from canon
 if you figure the rebate was worth about  then i paid about x for the body
the bottom line seems to be the d makes images about as good as typical  mm color film id bet not as good as kodachrome thoughi did find the camera took some getting used to
for example washed out highlights sometimes get color fringes and unprocessed images look flat and quite unsharp
after learning about sharpening and contrast adjustment photoshop unsharp mask ltsearch web for d unsharp mask for details im pretty pleased with the image quality
being able to instantly get a image histogram moments after snapping a picture is a great way to analyze the contrast range of a scene and makes me now think how photography with a film camera was totally lacking in immediate feedback about picture qualitya few features are not so well documented if you read the manual enough times its in there like if you activate mirror lock up the self timer is  seconds instead of  perfect for long tripod exposures
i also didnt immediatly realize how important the dial on the back was needed for white balance selection exposure compensation and manual mode control
speaking of white balance its great to snap a picture of a neutral white surface i use a  grey card and instantly get the camera to adjust the color balance
remember daylight and tungsten filters for filmi suppose you can use fully automatic mode for quick pictures of ufos flying by but think this is a camera more for people who like to adjust things for best qualitythe only reservation i have is resolution being  megapixels
there are now  megapixel cameras but they either cost a lot more like the canon d or else loose a lot of that slrness
like no ttl viewfinder on the sony   and no interchangable lenses on the olympus e at the same price or more as my effectiveprice on the d
i was very surprised to find that everybody rates the number of pixels based on all colors
a  megapixel digital camera has generally  megapixels of green sensors  of read and blue
this means in a  megapixel rgb image  of the final data is made up from interpolation
in my book thats not really  megapixels
some higher end prosumerpro video cameras have three sensors one for each color although these do cost morebased on everything i know now a lot more i would still probably buy the d  i cant think of any alternatives that give so much for the priceif you use larger lenses youll probably want this just to balance the camera properly
and since larger lenses need more power to focus and image stabilization drains the batteries more quickly two batteries can come in handy
most likely youll have power for at least a full day of heavy shooting
unfortunately though the eosd itself can take bp batteries this grip cannot  bpas or similarlyshaped batteries only
it can use different batteries in combination even with different power ratings it will first use the highercharged battery then drain them both equally
i use a power  mahv together with my old bp mahvit comes with a little slot in the side of the shaft that can hold the cameras battery cover which must be removed or an extra cf card
handy
and you get extra control buttons on the grip for taking pictures in a vertical orientation and a switch to disable themthe price is excessive though
if it were priced similarly to the rebels grip id give this five stars easily
at us its a much tougher call  it should still go on your wish lists but at a much lower priority depending on your purposes and equipmentkodak makes the industys best film
period
like the title says the faster the film the better the results for amatures anyway
 is the minimum that any amatuer should buy and generally the results are pretty good
 speed is even better but be prepared to pay more for it
 is good for low light and highspeed subjects
however for most situations  should be finethe film is fine
its asa of  is a good speed for outdoor pics with little motion
an asa of  is however preferable for those whose pictures will be taken mostly indoors
those who want to freeze motion eg
sports will benefit from an asa of  portraiture should be done on slow asa  or lower if available film
value within each speed should be calculated by exposures divided by roll price in general the  exposure size is a better bargain than these si dont know why the quotcomputer techquot from intel couldnt figure this thing out
its really quite simple
perhaps he had a problem with it because intel has their own goofy mp player  hmm
  i set up several folders each with dozens of songs and it was a breeze
i also use mine for moving large files from my laptop to other computers
awesome product and very versitilethis little beauty is almost perfect
just make sure to download the latest firmware because it fixes the soundpros  gb storage i stored  mp music files and  mp audio book files mb average and still had  mb left
 sound after firmware upgrade the sound is excellent better than my phillips expanium cdmp player because i can change the bass and treble settings cant do this on the expanium
 can scroll forward and backwards through mps cant do this on expanium either  id tag support shows the cd track number and song name or the filename if no id tag
 mu playlist support
 upgradeable firmware thank you archos
 doubles as a hard drive drag and drop any file from explorer into archos drive
 rechargeable batteries that last  hours on average
 if you live on the edge you can upgrade the hardrive to mb this will invalidate you warrantycons   playlist chokes on lists of more than  or so songs  shuffle does not quite shuffle correctly  no quotresumequot function  no car kit though it will work with any standard cassette kit i dont know about the power thoughif they fix the playlist and shuffle bugs this unit could be the killerok so im a little mad at the two people to date who said my original review that i spent an afternoon working on wasnt helpful
thats ok though many more people were helped
i did  want to address some of the questions and complaints from some of the other reviews you do not need the included musicmatch software to upload mps to this player
i recommend you dont even install it
you can easily copy files using windows explorer to the player as it acts like another hard drive yes the documentation is awful
no matter if you know how to copy files from one drive to another you can operate this thing i think i have noticed a limitation
it skips on occasion when files are encoded at rates higher than kbps
most dont go above this level anyway but im pretty sure the occasional skips i get in the music are because the files are large and the drive is not reading ahead fast enough
rare occurrence though tech support is nonexistent
ive emailed them numerous times about general questions they dont include in their faq
sometimes they get back most of the time they dont
the one question i still wonder about is whether a defrag program like ms defrag or norton speeddisk is ok to use on this thing batteries generally take about  hours to recharge for every hour of use
i still havent used it to the point where it runs out of power completely but i just plug it in before going to bed and its usually fully charged by the time i wake up if you think youll want to use it as a portable recording device be sure to compare this to the recorderplayer archos also sells
this device doesnt have a recording ability
also note theyve come out with a gb player if you are an insane music nuti think thats it
like i said before i cant hang with those little mb players
its a bummer you cant take it jogging like the memory players but until they come out with mp players with gb of memory ill still say a harddrive mp device like the archos is the way to gohope this helpsaaah the french
so much expertise so strangely applied
the jukeboxk is a marvel marred by two bizarre unnecessary and serious flaws volume is a paininthebutt to adjust indeed cannot be done without looking and takes at least  keypresses and the battery replacement process seems to have been engineered by the same team that brought you the maginot line its a fiveminute process during which you are guaranteed to crack the plastic retaining clips
clearly too much damned wine and brie at the cad tablehowever i also note that  believeitornot  the internal hard drive can actually be replaced with a larger unit
righto
i swapped out the original gb drive for an gb model and am therefore relatively certain a gb drive  would also work
how about  hours of music
obviously kiss your warrantee goodbye but if you want lots of tunestogo well theres your ticketrock oni do love my jukebox
my coworkers say that i must be a sales rep for archos
within hours of my having brought it in the techno geeks from far and wide had found an excuse to swing by and take a look at the goods
props were definitely received for being able to use it as a data storage unit
once you get used to the idea of backing a huge data file off of your c at work and schlepping it home while listening to your hottest tunes youll wonder how you ever did without it
i find myself looking at other mp players and thinking quothow quaint  what a sweet little musiconly devicequot
and i smugly pat my jukebox and feel superior
one thing  it can be a finnicky piece of machinery
dont try jogging with it or bumping it around much at all
youll regret ithaving just purchased a sony cdrw from dell crx i had become totally frustrated with delland later discovered poor installation documentation in the bundle
the yamaha is fast well documented and supported in the bundle and you do not have to deal with dell  the noise complaints on this yamaha are unwarranted
it is not excessively noisy
and what a value with the rebate
i recommend this unit unreservedly at this price leveli installed this burner in a dell dimension with no problems
it now fills the slot where my dvd drive used to be
i was using the dvd so rarely that replacing it with a cd burner seemed much more practical
i also needed the ability to play cdrs on my machine which the yamaha does beautifully
i also own an external scsi yamaha cd burner which has been connected to my mac
installation was very easy and took fifteen minutes
the only drawback ive seen so far is that the unit gets somewhat noisy like a small jet engine when it goes into highspeed mode
i think this is fairly typical for highspeed drives and its only worth a minor mention
my bundle also came with the neato cd labeler software and some labels
although i havent used this product yet i look forward to comparing it to the other cd labeler products cd stomper memorex ive used previouslyupdate  i spent three hours last night trying to burn a cd for a friend using the ez with easy cd creator  i finally created my first coaster
i keep getting quotbuffer underrunquot messages which according to yamaha shouldnt happen with this model
unfortunately one solution is to slow down the recording speed which kind of defeats the purpose of upgrading to a faster burner now doesnt it
i need to do some tweaking as im not sure if its the hardware or the software
all i know is that i had no problems with my previous cdr software and am now questioning whether this was really an upgrade or notim not sure what all the bad reviews are about
maybe those folks bought earlier models or didnt read the instructions or have slowold computers or just dont do hardware very well
in any case i took a chance after reading the horrible reviews and bought this drive anyway
i already own  other yamaha burners a xx scsi and an xx eide
they worked perfectly until last week when the scsi burner blew out warranty expired
the scsi burner worked great while it worked
 my only complaint about this drive is that it it way too loud
whats up with that yamaha
i dont care if the drive spins a million times a minute theres no way it has to be that loud
other than the jet plane syndrome this drive is great
it installed without a hitch
burned a cd first time out of the gate and works fine all around
if youre thinking about buying this burner make sure you have a fairly fast pc and go for it
i put this drive on two machines and it worked fine
one is a pii  and the other is a piii  buy this burner if you can stand a little noise
the price is ok and keeps going lower
its much better than the hp x i returned instantlyive had this drive for about a year now
when it works it is very fast and relieable but it has configuation problems in  and xp when you first get it up and runningthe burning software that comes with xp should be enough for the average user it works quite well with for data and music
but if your going to make s of cds i would while running xp i would recommend that you dont install the roxio software inside and go purchase nerowith a little finetuning this can be a great drive but dont get it for a novice user as you will have to upgrade the fireware and default settings to get it humming at full speedthis is one of those purchases that will change your tv viewing life
this package arrived very quickly and was easy to setup  about  minutes including the call to start the service
basic service started immediately but some features began the next day because they needed the daily tivo dialupdate which takes place at  am or some such thingthe hardware is incredible
we will never watch television the same way
we are constantly getting up to retrieve our twoyear old from climbing furniture or rescuing cat from same
that used to mean one or both of us missed a lot of the shows we were purportedly watching
also we would have several vhs tapes wed be trying to keep track of  one with kids shows one halfway through with shows wed recorded while on vacation a couple with shows wed recorded but werent sure if wed watched them already or not
nothing labelled because all of it was temporarythat is over
with the minute buffer if we need to do something fast we just get up and go most useful for the toddler climbing furniture scenario and when we come back we press the reverse button and catch up with what weve missed
or if the cat is being chased we can take the time to pause the show before we jump up
and the instant replay feature has already gotten a lot of use at our house now that the ncaa basketball season has begun
its awesome
weve also set up the system to record our favorite shows during the week so now we dont even worry about what day or time it is
setting up to record a single show is fairly standard setting the system up to record a show whenever its on is very easy  no plugging in days and dates and times  just find the show alphabetically highlight it and press the select button though this has been problematic with some cable shows which replay shows multiple times
then we sit down when we are ready check the now playing list which shows what has already been recorded for you and watch whatever we want to watch
and we skip right past all the commercials
its very liberatingthe tivo layout of the simulated keyboard for entering keywords is better than on directvon the down side  wed had an rca directv receiver before this and preferred their online software and the remote
well i preferred that remote
my husband likes the philips remote because it is smaller
i contend that this remote is more confusing  with fewer buttons to work with sometimes you have to go through a series of menus to find a feature instead of just pushing one button
as with other software differences between the two systems sometimes it is just a matter of taste
but sometimes they are easily quantifiable for example with directv we could define  user lists and could access these lists with one button  when i was looking for kids shows i pressed a couple of buttons and then kids shows i had selected were the only ones that showed up on the grid
my personal list had movie channels and news shows my husbands had a lot of sports and travel shows etc
tivo gives you one list to customize
yikes
also menus are not wraparound
and sometimes buttons are contextdependent so they do one thing in one type of menu but something else if youre watching live tv for example
in addition it would be nice to have some tally of what amount of time is already stored
in other words the software needs work
this is one of those times when you wish a focus group had been brought inwe tried having the system record things based on what it thought we would like but found some truly odd shows using up our hour drive and so have turned that feature off for now
overall the system is very powerful but the user interface is clunky
that isnt a dealbreaker but it is curiousi give this receiver  stars  for the tivo service  for the tivo  software
the monthly or if you choose onetime fee for tivo service is quite reasonable
we have been using this component for about a month and with some slight reservations about software think its fantastichighly recommendedi own three tivos a standalone a hughes gxcebot directivo and now a philips dsr
i have been pleased with all three models and love how tivo lets me watch tv on my own schedule not the networks
for those who are switching from a regular directv receiver or are new to satellite service altogether a few caveats all three directivos hughes philips sony perform the same
the only differences are external  the hughes and sony are silver and the sony has a control link to control sony vcrs
so buy the one that fits best with your home theater system the dtivos currently as of  in stores have software ver
 to use the two tuner functionality you need only force a daily call or two after you finish the guided setup  the installation manual explains this simple process  and wa  la
ver
 will download and a new message from tivo will tell you how to activate the dual tuner functions
no sweat
 the directivo online guide is slower than those of the regular directv receivers
dont worry youll get used to it and as you begin to use the tivo more and more find that you surf less and less
alot of your tv viewing will be recordings the tivo or you have made the philips dsr runs hot
thats why i gave it four and not five stars
dont stack it with another component and make sure you have adequate head and side room in any rack system you put it in
otherwise the fan will run continuously and might annoy you the dtivos like the standalones and unlike ultimate tv can be expanded to add additional hard disk storage
so you can upgrade your  hour dtivo to  hours  hours  hours its up to you
all you need is a little pc knowledge and some gallyou can only use the dtivos to record satellite tv they wont work with cable or local broadcast tv buy a standalone tivo for that
but as of  nearly all your local channels are must carry for directv
go to their website to see which locals you can get via the satellitea final piece of advice if youre thinking about buying this productread the faqs and discussion threads  it may save you some frustration or disappointment if the product is not what you expected and will help you with any setup questions you may have like do i need a multiswitch and which one should i buy
its also a great way to pick up tips and tricks about how to make your tivo viewing more pleasurableif you cant tivo your life then at least tivo your television   good luck and enjoyi selected the dvc because i wanted a multidisk dvd player with excellent image and sound quality dolby and dts support but no decoder built in but also as a replacement for my disc cd player
so cd and cdr support was critical
cdvideo support is an added bonus but i cant see myself using it muchthe dvd image quality is superb  it is definitely worth using the component video outputs if you have a tv that supports them
i have seen other dvd players run into problems with scratched dvds andor highly compressed scenes giving poor picture quality
no such problems with the pioneer
the player loads dvds quickly and starts playing them quickly and i have yet to come across a dvd that doesnt work  even with a wide variety of dvds of varying quality from netflixcomregular analog stereo sound is great and the unit performs very well with regular cds  sounding just as good as my old nad cd player
digital audio outputs go to your external dolby and dts decoder via coax or optical interconnecti took off one star for the fact that the unit often does not recognize audio cds
you have to open the sliding tray reseat the cd and try again
reading the amazon reviews this seems to be a problem for lots of dvd players but it is still irksome
on the other hand the pioneer does have a cdonly mode which makes the unit behave more like a regular cd player for those times when you just want to listen and this goes a long way to compensating for the cd recognition problemsthe pioneer remote is logically laid out and easy to use
the onscreen menus are simple to understand and once you have the unit set up its unlikely youll need to use them again
the pioneer remebers where you were on a dvd if you push the stop button so that you can pick up exactly where you left off
some other dvd players dont seem to have this optionthe price of the unit seems very competitive to me especially when i compare it to single dvd units that often dont have component video output
i have no need for a builtin dolby digital or dts decoder as any recent surroundsound receiver contains those functions already
theres no point paying for extras you already owni am glad i bought my pioneer dvc consider it good value and would recommend it to anyonethese yamaha speakers are exactly what i needed for my mac
they deliver crisp sound with solid bass from the subwoofer
the units themselves are small h x w for the satellite speakers h x  w for the subwoofer despite their big sound
the left speaker has a large easytoadjust volume knob under the front grill the subwoofer control is less accessible on the back
the cables are short however keeping the satellites close to the monitor  you might want to get something else if you want to space the satellites a distance from the source
fortunately they cause absolutely no distortion to the displayfor the price you really cant go wrong with this speaker set
pc owners will delight in the superior sound coming from their computersi purchased it at a local store just for the brand
ive never read a review nor heard a word about that speakers
but i got surprised about how good it soundswell balanced nice highs and good bass considering the relatively small subwofer dimension
a little weak in medium range but it makes no harm to general sonic performanceok the thing people need to take into account here is that these cyyber acoustics acm headphones are extremely cheap price
i paid only about  here on amazon for themif youre looking for highquality sonics amazing music listening rich bass or extreme quality these are not for you
i would also not recommend them for small portable listening since theyre not very discreet and the cord is long however the fact that the cord is long is a good thing for those of us who need to sit some distance from our computer or other deviceif all you need is a cheap way to listen to your audio without disturbing others and youre not concerned with frequency range like a major audiphile would be these are fineperfect for just surfing videos on the web and casual use
music is ok but dont expect beefy lowend tones or nice wide frequency rangesfor  bucks they sound just fine and get the job done
if they were more than  then id be a bit more critical of them but in this case the quality still surpasses the pricequick delivery
good headphones for use with computer tutorials training dvds and cds
designed for smaller heads so i had to spend some time bending the center section of the headband to make it wider for my hat size  head but it worksthis is a nice gadget to have with your cameraits not that you will use it everyday but the moment you need it you will appreciate the money you have spend on itmy only complain thats why the  stars with my e the zoom buttons doesnt work although someone might as well say why do you need the zoom
you set the camera before you walk into the picture you press the button you smile and you are set if you begin zooming then you might as well lose the the picture you wanted to frame at the beginning dbeyond this small complain i will easily recommend it as an addition to all olympus camerasthis remote works well but a new one needs to be manufactured that supports more functions in the e and e camerasits just a remote control
i  wish you can operate the camera from behindi use this remote with my olympus e dslr camera
the remote has six buttons but only one of them the large one that activates the shutter is usable with my system and that is the one that is most important to me
the packaging that came with the remote was misleading in places
it stated that the battery tab could be removed to activate the battery
there was no battery tab in the remote
also unless the camera is set to receive ir commands there is no way to tell if the remote is operable or notno light comes on or anything like that
over all i am very happy with the remote as it does just what i want it to do
thanksolympus rm remote control for olympus stylus digital camerasnice little remote for your camera if you want to do selfportrate picturesi dont use mine that much but when i need it its therethe rm is very compact and easily storable in the smallest of places
i use it with my e evolt digital slr
with this camera only the large shutter button on the remote is usable
the other  buttons for zoom and  are not applicable to that particular camera
a bit of a disappointment after getting it but i probably wouldnt have used them anywaypart of the fun of taking group shots with digital cameras is the dance of setting the timer and running into the shot
watching the blinking light count down
this remote allows me to fire off my olympus e in either  or  second countdown from within the group
i actually purchased it to make time exposures because it is important not to physically move the cameras in bulb mode
i have not tried this yet but ill update the review when i do
i gave it  stars only because it is a very small unit and may be easily be misplaced
amazon had a nice price for thisthis is a great accessory i really like this for when wanting to take a self picture or for those awesome tripod shotsfyithis length works for me and ethernet wire connection is better than wireless for ft range and thick wallsi am very glad that i went with the longer cable
this cable works great
it does the job it is supposed to
i had to replace some older worn out old cables
if it were cat  i would have gave it  stars but this cable does the best it could beit works but i thoroughly dislike those snagproof plugs
id way rather deal with snagging than have to work so hard to disconnect the plug when i need tomemory for older computer
the speed may not match but still works well with in the systems limits
remember to match the bus speed always
the pruduct is a mact to the pc socketgot this for my over  year old windows xp machine because it kept freezing up with heavy cpu usage
good price for it with free shipping
increasing the memory solved the problem so far
or maybe it was because i blew away the  mm layer of dust that had settled over time on the cpu heatsink and fanthese sleeves are as good as any i have gotten
none fall apart as i read in review
i put as many as  disks in  sleeve
i copied a friends new dvd and made copies so he has the original and the kids use the copies and scratch thethese are white with a clear circular window
they have the usual locking flap
the paper is thinner than named products such as memorex
they are also less expensive so have to weigh that in
this is why only deducting  star instead of my biggest dissapointment is that the flaps dont come prefolded
they have the crease to show where to fold them but the flaps comes sticking straight up
its not a biggie to fold them unless you have a big project than it would get monotonous
another reviewer pointed this out but thought she was kidding
now i know she wasnt
i would probably not buy this product again even with the savings
for a few bucks more i couldve gotten better quality all aroundif high quality isnt a concern and are more interested in cost per sleeve than this is for you
if you want quality than spend a few more bucksthe paper is a little thin for everyday use  the flaps do not seal
however i bought these for achieving discs and they are perfect for thatthese are just your basic cd envelopes with windows
the package came without any bent or smashed envelopes so that was a plusgood price thin feeling paper it accomplishes protecting media as advertiseda good alternative to the jewel casecan also be used for dvdsmy only complaint is that you have to fold the top yourself
aside form that i think theyre great
it saves a lot of moneyit does exactly what it intends to do it is a sleeve for a cd
i dont know what all the fuss is about with the other reviewers
this is not going to protect it from breaking
it holds the cd so it doesnt get scratchedthese envelopes are a little thin but will work just fine for what i need
nothing fancy here but good enough
thanksi have nothing to say
i am just typing until the work could is below zero or greater than negative i like the sturdy feel of this surge protector
ive always had good luck with tripp lite products
the item was wellpacked and arrived on timetwo months ago i bought a precor  treadmill and much to my dismay turning the treadmill on would trip adjacent breakers in my apartment
i did a bit of research and apparently treadmills emit some type of interference that trips new style afci breakers used in new construction
lately ive had to shut everything off on these adjacent circuits just to be able to use the treadmill
very annoyingsome were reporting that the tripp lite isobarultra surge protector would filter this interference
i compared the isobarultra to the isoblok and they both seemed to have identical filtering capabilities so i picked up an isoblok since i only needed one outlet for the treadmill
i also thought it would be nice to have the unit plugged directly into the wall vs a box sitting on the floorunfortunately the isoblok does not filter the treadmill interference for some reason where the isobarultra does
im not sure why this is but there must be some additional circuitry in the isobarultra that the isoblok doesnt have despite having seemingly identical specsi decided to keep the isoblok because it is a solid metal quality surge protector for the price
ill probably find a way to use it in the futureone thing i dont like about the unit though is that it sticks out from the wall and isnt very sturdy plugged in
if bumped the unit could easily be kicked out of the wall damaging the unit itself the outlet and whatever is plugged into it
the isoblok is probably not good for high traffic areas but might be just fine behind a fridge if itll fit or somewhere out of the way
you can secure it to the outlet with a piece of metal that they provide but this wouldnt work with my type of outlets
even secured i wouldnt trust plugging the isoblok in a high traffic area outleti use the tripp lite industrial line at home and at work this one will protect my samsung fridge
tripp lite always makes good quality products
it fits the plug well not much more can be said im not an electrical engineer so i dont know how to actually test iti particularly like the quality of construction and led status indicators
the noise filtering feature is an added bonus
just wish there was an indicator light or audible alarm that notifies you when the unit has outlived is useful life
i understand that surge suppressors can only take so many hits before they self destructi wish the joule rating was a little higher but this is not bad all things considered
the clamping voltage is low which is a good thing and something that many competing products may not have
you see lots of product out there with high joule ratings and really high clamping voltages which is bad because with a high clamping voltage the chances of it tripping to protect your electronics is lower
this is a high quality unit fits good in my outletthis appears to be an industrial strength metal cased surge protector
i am using to protect my computer equipment including router and modem
instructions were a little confusing until i finally figured out what it was trying to say
a picture would have helped a lot
this unit is intended to plug into the bottom plugin of a two plugin outlet so in essence gives you three outlets  the wall top one and the two from this unit
then there is a metal piece that slides in top slot that allows you to connect the box to the center screw outlet cover screw so that it doesnt pull out of wall when and if you need to pull a plug
you need to make sure that you have at least  inches below the lower outlet to install it as intended
otherwise will have to plug into top outlet
this will work but it would leave only the two outlets and you would not be able to permanently screw it to the outlet screwthis review is  being written on amazoncom  for the tripp lite isoblok surge protectorpros  metal enclosure low clamping voltage high joule ratingcons unusual mounting method bulky best for vertical outletsive used other tripplite surge protecgtors for many yearsmountingthe manufacturer picture does not make it clear how this unit mounts to the wall outlet
as other reviewers have pointed out the plug on the back of this box is not centered
the box plugs into one of the outlets in a standard wall jack and the other wall jack outlet is not covered depending on which outlet you use
the wall cover stays in place so the surge protector does not mount flush with the wall
a rubber bumper helps keep the box fairly level with the wall
however the unit still wobbles
the protector is best used on a flush mounted wall jack that is oriented vertically with the protector plugged into the bottom jack
other outlets such as horizontal or ceiling mounted jacks example for a garage door opener or surface jacks found in some utility areas wouldnt be the best application
a small bracket helps keep the surge protector in place by attaching to the switch plate cover
however even with the bracket in place the surge protector can be removed from the wall jackspecificationsthe joule rating larger is better is excellent for a small surge protector
the clamping voltage lower is better is similarly excellent
the led indicators for protection present and wiring check are bright and easy to see and interpretothera paper sticker on the side of the surge projector states made in china
previous other tripplite model protectors i have purchased were made in usasummarythe specifications of this protector and reputation of tripplite for surge protectors make this purchase worth it for mehad to hook up the old printer to a newer computer with no ieee printer input
this cable did the trick
it works wellthis fixed my problem connecting my printer to my computer
i could not use the equipment that i had until i got this adapterthe cable works very well i now can use the printer i had forgotten due to the lack of parallel port in my computer
installation manual however goes only up to windows  which leads me to think that the product is rather old or that plugnplay usually takes care of this
i had a little puzzle to solve before i managed to make it work but in the end i realized that the printer spooler service was disabled from within windows
once enabled everything worked perfectlyi retired my last computer with a parallel port but still wanted to continue to use my trusted hp so i gave this cable a try
well it just worked i plugged the cable in the back of a computer running windows  the computer detected a new usb device and installed the printer automaticallyi then decided to be more adventurous and to try making this printer an autonomous networked printer by plugging it in the back of an apple airport express
then downloaded and installed the bonjour printer wizard to that the print jobs can be properly rerouted and again it workedi just wish the cable were a little bit longerworks well eventually
i have windows  bit and a laserjet  printer
the package came with instructions but they didnt work
eventually i had to download the new drivers from hps website after spending about an hour trying different thing
eventually i deleted a previous printer installation in devices and printers installed the hp drivers i downloaded rebooted and it workedin my research i found that while bit software will work in windows  bit drivers wont
if you have a bit operating system then you must use bit drivers
unfortunately the laserjet  drivers in my bit windows  operating system may be bit drivers because they didnt work
that may be why when i followed cables to go instructions all i got was stray printed characters
you can probably download the correct drivers from the windows update website but i couldnt find and download them
so if you have an hp printer the best bet is to go to the hp support website and download the universal print driver for the bit versions of windows  if that is your operating system
instructions that didnt work is the reason i give this  stars instead of  the product is well made packaged well and comes in beige which helps me quickly distinguish it from my many black cables
updateproduct doesnt work reliably when printing adobe acrobat files
prints the first page then freezes and finally prints garbage characters
have to stop the spooler services turn the printer on and off several times to clear it and then print one page at a time
this may have something to do with the manufacturers requirement that you set jobs to print directly to the printermy new laptop did not have a parallel port and i couldnt connect to my printer via the network because i work on a company vpn from home and my printer is local
this plugnplayed just fine and has worked without any issues since installation
i would definitely buy againpretty straight forward
if you need to connect a parallel device to a new computer this solves the problem without any issuesthis does work ok on a windows  newer laptop
but for some reason when i used it on an  older computer with windows  installed it worked at first then failedit still works with the other computer so im thinking its just the old computers hardwarethis thing saved an hp  from the trash heap
the network card went bad on this office printer
my it guy says the parallel port should still work
bought thisnow i have my own private printer in my office instead of using the shared network printer
the instructions are pretty clear
i plugged this thing in and win xp automatically took care of everything and it worked
however i read the instructions and they said to change some of the automatic defaults instructions are very clear in the packagingi did and havent looked back now for weeks
i just wish it came in a slightly longer cable length
your printer has to be very close to your printer with this length which works out to be about  feetjust too short to run around your desk
kind of commits you to having your printer on your desk
havent tried it with an extension cable so cant comment on thata generous family member donated a laser multifunction to our household
please coin a st century aphorism about family generosity with old hardware
if its a good one ill send you the printer and cablei bought the cable before checking the drivers
win  drivers no usb connection
i dont know how to make it gogreat cable thoughthis adapter cable is a very good product but since it is supplied without any installation instructions it can discourage users in many situations where plugandplay doesnt workit appears from some of the revieews here that your experience will depend largely on whether your operating system includes a driver for the printer youre installing
if the printers driver isnt included in your operating system it will not be plugnplay
for windows xp see this tutorial written for hp printers but its applicable to many other printers as wellfor windows  this tutorial may be helpful but the above worked fine for me in a windows  installationthe general requirement is to first install software included in windows for the  cable
with the pc on just plug the cable directly into one of the usb ports behind the pc
windows will install this adapter cable by adding a virtual usb printer port to the system and will indicate that usb printing support hardware has been successfully installedthen the second requirement is to select a port and find and install the driver for the printer
begin this by opening the windows printer and fax dialog and select add a printer
then select local printer and ignore info about usb printers will self install
next select the printer port usb virtual usb printer port
then youre taken to the install printer software screen
here your printer may not appear on the lists until you press the windows update button
afterwards find your printer under the appropriate list eg

finally select default printer and sharing as desired and print the test page
you may have to reboot to complete the process before the final stepi used this cable to install an hp laserjet  with windows  bit
for this printer and others that only have a minicentronic port one will need to attach this adaptercentronics cen female to minicentronics hpcen male ieee parallel printer adapterto the cable before installing the printeri have awarded  stars because of the lack of instructions otherwise a star producti bought one of these when i got my first micro four thirds camera
its been durable and because its disassembles in seconds into two parts its easy to pack
it worked perfectly for at least  years with no signs of wear
after one of my flashes failed to fire i tested it with other flashes and cameras same result
the cable with the attached hot shoe adapter is replaceable so i bought a new one more test same resulti replaced the bracket and the new one works reliably
one of the brackets two electrical connections must have failed hot shoe to flash or hot shoe adapter cable connector
i feel that i got my moneys worth and as the review title says i dont think that there is another option on the marketi use these on the e
the fit is perfect and for general walk around photography the bracket is perfect
if you want to get more creative however you would need a much more adjustable bracketamazons service was great
flash bracket is a fixed flash bracket and feels solid and works great with my olympus e with an additional flash cable
being it is a fixed handle this does not allow the flash to be flipped when the camera is turned vertically thus the flash is on the side rather than the top
otherwise very nicei have noticed that some of the knockoffs arent quite as good as the old amphenols and pomonasi cant recommend the former proven suppliers  cuz it looks like their stuff is made in china tooold surplus stuff on ebay is betterstill these things are quite cost effectivemilling is ok you may have to jiggle and twist to get it to fitthe locking collar may come off in your hand on a few ofmthe propolyne insulator may pop outat the price attrition is to be expectedsome of them are bound to survive break inbought this to place behind our new fridge
with all of the electronics in appliances we wanted to give it some protection to surges that might originate in the house something to keep in mind if you have a wholehouse surge suppressor
that will only help if a surge comes in from the outside
ill rate it  stars when it takes a bullet for the fridgenormal good quality
keeps cabling tidy when the computer is right by the power stripi end up buying short versions of a lot of cables for my desk and my living room gametheater setupit works what else can you say
it does what it is supposed to do and has not fried yetthanks to amazon for such affordable accessories
the only thing i noticed in comparison to my power cord that came with the tv the rubber shielding on this product seemed warm to to touch
otherwise a decent productthis cables to go universal power cord is a standard electronics power cord for devices such as tvs printers pc towers etc
we lost the power cord to my daughters printer and bought the  one as a replacement
it fits fine and works as expectedrecommendedcfhi added a dual mounting stand to my desk and the old cables were not long enough to go through the bracket and be plugged in
i probably should have went with something a bit shorter but these work great and give me more than enough flexibilityquality was good and it shipped fast
i needed this for an additional computer i had lost the cord tothis is a good power cord that is useful for hooking up a computer to a power outlet that is  feet awaythis cable comes at a good price for great length
the gauge is a bit on the thin side but it works it does what it is suppose to do
i needed one a little longer so i ordered this one and it is fineas other people have noted this cable wont work for anything and everything
supposedly its rated to  amps which is about  watts out of a us outlet at  volts
im not an electrician just a guitarist so dont quote me on that
regardless thats what a little googling got me
in some reviews people talk about the cable getting hot and not actually being able to take a something putting out  watts sustained over several hours
i cant comment on that since its not my situationheres my situation ive got several guitar and bass amps that i needed power cords for
i definitely recommend these cables for this specific use
most of the guitar amps im using them for are low wattage amps anyway
ive had no problems with overheating
im also not leaving my tube amps on for six hours at a time either
tubes are too expensive to do that kind of thing unless you are playing them
since im generally only using the power cords for  minutes to an hour at a time the cords wouldnt pose an overheating problem anyway
i do use the power cable with a w bass amp but again so far no problemsif you are considering buying these power cords as replacements for a low wattage guitar amp they should work perfectly for you
if you are using them for something that has a very high power draw you may want to look to a higher gauge power cordwe used this for a new ceiling installation of an old projector and it got us from the projector to the outlet
a good cableiec cables are ubiquitous these days  they are used on all kinds of computer and consumer electronics equipment
if you use the supplied cables which are usually six foot long for all your wiring it will lead to a nightmare of cable clutterthe solution buy short iecac cables of various lengths and use a cable just as long as you need  foot  foot  foot
the only way they could improve is by having them in length increments of every half foot up to about four feetthese are quality cables and are great for reducing cable clutteri use this for my amp head so i can power it from across the stage
does exactly what i want
perhaps a little on the thinner side as far as these go
but it does the job perfectlyi use four of these on my photography strobe lights they work well without any trouble
they are lightweight i would not recommend them for power tools construction sites etc
but they are not sold for that kind of worki plan on buying more of thesegot these for some powered speakers i was using and theyre good cables for the most part but the female end could use some more bulk
it had too much play when plugged in so i had to wrap some electrical tape around it so it wouldnt wobble in the porti needed a longer power cord and this one is just about the right length just like this sentence isi needed a longer than usual power cable for a third monitor in the corner
i didnt want to use an extension cord  less than  bucks its a good dealwhat can i say
as with the cat network cables that i bought this power cable is doing its job in stellar fashion and saved me a hunk of green at the same time  i will definitely get another if i ever need onei wish there would have been a three pack though
basic and solid
i like it
nothing to regret with this oneits a power cord
i plugged it in and it allowed electricity to flow from my wall to my projector
hell ill give it  stars why not its a power cordi use the ft cord for one of my dongles that power an amp
for me works fine no heat issues the plug both ends fit nice and snugmy amplifier draws low current so the cord is fine for my application but it could use a larger gauge for other application where one might draw much morethis is a standard universal power cord that i purchased for my additional lcd monitor
for the price it is a good buy
not too lengthy but fine enough for most desks if the socket is located behind the desk
i am happy with this product
doesnt ship right away but i did get the item before the expected delivery dateneeded a longer power cord for my projector for the  home theater
works great
exactly what i needed to reach the outlet stripthese cases come in cool colors seem sturdy and have a slim design which makes for convenient storage
the cases come together in a little cardboard holder which is a nice bonus for a storage optionthe front office needed an adapter to hookup an old printer to a new computer
figured amazon would have what i needed
they did quick ship with primegreat value in buying this product on amazon
i like adaptec products  they are solid performers and easy to installi have had no problems with installing or with using these
they do their job and dont give me any problemsrecommendedthe only reason i give  instead of  stars is that if i brush against one of the power strips with my leg it pops right out
the other  dont do this and i have no idea what the cause is
i solved the problem by putting a cable tie around the entire strip anchoring it to the leg of the workbench to which its attached
not an elegant solution but it worksthis was purchased to install into a cable management tray on a desk
i purchased it for its size  x 
works fine except it comes with no mounting holes or brackets
i had to fabricate my owni just received this yesterday and did a quick test to make sure it worked
so i can easily give it  stars for doing what its supposed to do
and based on other reviews here and from other sites it should last for years and years with no troublenow a couple of suggestions like others have said before rotate the plugs  so that large power pack plugs hang off of it if mounted horizontally rather than potentially getting in the way of other plugs
im handy with these kinds of things so i may attempt to open it up and see if i can rotate them myself
they appear to be perfectly square so it might work
ill post back up if it does
the power cord should come out of one of the sides or the endcap rather than out the front
maybe include a modified plug that can be opened up and spliced to a more exact length if necessary
 is great but i dont like slack and would prefer if i could shorten it myself
ill likely do that anyway with a  plug from home depot
would be a nice option thoughall in all it looks like a solid and dependable unit with plenty of plugs for my garage benchthis power bar is pretty good but loses a star from me because of plug orientationpros good quality nice mounting hardware included lots of plugscons orientation of the plugs is wrong
it is such that your ac adapters will interfere with the next plug
many people will buy this device to plug in a lot of wall wart power units and they can get in each others way
i would rather the plugs were rotated  degrees so that i could use ever outlet on the barobviously the reason to get such a big bar is to have enough space to put the wall warts otherwise we would buy one of the much more commonly available smaller units
this one doesnt quite solve the problem
still an improvement
the only brand i have seen that have the correct outlet orientation are prime  outlet power strips but they are poorly reviewedits just what i needed to add some outlets to my ht cabinetthe reason its  vs  stars is the cord
coming out the top  is not a real issue for me but for putting this in a cabinet or something similarthe cord is way too long and way too stiffi just cable tied the excess cord about  of it was excess and attached it to the top of the back cabinet walli do like the covered switch and the spacing between outlets
all in all a nice solid unitthis was the perfect solution for an installation of multiple transformers
it does cost a bit more than the other devices i looked at but none of them offered enough outlets with adequate spacing
if your situation calls for a device with this form factor you cant go wrong herethis little device is what it says and it does what it says it does  adapts to male connectors on both sides
you can use it to extand your male cable no not that cable
as needed
cant say anything negative about it and the price is rightthere is not really much to say about this product
it works just fine and as advertised so that in off itself is always good
thank youi simply cannot get too excited about a serial cable and even less so about a gender bender
this little device is what it says and it does what it says it does  turns a dude cable onto a chick cable or viceversa
construction is okay seems to hold up fine
the standoffs canbe removed and replaced as needed
cant say anything negative about it and the price is rightthis is a good recharging aa battery unit
i own both this one and the kodak k unit
 aa battery usage in my householdbusiness is rather common
this unit works just as fast as the kodak unit if not faster and has most of the same features
but i like the kodak unit betterthe storage space of the device is very important to me
i dont like carrying around dead weight that could be eliminated
the olympus unit is compact except for the extension cord it takes up more room than the unit itself
the kodak k is a wall mounted unit that does not require a cord
it fits perfectly into my camera bag without any hassle
ive never had a loose wall outlet attachment with the kodak if i did i would tighen it by pinching the plug slightly togetherthis olympus system and the kodak system both work very well
both are compact both recharge quickly
my preference is the olympus at home and the kodak on the roadcable was true white as desired to match my other mac cablesit is an average quality usb cable and does the job adequatelybought this after i bought a new multifunction printer which didnt come with it
i will never understand that
if its needed for the product to work than shouldnt they include it
duh
bought this and it works greati hooked up this cable wire to printer and it works just great
the only thing i would give a downside to is that it said it was just over sixteen feet well when i received the package the package said it was fifteen feet
that fact didnt cause me any problems but people who need that extra foot it could be a major headachethese have worked just fine connecting printers to pcs
cheapest price anywhere when i bought them from cables to go via amazonwould definately purchase again if the need would arise although i do wish for one change in design
if the cord entered the strip from the side or top instead of the end and if the reset for the amp breaker was located on the side or top as well then this would get  stars
construction is attractive solid and quite usable
the spaces between outlets allows for even large transformers
the brackets snap onto the power strip so installation is a breeze
the power cord borders on being too long but i needed it for this installation so just be aware of the ft length
the cord is of a heavy enough gage that i feel more than comfortable with the power strips  amp capacitya good solid piece of equipment for a workbench
great to have a  cord
i just wish the two ends and maybe a point in the middle just had holes in them so you could just screw it directly to your wall or benchtop with a couple of drywall screws
that would be incredibly easy you could install the thing in seconds
using back mounting holes slot things or needing to use a separate mounting bracket are kind of stupid when the solution could be so simplegreat power strip
not quite wide enough for the oversized wall warts that power our electric pianos
but still an excellent stripi have a variety of set top type boxes by my tv
they all seem to connect via an hdmi cable and i had a rats nest of long cables behind the set
i set out to correct this using a variety of items
one was a short cable to connect my monitor to my router which was located right next to each other
another helpful device was an hdmi in out hdmi auto switch with  ft cable
several aurum ultra series  high speed hdmi cable with ethernet   pack  ft took care of several  cables nicely
i also added a tripp lite ps power strip v r  outlet ft cord vertical metal urm which has room for all those pesky power supplies that wont fit on a regular strip
i am very happy with the results of all of this and it all came from amazon at great pricesfeels very solid metal housing
switch feels robust too
includes mounting hardware
great for a shop nice long plug tooive had this for over a year now and enjoy it
very solid piece
the one thing they cuold do is simply space out the plugs a tad more so you can get right angle plugs in there without hitting another power brick other than that this is a nice and i feel  it will last for some timenigelthis works well but when mounting it horizontally the enclosed mounting hardware will not keep it in place when unplugging a cordthe entire unit will fall to the floortriplite needs to revisit the way these outlet strips mount before a law suit does it for themi am still waiting to give it a good test
i am still refurbishing my old hp deskjet c but i will be readyhooked it up and it worked great
looks well made and i have had no problems with it so far
good cable for the pricei thought it was snagless when i bought it but i was looking at a lot of cables so probably my fault there
nice relief fins just aft of the connector but that locking tab is just scraming to be ripped of if you are mucking with the wire or trying to pull it out of a bundlethey either works or it does not
these worked fine
verbatim is a brand that has i feel has always been goodfirst let me point out the bad its labelled as a lapel microphone yet the clip hardly fits most shirts
the bit that the microphone is supposed to sit in while not in use or to hook to a monitor doesnt stick to objects very well
the cord isnt well shielded at all against electronic interferenceother than that its a great microphone provided the intended audio to be recorded is voice
dont expect it to do too well for music
the resulting quality is spectacular for such a cheap device though you need to make absolutely certain the cord isnt touching any power cables or anything that carries a charge lest your audio be plagued with buzz
using the noise reduction function of an audio editing program may be desired if the only audio in a recording is a voice clip from this microphone as it isnt without its own ambient noiseits small light weight and low cost
it works well for my kids who destroy headsets etcthe holder mounts with doublesided adhesive tape which is poor quality and low adhesionthe clip on this is just barely big enough to fit over thin fabric but not over cords or collarsbut did i mention its very low cost
also it worksive purchased so many of these because the sound quality is good but the quality of the product itself seems to be subpar as ive had to replace it numerous timesthe sticky part on the back is not all that good but i just went and bought some that was good
other then that this works great and has held up to  kids pulling on itworked well for my purposes
i wanted a sound track to go with action i recorded on my pc monitor
this very inexpensive microphone did a very good job
note that to make this work the mic
needs to be placed close to the speakers
not high fidelity as you would expect from the price but voices come through very clearly
i may purchase a better mic
for musici needed an extra usb connection port on my desktop
i had an empty slot at the back
i bought this one popped out the plate plugged it in and away we went
simple enoughworks very well only gripe is the length of the cable which was a bit short in my case and needed some juggling the extention cards around to get a free slot close enough to the usb pins of one of my motherboardsok your computer motherboard has an unused x malepinned header that serves up two usb ports
those are usually there in case you happen to have internal devices that expect to be powered controlled andor configured as usb devices
and your normalheight computer case has an unused slot in the backwho cant use more external usb ports right
so plop down the   sh get this thingthe wires are short
i measured them at exactly  from base of the usb port to the very end of the wire header
since the usb ports actually sit an inch or more above the mobo in practical terms youre not going to get much more than  inches of reach
if you need an  extension cable look at item cab vended at frozencpu
even the wire color is a matchthere was a catch
the female end of this gizmo that plugs into the motherboard was mispinned
swap the pins into the correct location and youre goodgoon the motherboard the correct pinout for a single usb internal header ispin red v powerpin white usb datapin green usb datapin black groundpin void or an optional heaviergauge black wire for sgnd signal groundi recd this gizmo pinned aspinredpinvoidpinwhitepingreenpinblacki had to carefully move the female pins around to correct thisuse the smallest jewelers or eyeglass repair flattip screwdriver you can find
gently and eversoslightly lift the small restraining flap in the plastic terminatorthe end to lift is found at the lower edge of the little open square that reveals a part of the pin
the pin should slidedrop right out
then slide the pin into the correct slot
the pin will click in place behind the restraining flap
dont bust the flap off or  well you knowwhile this fix is simple enough you can be sure that thousands of customers created immense amounts of costs and work for the manufacturer and vendors when they simply returned these things after finding the usb ports didnt workas such you can also be sure that somewhere in some distant part of the world the worker who built tens of thousands of these incorrectly  a worker whose only job description was insert pin as red pin as white   has now returned to a career in agricultureupdate i bought another one of these in august  it came correctly pinned aspinredpinwhitepingreenpinblackpinblacki guess the first one was just a oneinazillion dudand besides i figured it was worth the cost as a small insurance that it would be compatible with the c
wouldnt want to burn out a fine camera
my only other somewhat negative comment is that the cord could be a little longer
its only six feet and that makes it a bit tricky to maneuver around for family shots on christmas morning or a birthday party etc but an extension cord is an easy fixthis is a great battery adapter for the olympus c series digital cameras
however depending on what your application is you might want ot use a different product
if you are viewingediting your pictures on a tv screen then use this productif however you are downloading pictures into your pc then use an external reader such as the viking intelliflash reader
the external reader wont use up the batteries in your camera in fact you wont even need to tie up your camera
just remove the memory card from the camera and insert into the external reader to upload
if you have more than one memory card then the camera can go back into action and you can download the other memory card whenever you have the timefor my application the external memeory card reader is a much better application than this ac adaptori use this to connect laptops to my  nd monitor through a kvm
nothing fancy
the cord was good quality not too thin like some projector cords but not insanely gurthy
connectors are easy to use and its black  so it hides itself well
signal quality is probably a factor at ft but due to my setup there is nothing i could blame solely on this cord  it works perfect for mesurge protector and described and pictured
has eight convenient outlets and is mountable so nothing laying on floor
no complaintswould recommend to anyonei like these
they are substantially more expensive compared to other surge strips but these are built like a tank and leave the impression they wont cause your house to go up in flames if something goes wrong
the case is metal they are heavy and appear to use quality components
i have most of my computers and home entertainment devices plugged into these and have never had a problemi have  things plugged into it
no problems so far
i guess i will not know for sure until we get surges in the buildingusing  wall anchors and screws not included you can securely mount this power strip on a wall using the mounting bracket built into the backin general the strip is well built but the tabs that come with it to cover unused plugs feel like they might break when pulling them out mainly because the plugs are so tight
to get around this i insert them only half way ini can only imagine this suppressor is doing its job  how could i really be sure
anyway this one has an excellent  cord with sidemount plug and feels solidly constructed in a metal case that will probably contain any firerelated issues during a surge as opposed to those plastic units which ive seen pictures of all burned up
the outlets have a fair amount of spacing between them maybe not enough to plug in  wallwarts but probably could get  of them on the outer corners and then regular plugs on the inner  the only negative i could give this for which i gave a star rather than star rating is that when devices plugged into this are on it seems to emit a buzzing noise
at first i thought it was coming from my speakers but i tracked it down to this suppressor
it was loud enough to hear when there was no audio playing but not enough to hear when audio is actually playing so not a big negative but it would help to make sure this is buried behind speakers  cabinets  other equipment to help muffle that buzzing sound
it could be that only my unit that does this i only have one so nothing to compare againsteveryone says tripplite stuff is supposed to work
its a substantial and heavy piece of equipment with a classic and plain nononsense design
the detailed technical diagrams and explanations on the outside of the box is an encouraging sign it shows that this company is using substance to target literate and intelligent consumers unlike a company such as monster which like bose just lives off its marketing hypei chose this for a new flat screen hdtv and bluray player
i know its not the home theater designated isobar model but didnt want to pay an extra  just for thati figure this will do the job
surprisingly it does seem to have cleaned up the tvs antenna reception a little by perhaps well built heavy duty construction
high level of guaranteed surge protection
i use with my guitarbass amplifiers
ill probably purchase the fouroutlet version as welli bought this unit because it had a more industrial look and feel than others
it has a few design elements that i really like as well
it has a  cord  solid metal enclosure   joules of protection  offonreset switch  low profile  degree plug  fault line ok protection present indicators and a  amp breaker
i couldnt find the country of manufacture on the unit the box or documentation inside the box so i called
it was  of course  made in china
if i had been able to find a similar product made in the us or anywhere else in north america or western europe
i would return this in support of those areas
alas no luck
there is absolutely nothing wrong with the product i simply have several problems with supporting chinaonly issue i have had with this protector is that it kicked out with a space heater plugged into itother than that it has worked great and i keep all my major electronics plugged into it and it has done fineit is pretty beefy and well made that and the reputation of the company were my deciding factors in the purchase of this itemi gave it  stars because of the issues with plugging a space heater into itthis product worked just as good as they said it would and you just cannot beat it for the pricebe advised there are no fault protection or line ok lightsonly the switch lights when onhow are we to know if the surge protection is still activeafter many surges the movs can cease to functionthe other models have a protection light to indicate the movs are goodalso the cord to the switch is as heavy as the power cordmaking it difficult to routeas always this is top quality in a surge suppressorthanks    kenthis cable release does what it claims no more no less
i use it for an e it can also be used for the newer e
unfortunately a different model has to be used for all other olympus  cameras a usb cable release
i wish olympus had standardized on one or the other but theyre no different from other camera manufacturers in this respect
otherwise cable release seems wellmadethis is the standard electronic cable release for the e body as well as some older models
it attaches very securely to the dedicated socket on the side of the e body
like the old fashioned style it features a lock mechanism for bulb exposures
otherwise it is a duplicate of the oncamera  shutter buttonmy main gripe with this well built device is the length of the cable too long
the whole thing is some  inches
to took mine apart and shortened the cable to a more manageable  inches or so
this is not for the faint of heart as the moulded stress reliever end is bonded to the wire
after cutting it to length i drilled down through the stress reliever and then pushed the wire back through it
this of course requires opening up the body of the remote and doing some soldering
but it works finei am happy to finally have an olympus body with a wired remote even if the rmcb is a tad longoverpriced by a factor of two but its the only game in town
i use it for getting a certain kind of shot
i put the e at the end of my monopod point the live view screen down and hoist the whole thing high over my head
this way i get shots from the perspective of a  foot tall person helpful in some situations like parades crowds and riotsi have never seen anything poorly made from olympus
but i have seen them take advantage of us by charging way too much for proprietary bits and pieces
oh well you know if you need a cable release and if you do this is the only thing that will work for the e or egot this just a few days ago to connect a friends yearold gateway  desktop  pentiuum  mb memory win first version to her verizon dsl wbelkin router
my expectations were low but surprisingly it worked
installing the card itself in the pc was easy
however win could not access any of the files on the supplied cdrom
the downloaded compressed drivers file from the startech site did have a win driver that i was able to eventually install
the downloaded info refers to the card as being by realtek by the way
works just fine with the belkin me router original router setup was done on a laptop with win xp
lastly it was a little annoying to see the price for the card on the startech site was only while finishing up a fresh install of windows xp on a  year old pc i found that the network drivers would not install and determined it was a hardware issue with the adapter
the light was on the old network card but no matter how i tried to update the driver the pc wouldnt accept iti purchased this pci network card as a cheap last ditch effort to be able to get the computer updated via the internet
when it arrived i popped open the case pulled out the old card and attempted to install this one
the fit was off
a bit of gentle bending was required to screw it into proper alignment in the pci slot so that the port was accessible
once i got it seated and fired up windows xp recognized it as new hardware immediately and installed a driver for it even before i could put the driver cd in the drive
i installed the updated driver from the cd and the internet connection was immediate
i was thrilled to have that fix go so easily and work so wellthis is a cheap card but it works
id buy another one and recommend it to others
it comes with two sizes of slot backings so if you have short or tall pci slots on your computer this card will work for you
its also compatible with xp vista and windows this was a low cost solution to fix a small networking problem
worked well out of the box and still kicking
cheap fix priceless resultsfor this price you dont get bells and whistles or fastfastfast network speeds
its just a little commodity card suitable to replace a failed chip or card on an older machine
it plugged into my old second machine and did what it said it would do
a good generic card for nondemanding usesseems to work great xp just loads it automatically
inexpensive but throughput test seems to be goodi installed this not right under my card but one slot below that since it gives the air some time to leave the gpu and enter the antec fan
im not getting the best cooling right now since my front case fan isnt up to par so make sure that is in order before expecting to see huge results
realistically i only see about  degrees difference  idle have not tried under a load yet ill update when i get a better front case fani bought two just to get better air flow throughout my full tower case
these do get the job done but they are really noisy
especially two of thembut im overall satisfiedsimple and clean
i added this cooler next to my radeon hd  which had an axial fan instead of an external exhaust blower
i believe i had temperatures drop as much as  degrees c although in a case with better airflow this fan may not be necessary
i can feel the air being blown out of it heat up when the card is under load and cool down when its not a sign that is does indeed exhaust air used by the card
its worth it this onei got this fan to sit between twosapphire radeon hdvideo cards
i only had one slots worth of space
unfortunately the fan only draws from one side and heat built up on the other
you can pull the fan off the backplane mount and reverse the direction
in the end i gave pulled it out because the fan wasnt far enough back into the case to effectively move heat away from the gpupulls a lot of air out of the tower but gets quite noisy if you dont clean itthis is really a great little feature that pushes the hot air away from sound and graphics card
caution
very loud
i repeat
this think is load
but really helps with coolingi stuck one of these next to my graphics card just to see if i could keep it a bit cooler since i run it on load frequently
long story short it does just that
i noticed an average of  celcius drop in average temperature
sure it really isnt all that much but i was still rather impressed
it is also very quiet a nice little plussurprisingly its not as loud as i thought it would be
works as advertised
i only wish i could have the input draw from the bottomthis item will blow heat out thus far i have had no issues with noise or broken fan
it does blow out air at a nice rate
this is great for putting under agp cards such as radeon series
i have noticed at times a  degree change since i have installed the fan
i belive it could be more but i have my pc in a less then vented area so that is probably the other issue
however you can expect the  degree cooler on your card
summer is coming up it doesnt hurt to have a extra exhaust if you have the space
its great for the buck and does the jobgot this to install to help with extra heat from gpu and does the job
without getting into direct gpu board addons one of these in the right place can go a long way to help with airflowif you are trying to get some stuff to keep your case cool this is a good option the only problem you could have is that you need to have a considerable available space inside i have connected  pci devices and it was a little hard to find a strategic position for this coolerfor what it does it does it well for a good price
the sucks hot air out of my computer while being less noisy than my powersupply fan
the psu plugs are also nice and slick so its easy to plug into or removethe fan works for now
other users have complained about longevity issues
i just installed this thing and turned my pc on in the last  minutesi can tell you it is not silent but not super loud either
if noise isnt a thing you care about and have an extra expansion slot and a power supply with extra power then why not go ahead and get thisthis sucks air in and blows it out of your computer
do not put it in front of your graphics card fan as most graphics cards suck air in to the card
if you put this right in front of the graphics card fan this will be competing for air with your card and your card will run hotter and have an opposite effect than you might wanti bought this blower to help cool a passive nofan graphics card
i wasnt expecting much based on other reviews in here but it definitely does the job
my gpu temp dropped a solid c under load
it is not quiet its a blower not a fan but it is background white noise that blends with the restso keep in mind ymmv with this blower
if your cards have fans and your case has multiple fans dont expect much of an improvement
but if you only have a psu fan cooling your case this will give you that airflow boost you needi hope this blower is durable
but if i have to buy a new one after a year i wouldnt complainupdate  after about a month of use ive decided to run the blower at v
it is now much quieter nearly silent and still cools just as well as beforethis fancooler succesfully extracts a lot of hot air at a good rate but you have to pair it with a good intake too like a cm fan at more than rpm on the front panel i have a gtsc and it lowered the general idle temp from c to  and chipset from c to c its not that much but helps when gaming for  or more hours cause temps rises up a little bit slowly than before and at  bucks it seems to be a budgetthis is my second case cooler fan of this type
this fan works quite well circulating air and keeping my tower case cooler
it is a bit noisy this slighting  star from  stars although not too noticeable along with normal average room sounds
if youre looking for silence look elsewhere
if youre looking for performance at a low cost you cant go wrong here
since this fan is used to circulate a lot of air from within the entire rather dusty computer tower i recommend cleaning it at least once a year for optimal performance and longevityit did moves good amounth of air does some noice not too much but it is not the ultimate solution for making your case coolerif you have no more choices i will recomend it if you can do anything diferent try iti have  fan in my pc to keep it cool some blowing on memory chips others on the x dual core xeons quad core  to keep everything cool
this fan does a good job of blowing the hot air out while the cooler outside air is being sucked it
not to bad if a itemwish the fan was a little faster however it does the jobthis fan is pretty straightforward you install it in an open slot connect it to a molex power adapter and when your pc is on it blows
this ish purchase completely cured the problem i had with my ati radeon  overheating
only downside for me is the molex power adapter its  put a sata power adapter on itreasonably priced  blower case fan i installed above my overclocked graphics card to remove the excessive heat it generated
it is doing a nice job in that respect and lowered the temp
of the gpu about  to  degrees cthis fan is not real noisy though it is not silent it is slightly louder than the other exhaust fans on this computer
small sacrfice for the good it doesoverall a good buy for the moneyitem works as advertised
this was a replacement for one purchased  years ago
its in a industrial environment and used to switch inputs on cnc milling machines to different cad computers
robust and cheaphaving purchased this a few months ago it has protected my tv plugged into the unswitched outlet  computer from a brief power outage  several flickers
in that sense im glad i purchased it
i dont use this as an underthemonitor unit because i have a laptop
rather i use it to protect my home entertainment system where it sits snugly with my dvd player  vcr
being that i also dont want my electronic devices to draw phantom power i purchased this so that i can leave things i dont use much powered completely off without having to reach behind things or under the table
but as there are  leds that are always on even when the master power is off i was concerned about the surge protector drawing phantom power
so i used a watt meter  found that it only draws  watt with no load which is considerably less than each of the things i have plugged into itmy concern is its design  quality of construction
the master power switch sticks when i depress it
the overall shape  feel of the switches are kinda strange
i dont understand why they cant be square or round
the switches should also be a different color from the casing to make them more visible as well as the lettering on the front  back which are difficult if not impossible to read
the documentation on the layout of the outlets  their purpose is really bad
the picture on the box cover contained the only useful information so i took a picture of it for future reference
the power cord should also be detachable like tripp lites ups version so that i can use the cord length i want
the cord on this unit is much too long for my use
i want to open this unit to see what makes it tick  to see how i can replace the cord but i cant since the screws are not removable without special tools
i guess if it ever breaks i can get a free replacement
hopefully by then tripp lite will have a new and improved version
its too bad there arent too many choices out there
if more manufacturers made these things  advertised them as a part of your home entertainment system instead of for big fat monitors that few people  businesses have these days there would probably be better productsthis unit replaced an old kensington masterpiece that had started having problems with sticking switches
the tripp lite product seems basically comparable
interestingly the box describes the clamping rating as  joules more joules mean more protection
advertises the red text but a sticker affixed to the box says  joules which is what the amazon product description indicates
somewhere along the line presumably the level of protection was reduced by the manufacturer
the mtplus case is plastic but strong enough to hold my  flatscreen monitor with no problems and the power cord is exceptionally long
although amazon indicates that this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer it is still listed on the tripp lite website as of product is great
i use it to switch onoff monitors on my  monitor computer setup
nice stats lights
good price
advertised as  outlet unit but need to know this setup power switches main each to individual switched outlets on back outlets connected to main only powers on w main  corresponding switch unswitched always onwhat can i say this is about the only company that makes the under monitor type surge protectors becasue rally very few people need them anymore
but if you need one this fits the bill it does workit feels very light and i wonder about what is actually inside being so light
i cant verify how well it protect anything as i have not had any surges yet but i really bought mine  to make plugging in my table top cnc machine simpleri give  stars becasue for me the price is fairly outrageous
i got lucky and walmart had these for 
i bought  only to find out it was a mistake but walmart did honor the price  but within  hours they were  againof course at  they are a ten star at  and more i am not sure they are worth it unless you absolutely must have an under monitor item
you can get a better higher rated surge protector in a different format for much less money
if cost is not an issue they are working great for meour other tripp lite surge protectorsuppressor finally died after over  years and where we live we have dirty power
the power drops and rises to unexpected levelsthis product came within the expected time frame and basically all we had to do was plug it in and connect the critical computer pieces of equipment to the tripp lite
the most recent time we had another power drop the trip lite worked perfectlyi use this to protect an apple mac tower computer and cinemadisplay monitor
we have a problem with our older houses wiring  every time the heatingac kicks on theres a brief power lagthe tripp lite lc smooths out the power during these occasional brief lags and we know its working because i can hear the tripp lite click when the ac kicks onthe only negative and it could be a big one for some people is the lc gives off a slight hum
i wrote tripp lites tech support about this and they said this sound is normal
so i wouldnt use this in a room intended to be completely quiet like a home theateri had a problem with a power surge that damaged some very expensive radar equipment and this was recommended by an electronics company
i have no way of knowing if it works properly because of the nature of its operation but i felt the cost was insignificant compared to the equipmant it may protecti was very pleased with the quick delivery and the cost which was much lower than the electronics company quotedi would characterize this line conditioner as a good entry level device for what it does that is  simple surge protection noise suppression voltage regulationmeasurement and line diagnostics
i bought it to measure and condition ac power received from a gaspowered generator intended for recreation and household emergencieswhen i plugged it in and turned it on i noted that it does make a faint humming noise but certainly nothing that i would consider loud or irritating
i tested it on both my generators output indicated solid  hz frequency stable voltage good line  nice and a few outlets in the house
i purposely tested it on a series of extensions that i know is overloaded and it correctly alerted me to a line fault  no device in this price range is going to give unlimited protection against voltage spikes and brownouts but this one seems perfectly welltailored for the lowtomedium range voltage spikesbrownouts one might see in typical home applications
i havent yet tested its noise suppression capability but plan to do so on some pretty sensitive pro audio equipment  and ill update this review if that reveals anything negativei gave it four stars instead of five just for the overall appearancepackaging of the unit which struck me as a bit awkward rough and cheapish  a minor subjective issue
it otherwise seems to be a good device that i would recommend to a friendi have a client that has power issues caused by a high voltage welder of the next door company voltage reading  volts when using
power company says its not something they will or can fix
i put this inline first and then added an avr automatic voltage regulatingups to protect the computer and telephone equipment
already lost the hard drive of my voip system after a couple of months
so far power seems to have leveled out a bit
time will telli use on a cad cutter in my graphics business
purchased after replacing a  fried motherboard
until i got this thing i had no idea how often i had power anomalies
audible click when overunder power condition exists
i can only assume its working  sure provides peace of mind over surge protecter which only protects against power surgesi had purchased a generic port kvm and the video was badly degraded so i decided to go with this port model based on the reviews
there was a significant difference right away as the video is flawless and mousekeyboard emulation is consistentyou can even boot up one computer while working on another or hot swap systems which is great if you test or repair computersthe only problem i had was switching between computers using the hot keys
the manual says to press ctrl  alt  shift then the port number then enter
i could not get it to work
a call to iogear tech support at  in the morning they have  hour phone support
clarified the situation
instead of pressing ctrl  alt  shift together you must press them in rapid succession ctrl then alt then shift then port number then enter
is not very elegant but it does workthis unit gets  out of  stars only because it may not work with the following usb mice or mice with multiple buttonsfeatures usb keyboards or keyboards with custom buttons wireless mice or keyboards
my kensington expert mouse works but is demoted from a four button mouse to two buttonif you can live with a standard ps mouse and keyboard this is a solid choice probably the best kvm for the moneywhat else can i say cable works as intended and with free amazon prime shipping was a real bargain
recommendedcant say much about it other than it works and looks like a monitor cable
nothing really intuitive about it
if you are using it as an extension cable with another monitor cable one end will not be secured as they both have male screws on them
other than that it appears to be high qualityi bought this to extend my kvm cables and its as good as tripp lite always is
the only issue the screwon barrel nuts provided used to connect this cable to another cable because both of those cables have male thumbscrews arent long enough to allows both sets of thumbscrews to bottom out resulting in the cables not being held tight to each other
so far no problem they are staying together from friction but id feel better about it if i never even had to worry about it because the screws worked as intended
and why wouldnt a monitor extension cable have the right hardware on itafter a recent lightning storm my phone line went dead
i determined that nothing connected to the line in my house or workshop was causing the problem and called the telephone company for service
the telco serviceman found an old surge suppressor across the line at the junction box outside the house
this must have been installed by the previous owner of the house
it was shorted out apparently having given its life to save my indoor phone equipment
unfortunately the label on the device was long gone and i was unable to search out a direct replacement
so i bought two of these
like the old one these have a short wire for grounding
however these suppressors are designed to go as close to the device to be protected as possible not on the line outdoors
the instructions say to connect the ground wire to the chassis of the device to be protected satellite tv box modem electronic wireless phone base etc
this was easy on my satellite tv box
however my wireless phone base is in a plastic case with no external screws that connect to the ground or chassis
i was able to open the case route the wire through an existing hole in the bottom of the case and attach it to a grounded circuitboard mounting screw
however if you are not comfortable doing this you may wish to purchase a different type of protectortripplite is an excellent name in surge suppressors and i am confident that these will protect my equipment
the only reason i gave four stars instead of five is that they havent been put to the ultimate test yeti hope this unit protects a cisco small pbx in one small office affected by lighting storms
we purchased  of this installed a delta ground ground bar and connect it to protect the  analog lines
so far is workinggood price have not yet had a dudlove the printable label area so i can use sharpy to label themive used half of the cds to copy music and have had no problems
its a good product for the money
recommendedi have had good luck with these over other brands tending to make less coastersmaybe my burn likes the taste of tdk over other mediaprice could have been better but they showed up at my door and i did not not have to drive to get themthese cds are great for the price you pay on them
you get a large amount for cheap
they hold all of the songs i could need on them and the music sounds great thats downloaded onto them they are a bit weaker than the more expensive cds but still have all you could want for the pricei took my older pc to best buy  geek squad  to see if they knew why it wouldnt start
after spending  they told me it was the power supply the motherboard a virus and that i should just buy a new pc
i did a little shopping on amazon and found this power supply so i decided to buy it and install it myself
my pc started right up with no virus or motherboard problems to speak of
i guess if i knew it was only a power supply i could of saved the money going to geek squad
the only problem i had was the screw holes in the tower didnt match up good with the threads in the power supply housing
i was able to use a few but not all of them
it is very secure even without using every screw
i read a few reviews prior to buying and other people mentioned drilling new screw holes in the tower but that is not necessary
i hope to get a few more years out of this pc now
i give it  starsit works ok installed without problems but the software that controls it is a bit unintuitive
figuring out how to configure it takes a bit more competency than the average user might have
but once its configured it works as expectedi have several of these protecting my electronic devices
so far so good  maybe it is just wishful thinking but weve taken some lightning strikes fairly close and havent lost anything yeti researched options before choosing the isobar    outlet surge protectorssp
my old sp were no longer working properlylike the metal housing and the status lights are preferred over guessing if the units are still working
using the  outlet models with my tripplite ups
 outlet models are for my other electronics which dont need to be on ups just good surge protectorsas surge protectors go tripp lite is one of the most respected names in the business
this unit demonstrates why it is built like a tank and uses very high quality components at least as can be seen without opening the case
the switch has a good feel and clicks properly
the outlets themselves grip the plugs well but are not difficult to use
what more can you ask
well good surge protection
ive only once had a protector actually respond to a surge in regular use
that day several of my neighbors lost electronics and i lost an unprotected television
my computer monitor and printer were protected by this model surge protector and survived without damage
ive used tripplite ever sincei have one amp that has a constant low hiss
i was hoping the filters in the isobar would clean up the power to get rid of it
seems like if i want to use that outlet i have to try other things
taking my amp issue out i think this is a well made product with some nice features like the included safety coversbought this as a last resort since my treadmill kept tripping the breaker in our new house new fangled gfcis
no trips since the addition of the isobar
bought a few more for the pc as wellsolid antisurge device
has industrial quality and feel
but the wallmount could be redesigned so that the back panel can be removed for mounting and then the rest of the device snapped into the backing plate
as it is you must mount wall screws and hang the device
unfortunately you cant get a screwdriver in there once its mounted to sheet rock on a hollow wall so the device tends to hang limpi had to have a fairly new smart tv repaired because the power board was fried
the technician recommended this protector and said it should cover just about any surge i might experiencei use this surge protector to protect my old tube tv yes really and stereo system
it seems well made  metal case and the outlets appear to be of good qualitythis thing does what it advertises it protects and has the construction of a tank
however people need to make sure they check it on a monthly basis
there is a little light that comes on when the protection on this goes kaput yes this happens with all surge protectors but at least they put an indicator on this one and if its illuminated your surge protector is not protecting anythingi dock a point simply because it still will not protect from multiple highimpact surges which my new surgex unit does
ive since moved this to less mission critical equipment
its certainly better than any other surge protector but surgex is so far the only company ive seen that can stop any surge multiple times without wearing out and up to the strength that any higher and the spark is already arcing in the wiring in the wall itselfthis is the second lc that ive bought through amazon
this one replaces a failed belkan ups used on a cluster of family room electronics including tv stereo dvr blu ray wd tv live a windows pc and some other items
the batterybackup aspect of the nowdead ups was a nice plus but what i really need in this spot is a solid line conditioner to mitigate power surges from a laser printer in the adjacent room as well as the usual peaks and dips of utility power
this tripp lite box does that job perfectly has sufficient and acceptablyspaced outlets and more than enough capacity
cheap insurance to protect expensive electronics that are frequently killed unbeknownst to many people by power fluctuations and spikesits only four stars instead of five due its rather utilitarian industrial design
but where it counts inside its five starsi purchased this to protect my av system and to get rid of the electrical noise issues
it levels out the voltage and doesprovide some noise filtering but the level of noise filtering was not sufficient to solve my noise problem
my av system isin my mancave in my garage
in the mancave i also have a small refrigerator
each time the compressor would kick offit cause my system to lose video video runs though a yamaha av receiver
i purchased this hoping it would solvethe problem it did not
the solution was to change the socket that the refrigerator plugs in to
i had to pay an electrician to change the socket the refrigerator plug in to to the garage circuit rather than the mancave circuit
now the problemis completely gone
i though this unit might do the trick and it helped some but didnt totally fix the problem as it would stilllose video some when the refrigerator compressor kicked ofnow that ive swapped the outlet circuit for the refrigeratorby hiring the electrician the problem is resolved
so its an ok unit for level out voltages but thats really all it does and ifyou want real filtering look elsewherethese may not be the best in noise reduction headphones but the sound is better than average and the construction is sturdy and well builtno cheap plastic parts that break these have mostly metal parts
it has a long study cord and builtin volumn control and a dual mode switch on the cord for stereo or mono
for the money these are a good buyi would recommend them for general usei bought these for a nascar race and they worked great
they are straightforward fit well and had a nice volume knob and monostereo switch built in
theyre not light but i wore them for nearly  hours straight with no issues
the audio is decent but theres absolutely no bass so i wouldnt recommend these for anything but loud situations with just voices rather than musicgot these for my kids that went to their first nascar race recently
we did use a  way splitter so not sure if that affected anything but my old koss and these new ones all worked well
when the cars were right in front of us we couldnt hear the scanner but thats kinda what you have to expect
i like that you dont have to pump these full of batteries to make them work like other noise reduction onesi bought these qzs to use in my shop
i have a stereo down there but of course when the dust collector chip collector and table saw are all running you definitly cannot listen to music
ive been using ear buds with my normal headset over themto listen to my ipod worked ok but had to keep the volume fairly high even then
these noise reduction headphones are just the ticket
have used them almost every day for a week or so and am very pleased with their performance
even the loudest machine in my shop planer is just background noise and doesnt interfer with the music
i am able to listen at a much lower volume and find myself only cranking it up for real favorites that have to be listened to at head rattling volume
i used em at the range today and they did a better job than the muffs i usually wear while shooting
and my shooting headset cost a lot more than these did
all things considered these are a great set of headphones and the lifetime warrenty is just icing on the cake
highly recommendi wanted a pair of headphones that didnt require batteries and would let me mow the lawn in peacelets be frank here
these are not meant for high end music satisfaction
they are a pair of noise reduction ear muffs with speakers in themi can listen to my audio books while mowing and weed eating the lawn
they work better than my other active battery powered ones
i dont even have to turn my ipod up to full volumei took off one star for one reason
the little slip locking washer on the frame that attaches the ear pieces to the frame are metal
they are a little loose and that means there is a metal washer on a metal frame
it can rattle
if you shake your head a bit you can notice itbut i just wanted to listen to my books while mowing the lawn which they are great for
i also just completed a project using a lot of different power tools
it was nice working with them in relative quietthese cut out most of the annoying noise of the lawn mower and i can listen to music
the earphones are comfortable over  min
they tend to be tight around the ears but you can loosen the tension somewhat
i have sound reducing earphones that are better for the airplane but not useful with the lawn mowervery good sound 
i use this when metal detecting and well worth the money
the only problem i have is that the cord is very long and gets in the way sometimes but really no big problemits a nice watch but the band is a bit flimsy and the controls are not very fluid from you would expect from suunto
the ad actually stated there was a temperature guage but it seems that there is not one
notwithstanding this confusion whoseever it may be this a good watch but doesnt have all the bells and whistles i expected
i was looking for a solid computer meeting a rugged watchthis is the watch that put suunto on the map in  its been to the top of mt
everestpros mountaineers hikers climbers will enjoy the triple sensor altitude temperature compass features
very lightweight and surprisingly comfortable
trendy large diameter size
super easy to read display
worn by the members of televisions stargate sg and stargate atlantiscons el backlight requires holding upper right button for  seconds to activate
kind of thick and bulky at mm
water resistance sketchy
mariners divers sailors need not apply
kind of old news
casio now sells similar but possibly more fashionable pathfinder and protrek modelsvery good product just want the light is stronger in the night but it works just fine orienting myself in height which is very important for my job i have more than  years and still working greatthis may be the outdoorsy ubergeek watch
its big its ugly but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy
overall i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they arethe timepiece outstanding
it has hhmmss ddmmm of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues
this should go without saying in a modern digital watch
stopwatch with lap function not that i ever use the lap function but im sure someone is interested
countdown timer that can run up to a  hour countdown very easy to set
three daily alarms
special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms ive heard and ive missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate thisthe altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat
over four days my bedroom went from m above sea level to  m below sea level by the maps about m asl
not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and i never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you wantneed itthe barometer yup its a barometer
the part i like is the little display that shows the risingfalling trend especially as this is always active even in normal time modethe thermometer take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wristthe compass easily the best special feature
accurate precise enough for orienteering not for surveying easy to use
it can be programmed for a declination but knowing me id forget to reset it so i do declination the hard way
the sighting notches are small but servicable
the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass
an outstanding wrist compassthe package big
really really big
but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing a problem for me with other watches
the battery has a shortish  month life but has a hatch so you dont need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance
the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight
personally im going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap isnt bad just not greatoverall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter
well designed thoughtout and manufactured but really bigto my way of thinking there are only two factors which keep the vector from receiving a full stars here
 is the watch face
it is not very durable
it isnt even glass
its made out of very easily scratched plastic
i own several watches and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat but this one takes it to a whole new level
id be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to  meters ie  feet this watch isntfar from it
you are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone else is taking a hot shower
the humidity alone may cause problems
pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtubnow with that said if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can the vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas
itll tell you the temperature under the right circumstances of course help you predict the weather give you a bearing on where you need to go and then after proper adjusting tell you your altitude
i found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate  oh and those reviews i have read onandoff by folks bragging about telling the altitude inside of a pressurized passenger plane are bogusconsidering what this watch can do and its limitations i believe that the price is a bit high you can buy a casio watch thatll do the same thingand is solarpowered and is really waterresistent all for less but the vector has one thing that not all suunto watches or altimeterbarometercompass watches come with that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings
if casio adds one to their model ill probably become a fulltime convert
if you are looking for something similar but smaller try looking at the suunto observer
its a danggoodlooking watch but the price is considerably more so that may be a rather important factor for you i know it is for meall in all suunto makes great products but water resistent models are unfortunately not one of them unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater useive owned the suunto vector for more than three years after purchasing it when i first became interested in adventure racing
while many top racers wear it i would highly recommend it for the serious hiker climber or backcountry skier for its solid construction design and versatilitywhile i also wear this as my everyday watch its extra large size should be taken into consideration if thats something you have in mindthere are a couple other brands available in this market segment but the relatively low price and exceptional feature set are what continues to set this tool apart from the crowdheres what you should know expect to replace the battery at least once a year
this is due to a number of reasons one of which is the powerful backlight on the face that when activated can nearly illuminate the inside of a small tent at night
if you believe the manufacturers warnings and want to play it safe you may want to have this procedure performed by a professional watch not outdoor shop
suunto sells a battery pack that comes with a replacement seal and screwin back and this is definitely something to consider every other replacement opportunity but you can get by with a lowercost duracell type  v lithium if youre on a budget
 the altimeter is one of the strongest features allowing you to quickly pinpoint your location on a topo map
however plan to reset it regularly especially after a plane ride or frequent and significant changes in altitude or weather
this is rather easy as along as you have a confirmed location metric but you have to remember to do it regularly to ensure the greatest accuracy
the hour memory provides a total measurement of your ups and downs ascents and descents over that time period a really cool record for runners mountain bikers and skiers
 the compass is one of the strongest in this class of devices which to be sure isnt the greatest to begin with  but even the serious orienteerer would be impressed
the ability to adjust for local declination is really nice
 the barometer is good but not great
however if you want to be aware of potential weather changes this will provide you with some peace of mind
better to be safe than sorry or worse in this regard
 the thermometer isnt accurate at all unless you take the watch off for  minutes or so to eliminate the warming effect of your skinbody temperature
 some of the controls and settings are not easy to comprehend or remember
ive never been able to figure out how to use the stopwatch timer and lap features
if youre a swimmer or triathlete and this is important to you look to the timex ironman standby
 waterproofing is rock solid
no worries
 the softrubber watchband is comfortable to wear but will deteriorate over time even more rapidly in chlorine
suunto offers a much lighter nylonvelcro alternative that i personally preferoverall i really like the vector
but for a number of reasons already mentioned would not feel comfortable giving it a perfect  score
but consider my  more like a   you cant go wrong hereive bought this one and works perfectly but ive changed it for a xlander with aluminium case wich one is perfectbought this for my husband
its a great looking watch
i love the color
i wish it came in a smaller size for small wrists or a womans version for methis sleeve is not for ibooks
its for quot screen laptop computers and swims on my quot powerbook
maybe its ok for a quot ibook but not a quot ibook or powerbook as the other review suggestsdecent product great price
i have  laptop is really too big but happy with value of the product
would buy againits a simple sleeve to hold your notebook i use this and a padded tucano bag to protect the notebook the only minor gripe is that it has grown hair in certain psrts as the material got scraped when taking the notebook in and outit is not the prettiest of sleeves
nor is it the most expensive of sleeves
but it does its job
my  widescreen notebook fits inside fine  there is still a little room around but not much  it does not fit like a glove though
it is really nice that the zipper tab can be buttoned down
i use this sleeve to protect my notebook inside my timbuk bag when i have to lug around my notebookworks great once internet connection problem cleared up
had to get help from my provider verizon dsl who was very helpful
would recomment this for anyone who needs more that four access portswell the rvseries from linksys has spoiled me and given me higher expectations that i should have for their standardissue products
this is a quirky little device
doesnt have much competition in the router world except for its big brothers the rv and rv which i highly recommend btw
anyway it seems to work wonderfully until i try to change the port for remote administration
i use one in the high range above  which some tcpip guru would probably say is wrong
anyway any other router that allows me to put in my own custom port value has worked fine but changing the ra port on this one makes it not work has to be reset to defaults and then reprogrammed
still if you just leave that alone the rest of the features seem to work fine
at  the price it certainly is more affordable than the rv
the one place i use these is an office building where  nonprofits all share office space and a tiny communications closet stuffed with wires
this cuts the number of devices in half by combining the router and a bigenough switch into one unit
also its easy on their budgets
the new models come with the nice small power brick that seems to use less power and generate less heat
if you need performancereliability and can afford it get the rv instead
if youre trying to fit a onepiece solution into a home structuredwiring cabinet then this is a better choice because of less heat output and smaller footprintthe card woks great with my di router
the only problem that i have is after my laptop goes into standby i have to reboot to get back on the networkjust a few min
to set it up to work with my netgear mr wireless router on the second floor
excellent connection anywhere inside my two story home
i tested outside my home
when the connection became lost i moved closer to the router but the connection wouldnt back on automatically
i need to pull and insert card again in order to have it connected again
not sure this is common problem
no experience with other cards as this is my first onelisten herea lot of people are complaining that the card doesnt work at all
if youre using pcmcia type ii of course not
this is a  bit cardbusseen on newer laptops
that means if your laptop doesnt support this protocol of course it isnt going to worka lot of people are saying that it doesnt work with windows xp
thats funny because when i put it in the slot with the dlink cd in the drive xp installed it configured it and i was on the internet immediately before i knew what was going ona lot of people say it overheats
so did my ghz p laptop but my ghz p doesnt
maybe you need to check your cooling apparatii in your laptopa lot of people say its range is bad
i live in a two story house and the router is located in the garage
my room is directly above the room and even through floors the signal is strong enough and this is directly next to a  ghz cordless with a microwave in the other room
so i dont know what you guys are talking abouta lot of people say they are having trouble getting it to configure and install correctly
i did at first  but the trick is if you change anything drivers etc it may kick the wireless out of sync
the fix
deinstall the driver and reinstall it
itll work like a charmbottom line  im a computer nerd but this is my first wireless networking attempt and im overall happy with it
i think im going to do this from now on instead of running cat cabling all over the place
i bought a newer laptop just to take full advantage of this and so far i am not disappointed in the slightestive had a minolta slr for the past  years and been very happy with it but after buying the my other half a canon digital elph i found the ability to immediately review photographs compelling
so i looked for a digital slrolympus has hit the priceperformance sweet spot with this camera
competitive digital slrs cost  more than the e for the body alone  ie
before youve bought any lenses
however i was concerned that the e would be an adequate replacement for my film slr
so the e passed with flying colorswhats good about this camera terrific image quality great lens ff
 all the control you could want white balance focus zoom exposure flash support for compact flash and smart media and ability to take up to  shots in rapid succession easy upload of images to a pc adobe photoshop le included and good battery life on olympus nimh aa batteriesi took scores of pictures every day and was generally pleased with the results
the camera functions well in program mode but immediate image review on the camera enables you to use more control if you dont get the shot you need
and with digital you can just keep on taking shots until you get it right without worrying about filmthe ability to take  shots in rapid succession is useful when trying to capture spontaneous events  like the procession of flag throwers a tuscan tradition that goes back over  years out for a practice early one sunday in siena
other digital cameras have big problems with both shutter lag time from pressing the button to capturing the image and the interval between shots  especially with a  megapixel ccd where images take longer to write to flashi made extensive use of a polarizing filter to cut glare under the tuscan sun and the images came out with strong colors as a result
the e seems a little flatter in its color balance than canon cameras but color saturation can be easily tweaked in photoshop if this is a problem for any given imagei never managed to run the olympus aa nimh batteries purchased separately flat during a days shooting so camera power consumption seems to be excellent  short battery life is a killer for many digital camerasthe lens is very impressive
it has a great zoom range and as the camera was designed for digital from the ground up there are none of the multiplying effects of film cameras converted for digital use eg
canon d
this means that the e has great shortrange capability as well as telephoto without having to switch lenses
this is very important if you want to travel light as i didwhats notsogood problems with ibm microdrive autofocus requires care to avoid misfocus errors viewfinder image location leads to orientation errors general operation could be a lot faster and the optional olypus case is poorthe e requires the photographer to carefully monitor whether it has successfully locked on the subject
early on i got several poorly focused shots because the af didnt focus on the subject
its easy to miss this in the viewfinder or on the lcd image preview  you only find out when you get home however once you learn to watch for mistaken af lock it is possible to refocus and avoid this
still after minoltas exemplary af system this was an unpleasant surprisei also used an ibm microdrive with my e but discovered that it does not work properly
i would be able to take several photographs and then the camera would suddenly complain of flash card errors
its easy to miss candid shots when youre wondering why the camera isnt working then realizing theres a flash error switching to smart media so the microdrive went back
get a mb flash card insteadthe viewfinder image is large and oddly focused  its easy to tilt the camera about a degree and not notice  until you get to image review
this can be fixed in photoshop but its annoying to have to fix itfinally the olympus feels slower than many pointnshoot cameras and this is likely down to the embedded processor used in the camera
it takes several seconds before an image can be previewed and it is slow to move around in image preview mode
also it seems to take a long time to compress an image and store it to flash
the  image buffer dramatically reduces the impact of this but not entirely  especially when you want to take one photo and see how it came out straight awayfinally dont buy olympus case for the e
it is very cumbersome and youll end up wishing you never brought it
i left it at home or in the car most days
you cant open up the case and leave it hanging off the camera  it gets in your way
that means you have to totally remove the camera from the case and either put it down stuff it in a bag or squash it under your arm while you try to take photographsthe net is that i cant see why id go back to a film slr
although the olympus e has its quirks and microdrive incompatibility is a drawback it is a very good digital camera at an excellent price point for the value you receive
olympus really doesnt have any competition for the moneysimply put this camera is a solid machine that offers excellent image quality as well as photographic control
being an slr i never used the lcd screen to shoot which makes it more like using a standard mm
get the battery packgrip
without it the consumption of batteries is tremendous
with it i easily got  shots before needing a recharge
my major gripe and the reason i upgraded to a canon eos d is that it is slow
the buffer is inadequate and i always found myself waiting for it to empty to take another shot
viewing the images on the lcd screen takes forever
and the top shutter speed of  second is not fast enoughive read some of the memorex  reviews and conclude that the ones having trouble have either the initial release of the player no suffix a to indicate the firmware revision somewhat quirky cd burning or both
its probably mostly the memorex player fault
our suffix a revision has been used all week with mostly  kbps mps and has worked fine
the controls arent hard
its more like a button button whos got the button kind of annoyance
after all they are mostly for search which most of the alternative players cant even do
anyway get the latest revision and you should be happy like we aresanta left one of these players under the tree for me this year and so far it has behaved very well
overall i am pretty pleased with it especially given that it came with kit componentsim slightly disappointed by the fact that the player always plays mp tracks in alphabetical order for a given folder not counting when its set to random so when i listen to a folder with tracks from a symphony or soundtrack they dont play in the order they were rippedof course i could append a track number to the name of the file before burning mp cds but id prefer to be able to set the player to process by file creation date ie track order as ripped or alphabeticallyive sent email to memorexs customer support with this question so well see what they sayfor the price that i got under  it was a very nice unit
ive had the unit for over six months now and so far only some skipping occur but not much at all
the skippings usually seem quite random and doesnt happen because th eunit is being moved or anything like that
the unit i have contians the suffix a stickerthe car kit that came with mine though is a little weird
at times the volume will be too soft for no reason but mostly they all worked greatthe only things i really dont like about this unit are  the display lcd isnt backlit making reading practically impossible at night and  the search option is not very user friendly and the unit doesnt seem to respond too well to itover all i give it  stars for its price and that it hadnt died on me yetthis is my first dvd player and i only was able to get it because i could afford this one
i have had it almost a year and am quite satisfied with the purchase
if you occasionally unplug it for a day the software resets and it works fine
i learned this from tech support which was helpful and available
is it the greatest dvd player
probably not but for less than  clams it is good enough
it is infinitely superior to a vcr and not much more expensive
using a good dvd player cleaner occasionally also helps
since i hooked it up so that there is no electricity to it when it is off i have had fewer problems
it is constantly resetting the software and avoiding those messy glitchesi just bought one for my daughter for christmasi have had the oritron dvd for about  days
with only one exception it has worked very well on the all of the dvd rentals and titles i have bought
at first i did experience the variations of light and dark picture especially on meet the parents that others have mentioned but it went away when i connected it directly to the television and not through the vcr
the sound is very good if not greatone problem i have had that i havent seen mentioned elsewhere is that the player defaults to a french soundtrack if that option is available on the menu if you do not actually select english before starting the movie
this is more an annoyance than a major problem since i knew it was an inexpensive machine going in and expected some bugs
but one movie i bought john boormans excalibur will not play in english no matter what
in fact after a few minutes of trying you cannot even access the menu on this dvd
this is the only title so far that has had this problem  the disc worked fine on a friends machine so i know its not the dvd
i have not tried the disney discs that some others have had problems withother than this i have been pleased with its operation and have enjoyed many hours of viewing with no distractions from the player
i have been watching the monty pythons flying circus complete series box set which cost more than the player
and have had no problems navigating through the many special features
i will probably get a more expensive machine in the future but i think this was a great way to initially get into the world of dvdi purchased the oritron dvd as a second player and it works great no problems
i read the reviews listed here and was skeptical about the product however for the price i took a chance and have been very pleased
maybe the products early release had the bugs and have since fixed the problem
i dunno but once again give it a try i have been pleased and plan to buy another for a christmas present
oh one other thing i had read people could not play disney dvds well mine plays all disney dvds i have including the dinosoar dvd and has not had a problem on any dvd i have watched which is about  so far this is what makes me think the newer product is a better productabout a year ago i felt it was time for me to upgrade to dvdsfinally but i still couldnt afford those highend players so i settled for this one
a year later and not only is it still working fine but until this one breaks i dont even feel the urge to buy a new one
from personal experience only i havent run into any problems with my playerok except to figure out how to use the parental control optionbut thats either my fault or the manuals not the player itself and factoring price and functionalityneeds direct hook up with tv picture is terrible running through your vcr am very satisfied with it
only sore point is it doesnt play vcdsbut it doesnt say it will either
i feel badly for other reviewers who have had problems with it and in their cases im sure it let them down
in my case i can only say its still with me still in use on a regular basisi sometimes review dvds at amazoncom and this is the player i use to watch them and am pleased i bought it
so if youre looking for that second player that first budget player or just require something that will let you watch dvds i can recommend this one
having said that id like to point out its a year later and you could find lowend players for as low as sixty bucks
plus you can get some highend dvd players or dvdvcr combos for around two hundred
so shop around for the best pricesedit i was looking at my reviews to see which i should delete and i was surprised this one is still up
well its august  and my crazy oritron is still working
its my first dvd player ever got regular usage and its still working
im sad it let down so many others with the apparent star average
i mustve gotten one of the few good ones
btw i forgot to mention  yrs ago this dvd player has the ability to keep track of where you left offstopped in your last  dvds
very cool feature back in the dayand i didnt even bother to put it in my review
of course its  and dvds players and blurays are everywhere
but i have to say i think this dvd player is great stars for a cheapo dvd playerwell it would be if it didnt rarely overheat
for a cheapo this machine is great
search the web to really unlock this machines secret powersthis is not a dvd player for someone with a massive home theatre  its missing many advanced features
its great for occasional use and even low and midrange theatres
its international features make it a great secondary player even for big theatres toogeneral opinion of camerai am a gadget guy
i use this camera more than i was using my old  mm autofocus camera
i like being able to snap pics and email them right away
the quality is good enough for the internet and it is fun for my  year old to use
for people who are perfectionists dont get this camera
save your money and spend the extra hundreds for a  megapixel with an optical zoom
i however am having fun taking pics around work and on the weekends and rushing home to edit them in photoshop
if you like gadgets and want to get in on digital photography and dont have much money i recommend the camerathis is an autofocus camera and as with all such cameras you have to tinker with the focus to make sure your subject is focused right
it just takes a bit of practicethe digital zoom is a waste of time
dont get excited
you get the same effect by taking the pic regular and then zooming in photoshop later
but the macro is cool
i have gotten some cool closeup shots with itthe quality of the pics seems to be the same as with a normal filmbased camera as far as color and exposure stuffa lot of people have said the batteries get terrible life
this is not my experience
i have found that if i keep the camera off unless i am using it as well as not using the lcd except for quick peeks at important shots to make sure things are okay i can get many many pics of a set off batteries in superfine mode
i am on around  total pics so far and on my third set of aa duracell ultras
some have said that rechargeables work and others have reported their ccd getting fried
i am not taking a chance
one more thing when the camera is done with the batteries and cant take a pic the batteries still have power and are worth holding on to for extras for flashlights radios etc dont just chuck themissuesyou definitely do get a parallax issue with the camera in certain situations what you see in the viewfinder is not what the pic ends up being
this is not a big deal and is the same with all non slr cameras
i have just gotten used to the tendency of the camera and compensate for itthe biggest design flaw is the onoff switch
it is way too easy to flip on
i am sure my batteries would last even longer if the off switch were to stay offthe second biggest flaw is that there is nothing protecting the lens
well the lens is behind a plastic clear covering but still you scratch the plastic coveringthats it you are screwedtips for newbies considering buying this camerait is really important for those thinking of getting any digital camera to understand that you need to get extras that cost you more than you are expecting you need to get a compact flash card with much bigger memory because the pictures are usually not going to make you happy unless you are using the superfine mode and when you are using the superfine mode you can only get around  pictures on the included mb card you need to get an ac adapter to use whenever possible to spare your batteries
you should use the ac adapter when transferring pics to your computer unless you buy a sandisk or similar card reader see below instead
also you need the ac adapter to use when reviewing your pics on an lcd when possible or when inside so you can snap away with flash and not burn your batteries you need to get a compact flash reader like sandisk
i use sandisk
i prefer this to the included software because i can just drag the pics to my pic folder very quickly and open them up in protoshop for processing
it is much simpler than having to hook the usb up to the camera and it saves your batteriesall this stuff will end up costing you extra bucks
this is not considering costs for glossy photo paper and the like or the batteries i must admit i was very happy with the results i got from the first set of batteries
the regular gripe is there it eats batteries for snack
dont ask what it would do for dinner i am using nimh rechargeable batteries without any  problem so far
but since the rechargeable batteries are  volt instead of  for regularthe camera takes a bit of time before actually releasing the shutter
and i am pretty annoyed of the fact that the camera charges the flash each time it is turned on
even when it is bright day light
whats up with that
i wish the charging was dependent on the existing lightin summary great camera for the price
quite happy with ita lens cover would be great thoughthis camera came bundled with an hp printer purchased from walmart aboutoh or  years ago when i was stationed in hawaii
it was a great upgrade from our submegapixel camera that had just broken
i cant even remember the size of the card that came with it but upgraded to a gb flash card
the amount of mp pics you can take are endless
the printer stunk and i gave it away as soon as the ink cartridges ran out but the camera stayed and i still have it todayheres the meat pros and consprosit takes excellent pictures
the pictures we were taking from hawaii actually spawned an hp digital camera revolution amongst my family
they went out and bought a few high quality hp cameras much better than this oneit can take a lickin and keeps onworking
ive dropped it my wife has dropped my daughter has dropped it the batteries will pop out but we stick them back in and it works
dropping it on concrete gave the thing a few scuffs thoughease of use
turn it on and its a no brainer
you dont need a stinkin manual for this oneit has a viewfinder
nice feature to have when its sunny or youre trying to preserve battery powerconsbulky
its bigger than my gb camcorder
it wasnt cute enough for my wife so i had to by her a coolpixbattery
it takes sooooo many batteries   aas
thats a bunch
and it goes through them quicker than a alcoholic through a pack of budhawaii was sunny which meant that we couldnt see the lcd display most of the time
we used the view finder a lotcharge time to next picture
yes its slow
missed a lot of shots waiting for the thing to get ready for the next available picture optipsive never had an issue taking an action shot
i found that if i depressed the shoot button half way to initiate the focus and simply followed what ever it was that was moving then depressed the button all the way for the instant shot it would always take a clear shot
this trick seems to work on many digital cameras that have issues with action shotsoveralltheres way better cameras out there now
this was over  years ago
technology has advanced far enough now that you can afford a camera much cheaper than this with better quality and a higher mega pixel shot
but at that time it was a great addition to our family and is still occasionally used to this day when i scrape up a handful of aa batteriesthis camera was another one of those gifts i couldnt use because i wouldnt upgrade from windows  and truth be told i just liked film so the little camera found its way into the closet however when i upgraded to anapple imac g desktop with  mlla  ghz powerpc g  mb ram  gb hard drive dvdcdrw drivelast summer i hooked it up and was very impressed with the results ive included six examples in the share a photo section all were taken with the fine photo quality setting x resolution
a basic x and superfine x are also available
be sure to get a case to protect your camera the best one ive seen is thehp photosmart padded hip pouch for use with hp photosmart digital cameras   this is a beginners camera that was outdated years ago yet it takes pictures that are more clear and colorful than any comparable digital camera ive compared it to including a few new cameras that are supposed to be marketed at more discerning customers
a friend of mine with a new and more capable camera was actually a bit miffed when he compared the results of our impromptu comparison test
i used it for ebay and got fantastic results
ive also used it to print photos on ahp photosmart  photo printerand got very good results as wellive been using this camera for almost a year now and it has weathered over  miles of driving bad roads getting tossed into bags then carried into hotels so long as i am reasonably careful its tough but not built like a tank
the only objection ive had is a problem taking pictures of a very fast airplane that was powered by a rocket engine and i managed to get a few ok pics of the plane anyway
for the tiny price you pay to get an hp  today plus the very inexpensive memory cards it uses this is a fantastic starter camerai just bought this camera today and so far it is the simpleist one i have ever saw to use
i have not printed anything from it yet but it should be great
i do not know why some people have said that you cant turn off the auto focus because you can it is the button on the top next to the flash symbolthe battery issue is the only thing that worries mei have looked for an affordable digital camera for some time now and this is it most  mp cameras are well over  and  mp cameras are mostly  this one will do till i can afford to get one of themdelivery was prompt and the price was reasonable
our family has been through several pairs of binoculars
having kids and grandkids has been rough on binoculars no matter how careful they may try to be
if these get dropped we will not feel  devastated because they are not that expensive
the wide field of view for x is ideal for the rural area we live in
the focus is easy with or without glasses and the image is sharp
there is no color distortion as you see with some binoculars
we were not impressed with the lens caps which are pretty loose but we dont normally use them anyway
these binoculars  are big and not as portable as the xs but thats understandable for xs
i have looked at the moon and some stars although i had to to prop them to get a steady view
if you plan to carry your binoculars  for long walks you might want to get something a little smaller but for us these are perfectthis is fixed x  not a zoom
didnt realize that when i bought even so it works fine for the price
using this in the suburbs i was able to see albeit faintly the andromeda galaxy and the orion nebula
i cant wait to try out somewhere in the countryside these are useful but of course now i am left wanting morei bought a pair of these on sale from my gold box  x is supposed to be the ideal for stargazing
i figured that this might come at the price of some chromatic distortion tolerable or difficulty focusing intolerable
last night was a clear night here in the south bay
i live about a mile inland on the coastal edge of los angeles vast light pollution
no marine layer and i quickly pulled the full moon into focus then adjusted the other eyepiece
they work for me but if my eyes get much worse  ill have to pass them on to somebody youngerenough of the moon already
i wanna see something i dont see on a regular basis
a quick scan of orion showed some nebulosity visible even above city lights
they feel steady
im looking forward to more star timei didnt notice any chromatic aberation
i have only three minor complaints no tripod socket for making sure that kids can see what you want them too see
no socket was promised  so this is not a really fair complaint lens caps are cheap and tend to fall off
watch out for them
it wouldnt have cost that much more to manufacture better lens capsbushnell ought to fix this one i would have designed the adjustable lens with a broader range of diopters for those of us who dont quite see as well as we used toall in all a great pear of binocs for searching the night skythese binoculars are very good for the money
the  power is a little hard to steady but that is not the binoculars fault
focusing is easy and straightforward especially for those who wear glasses
the rubber protective covers are a little loose but i would buy this same item againi am an amateur astronomer and this binoculars get the job done letting you make a non deep observation of the sky at nightits pretty easy to focus on this ones and easy to get them out of focusthey include the binoculars obviously with their protective caps a not very soft cleaning cloth a string for hang them and a bag for carryingthe only complain i have is that after a while they feel slightly heavy but could be because i point them up to the sky in a tiring mannerthese are about the strongest binoculars that can be easily held to view images at a distance without having difficulty holding it steady
the tab type focus mech is ok but not great
there is slop in it versus the old fashioned screw adjusment type
you push down on one side of the tab or the other and the binoculars dont immediately start to focus as they do with the screw type adjusmentsthe binoculars work great in almost any viewing conditions
only draw back is the protective caps come off way to easily which can cause the to be lost
very durable and well made
great itemthe only gripe that i have with them is the lens cups just dont fit
they sit on the lens so when you lift the binoculars they just fall off
i had to line each cup with electrical tape to make them lush onto the lens
hopefully that will work in the longterm
one function that i particularly liked is the ease of focusing
rather than turning a wheel between the lenses there is a triangular block
you simply move this slightly to bring the object into sharp focus
i like also that the lenses are wide and brighti didnt know much about binoculars and mainly bought these because of the price and generally high reviews
they work well over distances beyond  feet or so and though they dont really feature anything special focus is controlled two ways by a ring and a lever in the middle they do their job pretty well
as others have noted you can sharpen up things even over long distances  last night i looked at a few planes overhead and even the moon itself where i could see sharplydefined craters and the rough outline of the suns reflection across the outer rim of the dark side it was a  moon
this morning i was able to see cars going up a hill to a school in the distance and the image was very clear
i mainly bought these for an upcoming alaskan cruise trip so hopefully theyll work well in spotting whalesthe only negatives are the slightly loose eyepiece caps and the awkward strap which should have been longer and had a padded part for your shoulderneck
the binoculars arent very heavy but its awkward having them hang on your sideexcellent pair got it while in kenya and i could tell you it was all need it for
i could spot animals at a pretty good distances
i am very happy with product and the price is awesome
recommended
only con is the size a bit  bulkynicethese are a fine inexpensive pair of binoculars
i live on a beach and they are good for watching the occasional whale or shark that wanders by
good magnification great wide angle
their immediate focus rocker works well and they dont break the banki use these for stargazing
crisp images thanks partially to the nifty focus mechanism
these are a good cheap starting point for amateur astronomy  x is pretty much the standard magnificationexit pupil for the purposethe biggest con is the horrible lens caps
theyre obnoxiously cheap and barely stay on while the binoculars themselves have excellent optics and generally look and feel good the lens caps arent much good for anything except wedging under a wobbly tablei recently purchased these binoculars to take to the arizona diamondbacks home game
they are light weight and easy to use
i would recommend them to anyone
the only draw back was when we tried to view the stars and the moon they were very difficult to hold steady
i paid a whopping twentyfive dollars plus shipping and thats alot of bang for my buckfirst a note on switches vs hubs
a hub shares the bandwith between connected devices
so if you have one computer going through the hub to the internet and a second connecting to a third over the lan for a file transfer they have at most mbs total between them
a switch actually routes a dedicated connection for each pair of communicating devices so that they can communicate at full bandwidth
if youve already got a switch you might want to consider the somewhat less expensive rt which is the routerfirewall without the switch
if you have a hub on the other hand id suggest going with the  instead the hub can still be used to allow your network to grow beyond  devices after all two computers a laptop and a network printer and youre tapped out with the  on its ownanyway this is a great device
i pulled it out of the box plugged in the wires and everything worked immediately
im sharing cable internet between a windows  box and powermac running os and dave  with no problems at allits  stars because the web interface is really quite useless
to properly configure this device including the very cool dynamic dns capabilities you need to telnet to the box
not a big deal but still a minor nuisance
theres no reason the web interface couldnt handle these other configuration options as welli had considered the linksys box which is very similar in capabilities but searching usenet archives revealed that the netgear is a much more reliable devicei looked at both the linksys  port cable router and the netgear rt
i have friends that own the linksys and they work well but i was a little turned off by the plastic look and feel of that unitthe netgear rt has a rugged metal case and feels more like a commercial router than a home unit
the netgear also includes the cat connector cable in the boxwhich is not a huge deal but is a nice additionthe software and instructions that come with the unit are somewhat minimal but i found the setup pretty straightforward  and im not a trained network person
i wanted to be able to run two computers off the same cable connection and this router lets me do that with a couple of added benefits
my connection is actually faster than without the router and i have the security of a firewall
i had planned to buy firewall software but for a little more money i get the router firewall and port switch all in one slick unitthe one thing that i wish were different is the power adapter
the one that comes with the linksys unit has a grounded plug while the netgear comes with a twopronged block power adapter
luckily i had room for the block but i would feel more comfortable having the unit groundedall in all the rt works beautifullyi use my old nikon  all of the time
so i find that i have to buy new rechargeable batteries every few years because they seem to lose the ability to retain a charge for longer periods the more they are rechargedorder received in good time  no problemsbattery lifetimes are short  not as good as firstoriginal from dealer but twice as good as poorerchoice batteries from other suppliersnikon  can take a lot of pictures using this battery  time i buy itits probably just my perception but these batteries just dont seem to last that long for the amount of use i give them
it doesnt help that my cooplix  eats them like candy fortunately it is now my backup point and shoot to my real camera but i have to have  of these in rotation for any serious shooting or travel fun
if you have a batterygobbler like mine youre probably better off with a cheaper nikonknockoff battery but i honestly dont know all the issues
best to ignore this reviewnothing to see herethe drive is the oem version rwa of popular ricohmet mpa
the drive works very well even with the cheaper media available on the market ive tried ritek and cmc manufactured cheapies
as with other ide burners without the new burnproof option care should be taken on multitasking while cd is being burned to avoid buffer underruns
the real plus of this burner is the dae digital audio extraction capability
it is able to rip audio tracks at average speed of x min x max x
so if you are into creating mp files this drive is for you
although there are faster drives on the market this is very nice drive for the pricethis lens works exactly as expected sharp corner to corner wide open as sharp as the   zooms
almost no vignetting wide open completely gone by f
ca is minor correctable incamera in the d mark iii or in raw
relatively light weight and small compared to the  f zooms
lquality build and optics
if you use the  f mostly at  this is a cheaper alternativeall that said im not keeping it
i find that image stabilization is an absolute must at anything over mm on todays high resolution sensor cameras
i check each shot for camera motion blur and if its there the photo is not perfect
even at f handholding this lens is out of the question in existing indoor lighting
i tried getting blurfree shots in a bright room and its nearly impossible without going up into noisy isos
on a tripod its great
todays  f lenses have is as does the mm macro l all the telephoto lenses longer than  and even the mm and mm lenses got a makeover with is 
an is version of this lens would make sensea better option buy the  f l is instead
heres why optically its just as good at mm
size and weight are similar
you get the versatility of mm zoom
ergonomics are better
four stops of image stabilizationyou lose one stop of light but you gain  stops of handholdability a net gain of three stops
and you can shoot handheld down to  secondthis indeed is a fine lens
excellent construction
relatively small and discreet with the lens hood off
excellent image quality and very sharp
the colors it produces are gorgeous  it may be a subjective thing but to me it has that certain look that you get from some of the finest l lenses
if you buy it you will be very pleasedthe one negative thing i can say about the lens is that it has less than stellar flare control
more than my other lenses this lens is susceptible to washed out images if the sun is in the wrong spot
it is at times frustrating if you cant work around
it is a bit of an issue but i wouldnt consider it serious enough that you should avoid this lens for this reason
i would give this lens a   stars but amazon forces me to take off a whole staronce microadjusted on you camera it is very sharp
i used this thing on both d mark ii and rebel ti
i found that on ti while creating beautiful images it was always slightly out of focus evident only when you pixel peeped
on the d mk ii on the other hand it is perfect but as i said had to be adjusted
i suspect that my copy needs to be calibrated
make sure that you test it out if you dont the option to adjust in your camera
this issue can be easily fixed on the d mk iii dont think it is fair to reduce the rating because the lens a prime or that it is not a zoom and therefore not as versatile
thats the type of lens that it is
if it doesnt suit you dont buy it
while primes have much better iq than zooms i understand that is not the case when it comes to canon l tele zooms such as   ii
in terms of iq there would be no advantage to getting this prime
however the pros of the l prime is that it is much smaller its black and more discreet and significantly cheaperlack of is is not really an issue on a full frame camera where you can crank up the iso a bit in lower light situations
at  this lens is reasonably fast to shoot hand held in daylight
ive used it hand held indoors where there was a lot of light and i had no issues whatsoeverthis lens is quite versatile
its wonderful for portrait and landscape photography
it would make a great sports lens i suppose but ive never used it for that purpose
if you have kids this will probably be your go to lens
i doubt that this lens is suitable for wildlife as it just doesnt reach far enough for that purposei have one final suggestion to those contemplating purchasing this lens
i find that i love owning the lens but i use it the least
consider if you need this focal length
if your longest lens is a mm or mm you may find that a mm or mm is a more versatile focal lengtha couple of years ago i had my  f  stolen
at the time i chose not to replace it its heavy and i do mostly architecture and landscapes
i figure i used it for less that  of all shots
well recently i decided i needed something in the moderate telephoto range
i still did not want to pay  for a lens that i would hardly use because of its weight and focal length
i realised that most the the time with the  i used it at  not at   or  so i opted to buy this much lighter prime
its much lighter than the  lenses even the f lens it has supurb iq
the only drawback the af is a tad noisy compared to the  flfor the price it offers supurb iq even when coupled with a tc its very light and its not obvious i have had difficulties in the past with the white lenses as people assume you are a pro and may not let you take phtotos without credentialsi am a hobbyist and only comment as one here  this is the best lens ive used so far as far as iq goes
on top its light weight discreet not too expensive
somehow i felt the af on this is not as quick as my f non is zoom
maybe just me
but the iq color contrast sharpness on this one simply blows me away wide open or not
i use this lens shooting indoor head shots of my little yr old
she simply springs to life from this lens
the mm on d is even better than d because it gives the kid more room to be herself
the af on this lens is not the best in low light
this is true with d d rebel and d
l under the same condition works much better
this is true even with the buildin flash emitting af assist beams
with the ex however af is instant
and so does most other lenses i use
i suspect this has to do with this mm lens being of a much older design while the  is far more recentupdate april  after some years of use mostly on d mk i get to know more about this lens iq is great but not the best
actually both f and fl is seem to be better in many cases
af is not the quickest either worse in normal indoor light
flare can be a problem for this lens if shooting with a bright window in the background
fis is quite a bit better
f is much better
but under normal light this prime is greatdont let the reviews make you think this is razor sharp
i would have expected better from a prime l lens
however this lens is still quite sharp
i would have wished for is but of course that would have raised the price to a place that i dont have money for right nowjust know what you need a lens for and see if this matches
a prime at this focal length will mean a lot of walking around to frame your subjectmakes a great match for my dafter having read the glowing reviews of this lens and after consistently seeing it at or near the top of all those best canon lenses lists i recently purchased this lens used from that famous internet auction site
i shoot mostly nature photography and am not a professional portrait photographer but i was anxious to try this lens out for its famous depth of field isolation and sharpness  this lens has been reported to be among the sharpest if not the sharpest lens that canon makesi have to say that my first results were quite disappointing with this lens
i have been using the canon mm f is lens which produces the sharpest and most consistently infocus shots of any lens i have ever used
the image stabilization on that lens is fantastic and adds at least  stops of hand holdability
i have used it handheld with the canon d mark ii the canon ti and the canon d and it always produces remarkably clear infocus shots in available daylight conditions particularly at the mm end which is where i use it most
i was expecting that the mm f would be as easy to use since it is two stops brighter however i found that the lack of is severely limits the number of  keepers due to random blurs from hand shakiness
my hands are reasonably steady yet i was not able to consistently produce the crystal clear shots that i was used to with my  f lens
plus the subjects that i shoot such as plants flowers and wildlife are very threedimensional and do not reproduce well at the thin depth of field that this lens produces wide open
you only really get a small portion of the plant or animal in focus and the rest out of focus
also the closest focusing distance of  feet means that i cant get up close and personal enough to really fill the frame with my subjects the way i can with some of my other lenses which offer macro or pseudomacro settingsafter my initial disappointment i decided to try this lens out on a tripod and did some portraits both using available light and using a bounce flash
the results were like night and day
the shots came out very clean wide open with the eyes in tack sharp focus and most of the face in focus and with the nose and ears in slightly soft focus
the background was just a door but the features were completely blended out and it looks like a professional portrait
the controlled environment is where this lens really shines
when you put it on a tripod you really see what this lens can do
it produces a clean but soft quality that the f lens never can achieve
however i also have the canon mm f macro lens and that lens comes close to producing the same quality of background blur that this lens produces
that lens is also much easier to work with handheld
i guess the shorter length combined with the much lighter weight makes that lens a better choice for nature photography in the fieldi feel that this is a great lens that is showing its age
maybe its a canon classic but i feel that it is in need of an update
canon has image stabilization on its mm macro and its mm f lenses and most of the l telephoto zooms why havent they added is to this lens
sigma has a mm f lens that has macro and the brand new version has image stabilization as well
i recently picked up that lens its the sigma mm f af apo ex dg os hsm macro lens for canon digital slrs
you can read my review about it heresigma mm f af apo ex dg os hsm macro lens for canon digital slrsthe sigma lens compares very favorably to the canon mm for portraits particularly on the fullframe canon d mark ii
i shot some portraits using the sigma lens and i thought they came out even better than with the canon  plus the sigma lens has two additional things i really want which is true macro and image stabilization
i usually prefer canon lenses over sigma but in this case sigma has now oneupped canon in this focal rangeif you are making your living doing portrait photography you will definitely want this lens
it has some unique qualities
but it doesnt really serve my needs and i dont think its a particularly good fit for a walkaround lens due to its lack of versatility
its a onepurpose lens and personally i dont want to lug a tripod to the park or nature preserve
as a tripodmounted portraits ill still give this lens four stars but in todays terms of lens technology it falls short of what many lenses can achieve handheldi took the lens out a second time and had the same problem with motion blur that i had before
this is definitely a studio lens
im glad i had a chance to try out this lens but its not my favorite
thats why i love being able to buy and sell lenses on the used market its a practically free way to rent them and canon l glass never really loses its valuemy first impression of this lens was that it is compact built well but not light
i bought this lens to replace my mm  non is which was too big and too heavy to take everywhere
while the size is much smaller it is heavier than any wide angle or general purpose zoom lenses which is understandable because it is a f prime
the focus ring is very smooth
this is a big plus because you are probably going to use it often because the depth of field at f is razor thin
auto focus will get you in the ballpark but you will need to make slight adjustments
the build quality is the standard l lens build very high quality
i am a little disappointed with the sharpness wide open
it is only decently sharp wide open sharp at f and tack sharp at f
fast primes like this are meant to be shot wide open and at this price i expected better
that is the reason i gave this lens  out of  there is also noticeable vignetting at f that gets better until f
dont get me wrong this is a great lens but coming from a zoom lenses and hearing all the talk about how primes are better i was a little disappointed
if you dont mind the weight and size get the mm  non is
it is tack sharp even wide open and very versatile
if you shoot mostly portraits and like this focal length you will love this lens
it is not huge and intimidating and it wont make your arms tiredlove this lens
like all the reviews ive read it is the sharpest and smoothest lens i own
i dont always use it but when the situation allows and i want the best image i reach for this lensdisclaimer i am an amateur photographer and lots of people have commented already on the qualities of this lens so i wont be making  a review on that
i got this lens yesterday and i am using it with a canon dhere is my review  if for some reason you are considering using this lens as your walkaround lens dont
for all the things a walkaround lens should be this one is not save for being relatively affordable and having great iq
its conspicuous in both size and color heavy and imo the focal range is not flexible enough for walkaround dutiesthis is probably pretty obvious to most people but for some it might not be
so there you go
it is great for me though and agree with others who say this is a very good value lensi have had this lens for several years
it produces color accurate pictures
its a great lens for portaits
however i ended up selling it because  its a tripod only lens
its  seemed that even at high shutter speeds and spot focussing it is very difficult to get ride to the handshake blurr  when you zoom inthe efmm fl usm lens by canon is outstanding
because i am  years old i worried about hand shake but the lens is so fast that was never a problemi took photos from coit tower in san francisco and the photos of alcatraz and treasure island are so clear you can see details on the islands
when enlarged the houses across the bay in oakland are visiblei am very pleased with this lensso im starting to get more serious about my photography
i went out and bought this as my entry to the l class of lenses
i mounted it on my d at home and i didnt really see what the big deal was
it wasnt until we went out for an engagement shoot that i found the magic of this lens
the bokeh was wonderful for my portrait shots
absolutely wonderful
very crisp picturesalmost perfect because of the f  it didnt do so well in the shade
but i cant really complain since the  is almost twice as much and the l is which is almost unreachable for the amateur
but one day it will be mine oh yes it will be minei dont mind the white paint either makes it look professional
we were out on location and as soon as we took it out bystanders got out of the way of our shootso in summation its a great price to try out the l lenses
this and the l
but remember that its an f and that its white if that makes a big deal to youi recieve my canon ef mm fl usm telephoto zoom lens today and for my surprise the color of the lens is not white like the all picture shows the color is like brownthis is a different type of lens l from canon
someone have a explanationcanon ef mm fl usm telephoto zoom lens for canon slr camerasincredible lens
use it for sports and event photography with a flash and the results are incredibly sharp and focus is always spot onthis was one of the first lenses i bought for my camera beyond the kit lens and i must say it has served me very well
at the wide end mm it is just wide enough to capture the majority of the shots i need and at the long end mm it provides the extra reach i need to get closer to my subjects without getting in the way
this lens is also reasonably quick f and works surprisingly well in low light conditions
unfortunately i now need something a little longer and faster and even with a x teleconverter its just not enoughprosquick and decent performance even in low light conditionsgood range with wide angle and telephoto abilitieslight and compact that makes it easy to carry around all dayconsnot as long as id likenot as fast as the f lens canon ef mm fl is usm telephoto zoom lens for canon slr camerasno image stabilizationthis is an amazing lens
there are some things i dont like but overall worth the money for what it can dook so ill just say that the canon mm f lens on the d mark ii is a fantastic alternative to the more expensive counterparts
its extremely fast autofocus is quiet and accurate
you even have  settings to further improve its alreadyfast speed
next  is a huge amount of space to work with
not quite telephoto enough for wildlife shots or planets on a canon d mark ii but still a great range if you do weddings or sports etc this lens is also fantastic with a macro extension tube but get the canon tubes never the cheap ones
the lens is sharp very clean and very accurate
if you know how to meter your shots right and expose properly then all you have to do is point focus and shoot and this lens will ensure clean imagesok so its clean and sharp and fast on the d mark ii but there are a couple things i dont like that arent a big deal but remind me that this is the cheapest of the l series lenses
first it doesnt seal as well as youd expect from an l series lens when connecting to the body
there is a little tiny bit of play there that doesnt quite seem as weatherresistant as they advertise
again maybe this is only because its the cheaper version
i still used it in rain and wind but ended up having to clean my sensor and both ends of the lens optics
second thats it
this lens is greati orginally purchased the  f l is usm but was not impressed
the is version was very loud and the image quality was not what i expected
maybe i received a defective lens
so i returned that lens and purchased the nonis version which was about  the price not to mention there was a rebate offered through canon
this lens is much better
the image quality is definitely better and although lacking in is that can be mitigated by proper holding technique andor tripods
i do wish it was the l but for the price could not be happier
most of the time im using this lens is not in lowlight so the f is adequate
if trying to decide whether to get this lens or the more expensive f versions decide first whether you shoot in enough lowlight that you need the extra fstop of light
the only other real advantage of the more expensive f is that it allows for better bokeh
if you dont know what bokeh is or dont need the lowlight capabilities then get the f
if you do care about bokeh or find that you need that extra fstop of light for shooting indoors or lowlight situations then get the f
however if you get this lens you will still be happy with what it will allow you to dothe picture taking quality of this lens is hard to beat  good clear crisp edge to edge images
however  if you are taking pictures in shade or low light or want good depth of field and the shutter speed gets below  it is hard to hand hold without image blur from the shake
i do get some good pictures hand held at even  but not always  monopod helps and tripod completely corrects the shake problem
i am not sure how much of this problem is corrected by the very expensive image stabilization offered in the  fl is lens but i doubt it is worth the  difference
i do have a couple lenses with image stabilization and with low shutter speed and they can also blurthe main criticism i have of this lens is that it is heavy and bulky which makes it less pleasant to take on trips or hiking
i also have an efs  lens which doesnt take quite as good pictures but is shorter and lighter and i find that i will select it for hikes
the ef  is too long to fit in my canon camera carrier which means i need to carry it in a separate backpackthe two problems of sizeweight and image stabilization can be worked around and top quality pictures can be taken with this lensadded after original reviewafter taking pictures with this lens for three more weeks i find that i hate to take it off the camera  it takes much better pictures than any of my lenses
unfortunatly now i wont be satisfied with any lens that isnt lbackground i bought my first digital camera in january of  before that i had a professional canon slr mm
i got the ti on a good deal off of bh the camera is a great starter and im not one for whoopty doopty features
after about  months things got real and i got the opportunity to shoot a professional gig for a major league soccer game in the press box
my kit lens did the job for everything but it couldnt get distance
so i started to look for a new lensabout the lens canon l lenses are known for their superior optics
these lens captures that and takes the features you may not need and removes them giving everybody the chance to own an l lens
the fstop is one ok
 for full frame cameras and ok for smaller sensors
the fact that there is no image stabilization has gone unnoticed by myself and fellows friends who have tried this lens out
the faster the shutter speed the better it gets the slower the shutter speed the move motion blur you get
for slower shots try the following use a tripod or monopod
for those who dont own either themanfrotto mmc compact  section aluminum monopod for cameras blackis a good starter monopod
read my review on it too
 play with your settings
lower the iso or raise it
play with aperture
just play with your camera before anything important so you know how to peak its performancewhats in the box
with the lens comes the following the lens duh a soft sided bag with padded bottom
this bag works great but put it inside of another camera bag like thecanon deluxe photo backpack eg for canon eos slr cameras black with green accent lens hood
this hood is alot bigger than what i generally like to use but it came free so i cant complain as it has worked just fine for me
 assorted manualsbottom line i dont know why canon hasnt decided to make a new lineup of budget l lenses
it could really improve sales for them as many people now have moved from point and shoots to either their phone or a prosumer cameras like the d and d
if the go the latter they dont want to spend on a good lens so they stick with the kit lens or crappy rd party lenses
so for those who are looking heres my point
dont shy away from lens because of the lack of is its not really noticeable
and for those more interested in photography the fstop is just fine
yeah a  would be better but i already said that canon should release another line of lenses
absolute bottom line dont think about it just get ithave to agree with so many reviews already out there for this lens one does wonder if adding another review does actually make sense
but since im one of the few people who werent actually thrilled by the lens happy but not thrilled i still decided to go ahead and put down my  centsto begin with this is unquestionably a good quality lens
to doubt the quality of this proper l series lens is like doubting the space time continuum itself
i wouldnt go into the technical aspects of it either people more experienced and knowledgeable than me have done enough justice to itthe thing  which makes or breaks the deal is whether or not this would you be your first purchase of a zoom lens or whether you are purchasing this as an upgrade from another consumer zoomif this is the first zoom lens then this is a no brainer
agree its almost double the cost of other consumer zooms from canon or sigmatamaron but do yourself a favor
wait and save the money  for this or consider buying a used version they usually sell for less than  and you wont be disappointedif you are considering this as an upgrade think twice about it
i bought this as an upgrade from one of the sigma zooms and even though the autofocusimage quality of this is way superior i just wasnt blown away
i eventually ended up selling this one and am now saving for the   f l is and contrary to popular belief its not the same lens with is added but a newer version of the glass as wellto sum it up its still a great lens and definitely one of the cheapest l series lens
but do consider the is version before buying thisi bought the mm canon for my canon d because i wanted a medium long telephoto that wouldnt break my back carrying it around or break the bank buying itthe canon pretty much fit the billthe  is fairly light for a medium long lens
you can carry it all day without sabotaging your arms or backbuild quality is very good
it also has that sexy white look of canon quality that impresses other photographers unless they know enough to tell its the baby of the canon long l telephotosshooting wise it is fairly sharp and fairly contrasty to the point that its a somewhat suprisingly good lens but not mindblowing unlike a few tamrons ive owned which are mindblowing for the priceautofocus is very fastsome day i plan to get a x or a x tele extenderit would be nice if the lens were perhaps faster than f but thats probably asking too much at the priceall in all a very nice medium long light telephoto that wont break the bank giving suprisingly good but not mindblowing resultsand the build quality and that canon white look are both a bonus terrythis is my main telephoto lens
for the price it is awesome
the l series glass is the best in the canon line and this lens holds up
it takes great pictures and the autofocus is fast and precisenow there are some concerns that i would like to address for people who want to buy this lensthis lens struggles at night
being a f it does not allow in as much light the f
this will make you have to use a lower shutter speed and a higher iso resulting in lower quality images
shooting at night on highschool fields produces alright images
they are alittle blurry due to the high iso and the slower shutter
if you are shooting stills or dont expect to get crystal clear shots of a baseball being hit off the bat you will have no problems
if you need a lens that can do this look to the fduring the day i do not regret not having the is
if there is enough light you can have a fast enough shutter not to worry about the shakiness
at night you can have similar problems when shooting without a flashoverall in the day almost perfect
sometimes i wish i had alittle more range but those lenses are so much more expensiveat night you can still get good images but dont expect to replicate the performance you get in the daya great lens for the person looking for a low end l telephoto
i would recommend to a friendthis lens isnt being made anymore but you can still buy it used
it is a gem of a lens
i started photography with a rebel xsi then went to a rebel ti and finally a d mark ii
the single change in my gear that made the most difference was buying a flash but second to that was this lens
this lens is exceptionally sharp
the focus motor is quiet and fast
and its extremely light
did i mention the colors and sharpness
they are outstandingheres a picture i took with it recentlythis lens is very cheap as lenses go
i didnt realize it when i bought my canon eos d a couple years ago
i have had one complaint with this lens since i got it not very sharp
not having a lot of slr experience i wasnt sure if the problem was the lens or the digital camera
or was it the alorithms in the camera for convering the image to jpg
after all sharpness is just one of the parameters you can set in the camera
so what i ended up doing was bumping the sharpness in the camera all the way up to get the kind of sharpness in the image i was looking forwhat i am talking about is say the edges around your subjects face are not sharp or your daughters freckles arent quite crisp enough etcso i tried a friends l series canon lens and got exactly what i was looking for crisp sharp more like my eyes saw the image as i was taking the picture
so in short a really good lens that takes really sharp pictures costs a lot of money  or  times what this lens costs
sadly i already bought one l series lens and it is so amazing i am now forced to buy another onebut i just wanted to write this review in case you were wondering why your otherwise awesome looking pictures are just not as sharp as you might have expected
this lens is great in all other aspects and as i am realizing now nice and light weight
but if youre obsessive like i apparently am you might want to fork out more money for a better quality lensi had been using the  for years on a series of canon dslrs starting with the original d and culminating with the d
finally decided to spring for the l
i was immediately surprised that pix from the new lens didnt look so great as x higher price would suggest
detailed comparisons showed the  was just as good in many instances
one edge not the other of the l was a bit better but center sharpness was no better even wide open
contrast seemed equally good
i returned the l to the dealer and kept the  while its true the zoom range is less i also like the much lighter weight and more compact form of the this is a goodvalue lens that was designed back in the days of mm film cameras although canon still sells it as of  and it works fine on canons digital models
it is a standard ef lens that will fit all of canons digital cameras
it is not one of those efs lenses that is restricted to the eg
d  d rangei believe it is one of the least glamorous lenses that canon sells in the sense that it has a moderate zoom range that is neither particularly wide nor particularly zoomy it is not the cheapest or the most expensive ef lens it is not the most or the least fullyfeatured it is neither flimsy nor rocksolid
it uses usm focus which is silent and generally accurate
it doesnt have image stabilisation
it doesnt have a constant aperture
the zoom range is roughly mm on a x cropped sensor body such as a canon d  d
the zooming mechanism on my example doesnt creep
the closest focus distance seems relatively far something like a foot and a bit
the manual focus ring feels a bit cheap but then again the autofocus is fast and quiet so it balances out
it has a mm filter thread which is an odd sizei have had a chance to take a few shots on a tripod at different apertures
at f it has a nice tight field of view and it is decently sharp it seems to jump up in sharpness between f and f and doesnt get much sharper beyond that
on my mm canon  with an uncropped field of view there is noticeable distortion at both the wide and the tele ends
this is less noticeable on a cropped d although it is still noticeable
otherwise the image quality has no obvious glaring deficiencies
the background blur is pleasant
i found that i had to underexpose by a stop to get the exposure just right but that might be me or the cameraits attractive as a useful wellpriced walkabout lens for digital cameras for people who dont mind the relatively tight field of view mm is just slightly wideangle
the only problem i can see is that the zoom bellows seems to suck up dust
my example had quite a few specks although apparently this has an almost unnoticeable effect on image quality
its a shame that canon doesnt include a lens hoodmy problem has been with the batterymuch shorter life between charges
otherwise its an ok tool that handles welllike a lot of people these days the only war i am personally having on the home front is the one against telemarketers and unwanted calls in general
it remains inconceivable to me that in this day of such technology that leaves us in awe at times we still are unable to control who it is an how often our privacy is invaded in the very place where we live
my telephone service provider allows is to block certain calls but only with a limit of  that is just about useless
most telemarketers have several lines they can switch over to and always seem to do
and it is totally ineffective against so called unavailable calls
to my knowledge there has still not been invented a call screening machine that refuses or blocks anonymous and unknown calls as well as blocks an unlimited amount of numbers
until that time we are forced to settle for some system of second best in the war on the front line of our peace and solitudei recently picked up this zenith hang up at a local electronics show
i installed it without directions im a man were supposed to do that and had it up and running in a minute or two
this little gadget is just about as simple as it gets for such a device
when you get a call that is unwanted you simply press the button and a message is immediately dispatched twice informing the caller that you do not accept such calls and to remove you from any further calling lists
as most people now know there is a national no call registry that is just about as useless and infective as one would expect some government run operation to be
telemarketers frequently either by pass or just ignore the list and call you anyway
also charities and other calls like politically motivated ones are immune from the list in any event
past practice of my trying to inform the callers of my being on the list as the no call registry suggests has been equally useless in being effective
you not only have to often interrupt their well informed speech designed specifically for you not to be able interrupt but even when you get a word in they often just hang up before hearing your whole frustration
this zenith unit does not spare you the bother of getting up to see who is calling but it does provide and easy non personal approach to getting your point across without having to speak to anyone or hear any part of anyones well rehearsed speal
it also immediately stops the phone from ringing effectively ending the call when you activate it
it is definitely not the greatest technology i am hoping gets invented for this horribly frustrating problem but is certainly better than just letting the phone ring itself out without answering or facing down the problem personally without much success
if youre like me you screen most calls before answering anyway so getting up to see who is calling is a part of the call process in any event
i do not find it that to be much of an inconvenience overallin conclusion there are two important things to be considered when purchasing this unit which in my opinion comes out as big plus for buying it  one is the fact that i have  no real weigh in on its effectiveness as some other reviewers have made a point of
keeping track of how many of these culprits it seems to stop is sorta like locking your doors and night and wondering how well it is stopping anyone from entering your home
it certainly can do no harm and is far better than doing nothing at all
personally i have noticed a drop in the number of calls i have been receiving since installing it so for what its worth i feel it is being very effective
lastly there are other more sophisticated systems available for a lot more money on amazon and the internet that pretty much promise to do nothing more than this one does for a very fair price in comparison
the more expensive units do things like offering you the opportunity to leave your own message and or keeping a log of the numbers called and blocked
neither being a premium i consider valuable or which i personally care about
i simply want some of my privacy back in my own home for as little money spent period
trust me that at the time of this writing this reasonably priced zenith system is as cheap and as effective as it comes for this problem that is available
i highly recommend buying one and installing it on the phone you are often closest too and if you have a large home with several phones that you buy as many as you need
you may just come to feel that it is the best money you have spent in quite some timefinally lcd monitors are not prohibitively expensive for those of us on a budget
many people are wary when they hear  inches but the viewable image size is the same as that of most  monitors
unfortunately with a lcd you are stuck at  x  resolution whereas with a  crt you can change the resolution to whatever you like
the advantage of fixed pixels is that the image is extremely crisp and clear  absolutely no fuzziness or bluriness
however if you use interpolation to change the resolution to something lower than the native  x  the lcd has to use discrete pixels to compensate for partial pixels and the results is something extremely fuzzy and hard to look at
thus for many gamers i do not recommend this display as refresh times are inferior to crts and resolution is limited to a single option
another drawback to this lcd is that it is actually not very bright
one thing you lose when you buy a cheaper lcd is brigtness
while all lcds are signifiicalty dimmer than crts the vbk is not even as bright as its competitors
if your work environment is an office with few windows and not much light you probably wont notice a problem
however if you plan on working in an space where natural light can reflect off your screen you will quickly find that your monitor becomes nearly unusable
what about color consistancy
many have railed against lcds for their poor color accuracy but the truth is that unless you are a professional graphic designer  and anyone buying this  monitor is probably not in the graphics design industry  colors look great and this argument is not an issue
another nice thing about this monitor is that it runs very cool and quiet and will save you a lot on your electricity bill and general fatigue
personally i am very fond of the black color as it looks much more professional and less cheap and generic than some comparablypriced noname beige lcds
viewing angle is acceptable although more expensive lcds and certainly any crt is more impressive in this arena
thus if you plan on using your monitor to give presentations you should probably look elsewhere
text appears crisp and readable as long as it is not too small and the image is rock solid
overall a highlyrecommended product for general use unless your needs fall into the categories i warned against in this reviewthe speed i attained was  kbps far slower than the mbps i achieved with the wired connection with the same dlp wireless router
otherwise signal strength was very good to excellent from only  stars because i need to download linuxwlanng which isnt shipped with the kernel but thats the only complaint it works with wavemon too
it is nice and compact enough so that a shorter usb ab cable would be an advantage for packing in a laptop casei received this unit as a networking kit with the di  gateway
had some problems initially but then it started working
i dont know what i did but it worked and has been humming right along for a weekhad some problems in the beginning but after a little tinkering all was well
every so often i have to reboot it and my router to make it work
but for the price i guess it will doill have to see how they hold out but seem alright so far
im one of the remaining dinosaurs that still tape shows to watch on a vcrive always appreciated maxells quality and now i finally have the ability to record  hours  in extended mode at a timemy hubby  i still use our vcrs everyday and we need reliable video tapes
maxwell has been a steady product
were looking at dvr technology but we get more on our tapes  my hubby doesnt get as annoyed with them
long live the vcrjust what i expected and wanted
great selleri havent had too many problems with my predator but my brother got one that didnt work right out of the package
i have burned about  cdr discs and i have only had one that was ruined
i blame this on the fact that my drive hadnt been defragged in ages and i left a few programs open that i now close
typically before burning i close out of all nonessential programs closing some by hitting ctrlaltdelete suspend any maintenance programs and do a weekly defrag if i am burning a lot
so far this technique has allowed me to burn perfectly at x speed
i use verbatim and memorex discs
my computer is an ibm thinkpad with  mb of ram and a  mhz celeron processorthe software is nice and convenient although as usual one must purchase an upgrade to get many of the really nice features like audio cleaning for records etc
it comes with musicmatch and an upgrade code for it although you can still upgrade even further for more 
i personally enjoy musicmatch as an audio playerrecorder
i would say the usb snapon adaptor which can be upgraded to firewire is very convenient
the fact it can be upgraded gives the unit more life than others although at higher speeds one might expect more skips
however the usb connector seems flimsy
the predator also makes a lot of noise and when it ejects the disc it does so almost violently making me think one day it might break
another complaint is about quotburn proof technologyquot the predator doesnt have it
so potentially cds can end up being digitally encoded coastersoverall i am happy and have had very few problems
i can only speak for myself but i have made many cds of high quality that i enjoy
i would suggest using the precautions i listed above and see if those dont help prevent skipping when recording
however some computers just might not work with the drive
the predator works fine for me and that is all i can report
oh it has worked perfectly for my brother tooanyone demanding fast errorfree cdrw performance should realize that usb connections sadly do not permit this
the original usb was a slowspeed technology intended for simple devices such as keyboards mice and printers
cdrw buyers are better off buying firewire serial or internal drivesif you must buy a usb cdrw drive and you have an older computer predating usb  then this drive is a good choice  its included software is very good the drive itself is solid and setup is simplei bought my predator because my computer at the time did not support devices requiring serial or scsi ports nor would it support additional internal drives
so usb was my only optionthere are some issues to be aware of the included adaptec software was the best entrylevel cdburning software in  at the time iomega did not skimp on the included software
the packaged software and drivers that i received were slightly dated even then and not very windows friendly but the latest updates including wk support were available online
something called buffer underruns are a risk for all old usb cdrw drives because the slow usb had difficulty keeping pace with the high speed that cdrw drives require to burn cds smoothly
because cdwriting requires reliable speed out of your computer even if youre not in a hurry i would not recommend using this drive with a slow computer fragmented hard drive or limited ram
while i was able to burn cds at x the slowness of the old usb again means that you may have the best luck holding back your drive speed to x so it doesnt get too far ahead of your computer
if you decide eventually to ditch usb and use firewire instead then you can ramp up the predator to full speed with confidence
i dont know why but verbatim cdrw disks worked better with this drive than either the included iomega disks or the new imation disks that i bought
none of the disks became coasters but for some reason the iomega and imation cds would frequently suffer buffer underruns if i saved much data at one time
maybe it was a coincidence
anyhow the remedy was to save less data on these cds and to reformat them eating up a lot of time each time an underrun occurred
this drive comes with an included firewire adapter  much more reliable than the old usb technology if your computer supports firewire connectionsthe predator fulfills basic needs for people limited to firstgeneration usb while also providing the power speed and reliability in the coming era of firewire peripheralsbut you would be wiser to buy a more current drive that supports usb  as well as slower connectionssetup was a snap
unplugged old modem plugged in this one renewed my ip address and i was instantly on the internet
att had given me a website to register the new modem at so it was really convenient
also the new modem has somehow increased my upload and download speeds over my att supplied modemthe only problem was the ad says you can use this modem via usb with an optional adapter
 i dont really care cause i am using the ethernet connection anyway
just a notegood head phones for a decent price
they feel kinda loose on my head at times but they have good soundfor the money these are very good headphones i can use at worki just plug them into my harmankardon speakers for the pcfor the minuses treble sounds quotbrassyquot some minor distortionsfor the plusses very good bass
if youre not into rap you dont need more bass
i am a pretty big guy so the size is adequate
and no they dont look like grapefruit halves on my head more like lemon halves
the overall clarity is decent
long cord allows for some mobilitysince the plusses outweigh the minuses its a good buynothing beats a nice home stereo with premium speakers but these headphones are a practical solution for workhome office music needssetting up and using this card under windows  couldnt have been easier
after following the included setup card i was up and running with no further problems
setup involved simply plugging the card in and installing drivers from the included cdi use the card with a linksys wireless access point that sits behind at least one wall
while the overall distance from the access point is never huge a couple of walls at most and maybe  feet i havent had any problems with link qualityi did encounter one problem in which the connection to the access point would suddenly terminate
i could only get it back by taking out the card and reinstalling it
it turns out the problem was actually with the access point not with this card
specifically it appears that disabling ssid broadcast on the linksys access point can cause problemsmy main complain about the product itself is that it doesnt support  bit encryption although the linksys access point does
also the linksys documentation and website are mediocre at besti purchased this product in conjunction with the linksys wireless port cabledsl routerafter setting up the router i installed the pc card into a dell laptop with xp home
xp easily loaded the drivers
my only problem was that i had a typo with the wap key value
after correcting i was connected to the internet
range is good with strong  signal strength downstairs and in the the back yard
never needed to read the pdf manuali really wish that i could yell accolades for this product
 out of  though does not make this possible for me
i bought two of these and a wireless routerlinksys and had a client up and running in  minutes awesome
i bought one for my house and didnt work and had to send it back
the support people were decent and were quick to give up and say its the hardware
all in all the linksys wireless system is an awesome thing once it is set upits not without a little pain but it does work
you have to pull down the windows driver for the card then use your distros ndiswrapper to emulate the windows driver to the linux os
with that done it works just dandyon top of that its a nice card
whatever it works
nothing special but worthy of a positive reviewi bought this linksys pc card because all of my other wireless products are made by linksys and i know the stuff is good
i live in a  story townhouse where i sometimes work in our garage
the reception in the garage vary from quotvery goodquot and quotgoodquot while everywhere else in the house is almost always quotexcellentquot or quotvery goodquot
while that is good for going to the net and play online game the card crashes my laptop everytime i try to upload large amount of data mb from my laptop to my stations
i dont have that problem when i switch to the good old category  cable
so while this card is good for everyday use i am not sure if it can handle large amount of data
however this is my own observation
the problem could have easily caused by something else
all in all it is a good reliable productthis is somewhat odd
considering the casing of the card would indicate that it is probably an orinocolucent card it seems to have a shorter range than the orinocothe software is a bit more complex than the orinocos so it confused me a little in the start
but once the proper configuration was done it workedi am currently using it with the smc barricade also ordered from amazon and it seems to work just finethis is wirelessb  and is good for older notebook compatibility on a mixed wireless systemi used this card for over a year now at my home wireless network and at an office wireless network
it was used with the linksys wap
office has metal framing but didnt seem to cause interference
its proven to be a reliable solution for me
i would recommendthis card is the equivalent of the gold orinoco
the silver orinoco only handles bit wep encryption
the gold handles up to bit encryptionobviously the better choicesome people said that they had problems installing this device on xp or some other wintel platform unless they upgraded the firmwarei didnt
it worked with every os ive tried wink pro and server winxp home and pro winme
maybe the older models needed a firmware upgradewho knowsi did however have a problem installing this on redhat  supposedly this is one of the cards that is autodetected by pcmcia card services in that releasebut oh well
took me quite a while to get it working
at least ive got a traditional ethernet card builtin to my notebook too so that i could get online and look around
linksys support for the open source movement is suprisingly limited compared to other card manufacturersif you are an open source freak go with an orinoco or lucent  those have always worked right off the bat for me in mandrakes and redhatsotherwise linksys is great
and the wireless port dslcable router is great in conjunction with thisnote people please encrypt your wireless networks
its generally very easy to do and can prevent serious damage to your networksokay this product doesnt get  stars because the manual is about as useful as ice cubes in alaska
the setup files are not in the proper location and the really useful utility is not prominently mentioned
the utility is a lifesaver on the cdrom under xwpcwdtutility it allows configuration of the nic card without constant rebooting
for me the mode setting is on infrastructure ssid on linksys txrate on fully automatic and ps mode is disabled
i am cruising around my home with solid internet connections everywhere
it just doesnt get any better
the setup can be a little confusing but the turnaround time with tech support was less than  minutes although the recording quoted  minutes
wireless broadband is nontrivial but it is by no means impossible and when working thoroughly enjoyablei bought this card because the prism chipset is supported by an open source project that would allow me to use it with my hp laptop running redhat linux the most difficult part about getting this card up and running on my linux laptop was a lack of thorough information on the steps needed to get the card running not a typical open source situation
i plan on writing a thorough tutorial and posting it soon
i downloaded and compiled the drivers as per the most thorough tutorial i was able to find online and couldnt get the card to link to the ap
after some playing around with config files i discovered that the tutorial forgot to mention the absolutely important edits to a few config files not just the wlanngconf files that would get this puppy flyin
so once i got those edited i picked up a fairly strong signal about  to the ap which is a few hundred feet away in the middle of the shop in the back of our building and behind two walls with a server room also sitting between me and the ap
the only issues ive had since getting it installed is the ap has dropped off a few times and it had to be power cycled nothing to do with the wpc card
and i have had other aps cause interference when they were within say  feet of me and between me and the ap in the middle of the shop even though their ssid wasnt the one i was looking to connect to and id hardcoded the ssid into the conf file
thats probably just an b problemas for a wink install
not a problem
strong signal from the same ap my laptop dualboots wink rh linux  from the time i entered the ssidso my opinion is this anything i can get to run in linux that the manufacturer doesnt ship drivers for is a bonus
anything i can get to work as well as this card does in linux i will surely recommend
i was so impressed with the way this card works ive ordered a linksys wcf card with the sharp zaurus i just ordered
im confident that ill have similar luck with getting the wcf card working happily in the zaurus which is also linux based because of my luck with the wpc cardpart of the reason i might not have had a problem was that when i bought my card i made sure it was version  a little online research told me that was the most current card and i downloaded the updates from linksyscom before i attempted to install the card in wk
the only odd thing i noticed was that my leds are quite dim so they really dont give me effective feedback
if i hadnt gotten the card working so well i wouldve returned it as defective for the led problem but since it works well and i have tools to monitor the card anyway i dont worry about the ledsso i give the card only  stars because linksys doesnt bother to provide drivers for linux with the card
they do provide a link to the opensource wlan project  url  but none on the linksys site or install cdi am not sure why the reviews for this item have been so universally poor
i bought this unit to replace a defective dlink card
i liked it so well i kept it and bought another
granted i am probably a little more experienced then a normal user but i found it installed easy enoughthe biggest negative i found was its lack of monitoring software and inadequate documentation
performance wise i think the unit actually outperforms the dlink card
i am using a smc wireless router and had not trouble hooking the card up
i use the dlink monitoring software with this card and it seems to work finei feel that i can recommend this product with little reservation
the only thing any of us usually have to fear with linksys is there notoriously poor customer support and documentation
if you can deal with these two things this might be an economical choice for a wireless lani started out trying to use a wpcgs with my sony vaio but it never successfully connected to the internet using wep encryptionthe signal range on this card is at least as good as on the wpcgs maybe betterthe only reason this product gets  instead of  stars is that i tried installing the latest drivers from the linksys website
everything seemed ok until it was time to reboot the computer at which point startup failed
i had to reinstall win unfortunately not an unusual occurrence recentlyif you buy this product i strongly recommend using the bundled cdrom to install it
a later attempt to update the driver revealed that the online version was the same as the one on the cdromi was able to easily set up the wireless network card
the throughput was not what i hoped for because of the distance from the base unit but is adequate for most needs except for backups which can take all night
the protruding part of the card is the antenna and it needs some clear space around it or it wont get any signal at all ie
the link light starts flashing if you bring a hand too close to it
otherwise this product is a good alternative to running physical wires and good for laptops which need to roam aboutthe linksys works well for your basic wireless nic
the config software gives nice link and signal info
setup is straight forward just understand infrastructure and addhoc modes and which one applies to your setuprange is not great and moving your hand nearit cause the link to go from a good connectionto a poor one
still it works and usuallydelivers a pretty fast mbs connectionsetup was easy wwith my introduction to the electrostatic world via the sr with srms amp and it completely blowing me away soundwise i started looking to see what was sold new today for an affordable price range headfi affordable not real world affordable but i digress
the koss esp immediately jumped out at me
electrostatic headphone with an amp sometimes sold for less than 
i had to check them outkoss is usually associated with headphones that are budget conscious delivering great sound without breaking the bank
by now you guys probably know how much of a fanboy i am of the ksc and ksc
i will always have at least one pair of koss headphones in my lifetime
the koss esp has been part of kosss repertoire for a few decades known for their incredibly linearity well balanced yet musical sound
the esp comes bundled with their e electrostatic amp
it uses a proprietary headphone input so it only works with the esp
the great thing about koss is that their well known lifetime warranty is also applicable here so if for any reason these fail you you can get them replacedfixed by koss directly
more companies should follow this type of business mindset
standing behind their products for as long as you livebuild quality unfortunately the build quality is without question the worst build i have seen on a headphone costing more than 
it literally feels like a  headphone to me
the internals could be made out of styrofoam and i wouldnt doubt itseriously i dont know what it is but electrostatic headphones seem to focus purely on sound quality and not build or aesthetics at least until you hit flagship level stax headphonesstarting with the cups they seem to be the best area of the esps build
the grills look decent enough and feel solid enough
its all plastic and not a very good feeling plastic at that
seriously it feels like this kind of plastic belongs on no name brand budget cans
the extension bars seem to be the only thing made out of metal and yet it still feelslooks a bit too thin for my personal taste
unfortunately the arms dont like to stay at the length you adjust them to and i can almost guarantee that it will set itself a bit more loose than anyone may like
that is unless you have a gargantuan head and wear these fully extended
the headband is made of some cheap feeling pleather that could stand to be a little more dense inside but is ultimately quite comfortable as the headphone is so light and loose the headband feels like it practically just rests therethe pads
oh the pads
they are made of incredibly cheap feeling pleather of the worst kind
seriously pick out an extremely cheap over ear headphone and im sure the pleather pads would be comparable to the ones on the esp
despite my absolute hate for these kinds of pads they are actually not uncomfortable by any mean of the word
due to how loose the esp clamps to the head the pads dont really put much pressure on the skin so it doesnt induce much if any sweatthe cable is of the standard flat ribbontype cabling found on most if not all electrostatic headphones i have seen
this is a good thing
this basically guarantees no accidental tangling
its a bit short of length though it comes with an extension cable of decent length
unless you sit right next to the amp youre guaranteed to use the extension cablenow im not sure if its a build issue or just typical of electrostatics didnt hear it on the sr but the esp retains some static noise even if unpluged
you literally have to touch the contacts at the end of the cable to make the noise dissipatecomfort as mentioned before the esp is incredibly lightweight and incredibly loose fitting think ad type looseness
while the comfort overall is pretty good the lack of secure fit makes it a little less pleasing than it shouldve been
the headband is very comfy and the pleather pads while of horrible quality is a nonissue due to the loose fitaccessories the esp comes in a very very nice leather bag used to fit the headphone the amp a battery pack without batteries to allow the e to be used on the go a pair of rca cables and mm cables
if only they spent less time with accessories and more time with the build quality of the headphone itself but thats just a personal gripeisolationleakage as expected on open and electrostatic headphones there is absolutely no isolation or passive noise cancelling
these are not to be used where noise control is importantsound so to the meat of the review
as advertised the esp is certainly a very linear very balanced and very well behaved headphone
these are among the flattest sounding headphones i have heard where nothing really sticks out over anything else
the upper and lower ends are slightly rolled off meaning there is no direct bass energy or treble sizzle
the sound as a whole was indeed quite neutral with a hint of warmth
there is a very good sense of space and soundstage is decent but not a stand out over what ive reviewed so far
the esp is soft sounding a hint laid back and polite overall
its quite the contrast compared to the sr which was quite fast lively energetic and aggressive while maintaing some amazing clarity and refinement
thats not to say the esp is muted or lacking in clarity
on the contrary
the esp is among the most detailed headphones i have ever heard
its most evident during gaming from what i experienced
the esp while not being the most musical headphone is still very enjoyable
not sterileclinical and not colored in any real waybass while the bass is slightly rolled off at the extreme lower end its not a steep roll off
with bass heavy music the bass has a surprising amount of presence
its a bit soft hitting and slow in the bass compared to the sr which was very agile and punchy but rolled off quite a bit faster
the esps bass overall is enjoyable and atmospheric but doesnt bring immediate attention to itself
it could stand to gain a bit more speed and punch but it doesnt sound bass light by any means just somewhat politemids this is easily the biggest strength of the esp
the slight warmth and linear frequency aside from the bass and treble roll off ensures the mids are slightly forward and immediately engaging
though not as sultry and intimate as the lcd it does have a similar organic tonal quality to it
basically voices sound very realisticnatural
if you have a lot of music that relies on vocals more than anything the esp will not disappointtreble the treble is ever so slightly rolled off but its not veiled or muddy
it gives the esp a pleasing clarity to the upper range without any of the harshness found on headphones with more treble quantity
among the most pleasant treble presentations i have heard
not too rolled off not too sparkly
its in a good place
trebleheads may want a clearer treble presentation like that found on the sr however
in this aspect alone the esp takes on a more musical than realistic approachsoundstage as previously mentioned the soundstage while not being a stand out is quite natural sounding in size
depth isnt an exact strength but there is an appreciable amount of width with great instument separationclarity again like the hd and lcd the esp is slightly on the warmer side of neutral yet like the other two clarity for gaming was very very impressive
actually if the soundstage was larger and depth was better these may have been right up there with the akg kxs in terms of god mode inducing clarity and performance
if i had to rate the clarity for gaming alone itd be an easy amping a nonissue as the esp comes with its own amp though people do take the extension cable and mod it to allow the esp to be used with more robust stax amps
in any case the e drives the esp quite decently based on what im hearing though the amps volume control is an absolute pain as each side has its own independent volume control so youll have to match by ear
to get around having to constantly readjust with different sources i set it once and controlled the volume with my compass used it as a preamp
in terms of gaming mixamp owners will probably want to set the volume once on a high decibel level and adjust volume with the mixamp or other dh devices
the e is also not the quietest amp with some very slight background noise that occurs randomlyvalue the prices fluctuate wildly but if you can score them near the  range they are an incredible value
electrostatic headphone amp bag portable battery pack
all your bases are mostly covered
the build quality doesnt not compliment its price howeverfinal impressions those looking for an incredibly well balanced linear and neutralish headphone may find the esp to be a serious contender for your money
the esp favors its balance and faithful representation of sound over musicality but it remains a fine bridge between the two
for gaming it is among the best for competitive gaming with very few faults and its full sound makes it a very good headphone outside of noncompetitive usecomfort one of the most comfortable headphones i used
its very light and you barely notice its there
they wont stay on if you move around a lot
but with an energizer attached i dont see why i would want to use for portable purposes even with battery pack anyways
it does get a little warm over extended periodbuild quality the material seem cheap
the light weight of both energizer and headphones doesnt inspire much confidence
most  dynamic headphones have better build quality
the right earpiece develop and buzz after two days of use
i am returning it to amazon instead of using koss customer service which i heard honor the lifetime warranty pretty well
i will order another one and update this review based on the replacementsound quality simply world class
compared to stax lambda  koss sounds a lot warmer and relax
but the airy effortless and grainless qualities of electrostatic headphones are all there
after a lot of careful listening and comparison you realize that koss reveals almost 
as much detail as the stax but with a more relaxed and musical presentation
i actually prefer the koss sound and would listen to it a lot more than i did with staxthe esp is great but with a lot of room for improvement in build quality and packaging departmentits actually not bright or strident at all
very midrangeoriented
very smooth
a perfect balance between nottoodry and nottooliquid
just right in that quality
extreme highs  lows are rolled off and the bass lacks kick but its a pleasant forgiving pretty even tone in between that is essentially free of artifacts in the mids and highs
exceptionally refined and delicate
it does require very lean detailed digital recordings  a great source to shine its bestmine direct from amazon though has a slight ground hum issue on the right channel even when no power is connected to it though when it is connected to an audio source its even worse
its faint but noticeable to me on quiet passages
it goes away completely when i touch anything metal on the unit such as the front of the mm jack
so putting an unused mm cable in there and the other end in my waist band is a temporary solution to grounding the unit or preventing it from acting as a radio pickup
 or whatever its doing
im not sure which is occurring on it the nongrounding or radio pick up
apparently issues with the energizeramp are common and people frequently have to send the esp for replacement or repair
luckily koss has their truly perfect warranty except for maybe the fact you have to pay for shipping both waysfor kids with perfect hearing who are not bassheads or even too particular on just bass tightness regardless of volume and who plan on taking care of their ears read that keeping the volume down low and wearing musicians earplugs whenever in a loud environment this might be the beall endall of headphones
if you need a little more lowend kick  tightness or extension up top then you may want to look elsewhere
if id bought this as a youth not gotten into beatdriven electronic music and taken care with my hearing this would be the oneas an owner of several audiophile headphones the s are my first foray into electrostatic headphones
if it werent for the seemingly cheap materials used in the construction of these headphones my rating would be off the star scale
the clarity and balance of the sound and the quality of the midrange in particular are exceptional
but perhaps what really caught me by surprise is the bass its neither thumping nor weak in fact not weak at all its just satisfying and ever present without distorting and distracting from the listening experience
its like going back in time and listening to the first good loudspeakers you brought home
actually its better than that but you cant help but wax nostalgic with these headphones
of course as others have posted they appear to be a bit cheaply made though the carrying case is great and for that they get a deduction from mei love my microsoft optical mouse
i like the ergonomic form the scroll roller and the ability to set the speed and clicks of the two buttons accurately
however i am now using the second one in about five monthsthe first sign that i had of the first mouses unstable connection was that my system would lock up
it required a complete shut down cold boot for the mouse to work
i scanned for viruses checked my drivers and was rewarded by the flickering mouse that lasted a few more days
the next step in my diagnosis was to remove several programs from startup the mouse quotsqueakedquot along nicely but i noticed that the optical element was hot
after a week of rebooting and keeping the mouse in a cool dry place it diedbecause i liked the feel of the mouse i bought a replacement
a day after my mouse was installed the second identical mouse in the house experienced the death knell
this one was replaced with a product from a different manufacturer
the mice are very similardoes the convenience of a favorite tool make up for the frustration of one that fails
maybe it does since i went right out and purchased another
because there are now two optical quotmicequot in the house by two different manufacturers i have time to decide what i will do next timeit is highly possible that my first mouse was a lemon
the coincidence of the second mouse dying in approximately the same amount of time five to seven months is uncanny
does it mean that the problem is circuitry within the mouse or the power source in my housemicrosoft has so much confidence in the product they will take care of problems for three years
this tells me that i may have just been unlucky with the previous two mice or i did not realize that it has delicate circuitry and abused the poor thing
i did not take advantage of this warranty which was my mistakefor me it rates three stars
the new mouse is a five star jewel  so far so i guess it is  stars for the mousei bought the new trackball intellimouse in one of those strange fits of upgraditis that come over techies such as i at unexpected moments
several years ago i bought a logitech thumb trackball to help me with a wrist problem
it served its purpose admirably
by the time my wrist was back to normal i was a complete convert to this configurationnow this old trackball was wearing out
the buttons which rely on plastic springs were losing their bounce
they are also cut too close to the desktop which meant that i was regularly taking the unit apart to remove something that had slipped in
it was a nonoptical ball as well and the rollers which are always getting mucked up where getting harder to clean
it was timeon the surface the intellimouse looks very nice
the unit cradles my right hand perfectly and has a slightly rough surface that keeps my hand from slipping
all four buttons have excellent feel and the center wheel but has a slight rubber coating for grip and a very nice graduated movement
the ball itself turns freely with no effort under light pressure but is capable of good precision when pressure is increased to slow it down
overall impression is that this is a superbly engineered pointing devicethe intellipoint software is the usual high microsoft standard
all the buttons are definable pointers are customizable and ball and wheel response is adjustable
adjustments are also available for doubleclick speed and to adjust orientation to your thumb
there is also a nifty option that lets you use a feature called clicklock to make click and drag easierfor many this is the ideal thumb trackball mouse
unfortunately for me there is a slight design flaw that creates a source of irritation
the primary left and right mouse buttons are a tiny bit too narrow for my fingers
this means that i am perpetually hitting the outer buttons if my fingers are not perfectly placed
under game pressure or while engaged in heavy websurfing this can make you crazy fast
since the software does not permit inner and outer buttons to be defined identically the only corrective option is to turn the outer buttons off
occasionally i manage to press only the outer button and find myself repeatedly hitting the button while nothing is happening  until i realize whats going on
gradually im learning to be more precise about where i put my fingers but i could just as well have done without the outer buttons in the first placeif you are a bit more adept than me have the right kind of fingers or are already used to four button mice you will probably love this device
i find myself liking it more as i adapt to it
but there is no reason why microsoft couldnt have simply made the primary buttons large enough to prevent the problem in the first place
instead an engineering oversight keeps this mouse from getting the full honors it otherwise deservesthere is a fix to the quotbad movementquot problems with this device
after a few months of use lint and oil gets trapped in the stainless steel bearings surrounding the ball
all you need to do is pop the ball out wipe it down and use a tooth pick to clean around the three support bearings that hold the ball
pop the ball back in and it should work like new
any device that contacts a human hand will accumulate oils and lint
this device is a thumb operated trackball so if you want to use your fingers go with the trackball explorer or some other brandfor years i have used many kensingtons for production purposes and home use and what always frustrated me was that the rollers had to be cleaned at least once a day because when they got dirty would skip or slip and it was very frustrating to stop what you were doing just to get your trackball to work
i tried a friends microsoft trackball mouse and noticed how smooth it was and how i could control it it so easily so i asked for one at work i got it and it has sped my accuracy up and i have never had to clean it yet
and it still is just as accurate and smooth as when i got it  months ago
the only problem i have with it is that the right  buttons are too close together and so sometimes i hit the wrong buttons but this is nothing compared to the speed and lack of frustration i use to havei like it so much i had to get one for my mac at homekensington should get on the ball if it wants to keep up with this mousei first thought it would be bizarre to use a trackball as an architect doing autocad drawings so i been avoided the trackball for years
my boss at work kind of force us to use it actually he said try it for a month
the one i used was a logitechs trackman which use a thumb to control the ball
it took me  weeks to get use to it
i was slow at first thing were hard to click and i got a little frustrated
but your brain is always learning new tricks
i decided to get a trackball for home
i pick microsoft because i surf more at home and there are more buttons  buttons trackball and  scroll wheel which is more luxury
it took me a day to get use to the index finger
i programmed this trackball to close program with just a click
i prefer to use the thumb trackball over the index trackball
it has a more accurate feel to it
this trackball use the index finger but the thumb trackball are made with  less buttons
the logitech index trackball use batteries i got a mss laser mouse with batteries once and you always wondered when do you have to replace the batteries so it because a mental hassle
mss service is great my laser intelliexplorer died about a year
i call up ms and they sent me a new one like  months later
wash your index fingers when it gets wet it pick up dirt and you get a chucky movement and you have to rub the dirt off so this product is not as clean free as it is stated
another problem is this mouse is huge
your whole palm is on the mouse
overall this product will save my wrist in the long run
i dont get little wrist sprain anymore
it is hard at first to switch to a trackball but it is worth the try
i would give this five stars but the buttons thumb logitech is much smoother by fari used a mouse for years and suffered with hand cramps and stiffness
when  my wrist started to ache i decided it was time to lose the mouse and get a more ergonomic input device
i ended up with a logitec trackman
it took a little getting used to but hey the pain stopped and hasnt returneda few more years and a new job i moved to the ms trackball explorer and quickly became a convert
what sold me was the thumb scroll wheel which became a necessity when scanning web sites or when using almost any ms office or windows product
how could i have ever lived without this marvelthe buttons are all programmable and the wheel can be set to skip lines for faster scrolling
the optical tracking works great and since the unit doesnt move theres more desk space for piles of loose papers and junkits a great product and for me an easy way to solve the irritation of pain and crampingi love a track ball because i am not all over the desk
it stays in place and is easier to use once i got used to it
i have always used logitec but their drivers screw up their own devices
i decided to switch to microsoft because i felt that it would be much more compatible with win   it does install and operate much better but i was disappointed with how cheap it was made
it feels too light and thrown together
rough around the edges
i hope it lastsleek silver and glowing  i have this spaceage thing on my desk that delights me
its improved the position of my hand so that my cts has ebbed though i still need a wrist rest and frequent breaks
all the buttons including the wheel button are programmable bringing the total of moving gizmos to  buttons a trackball and a wheel
this alone is reason to fiddle endlessly with it trying to come up with the best combination of programming to suit the natural play of your hand
if anything there are too many possible combinations of function and you may spend a week or more playing with this puppy before you find a workable group of settingsthe functions are smooth and reasonably reliable depending on the position your hand takes
i find the lefthand buttons difficult to hit correctly with my thumb thanks to some nerve damage so i reprogrammed them until i found a way that was comfortable for me to work
i strongly suggest you do the sameif youre running win xp youll have to dl the newest intellipoint drivers but thats not a big deal
installation is a snap with plug n playi never thought id find anything that pleased me as much as my old logitech trackball but i have to say that i think this one might do it
time will tell
but right from the start i found it worth the investmenti first bought this thinking that its going to take awhile to get this to work
i bought this plus wpc from amazon
i also got an orinoco pc card silver from another vendor anyway the entire setup including unpacking the box and installing the software took only  minutes
i was able to surf the internet and browse my local networkim running windows   usb runs fine
pop the orinoco card in install the driver and change ssid done
i was up and running with both pc card on two different laptops running windows  in under  minthe manual looks a little scary and confusing
so i didnt bother with it
i was able to do the entire install and setup without the manuali have not try the range test yet but sharing the hub within couple offices on the same floor the speed and connection seems to be fine
good luckwhen i bought this item from alectrics it was very cheap about 
now i see the price is up i would get a more modern unit
i alredy owned  waps so i needed this to be compatable in a relay type system
linksys is notroious for having incompatablities between different version of the same model so beware if you need special features as you may need matched versions not just matched models
i use this wap as a range extender for my other waps and it works very well because the versions are an exact match
dont ignore this warning i did and it cost me to make it right
a note about buying from alectrics
i had given them a good review  but they kept sending me messages begging for a  rating
after the third message in two months i withdrew my reccomendationi just purchased this access point as an addition of my wired network based on smc router
the product work like a charm
i hooked it up on my router and put in the included cdrom in a computer under the same network in  minites the access point is all set to go
this would worth  starts
butnow here is something you want to be aware of
i then go to the linksys website and thought it might work better if i upgrade the firmware
the newest on the web is c while the firmware on my wap is f
this is very strange but since it seems to be the newest on the web i thought i might as well give it a try
the access point stop working immediatly once the c is installed
i search the web and found that c is a nonworking firmware
luckely i did backup the firmware and was able to get it back to f
amazon sell the one with the newest firmware do not use the newest firmware on linksyss websiteif youre the type of person that prefers easy set up and great documentation this device might not be for you
true the device connects very easily right out of the box  however customizing it is tricky
paper documentation that comes with the device doesnt tell you what ip the device is configured through or what its initial password is
i had to check out the documentation on the cd which was also tricky  even though the setup program had a link to the file it wouldnt open i had to locate the documentation by browsing the cdas a wireless switch the device works very well
its easy to configure once you get ip and password information and works without a hitch
it also has quite a few options to configureas far as distance  could be better
i often have difficulties a couple of rooms over and i dont live in a large apartmentoverall if youre a techie type of person buy it with confidence
at its price its one of the best aroundif youre at all not sure i recommend a little more researching firsti bought a wap and two cards
like other reviewers i had serious range problems
i couldnt use my notebook more than about  feet away from the wap
i assumed it was the wap and tried all sorts of different remedies to no availthen a friend loaned me an orinoco formerly lucent wavelan silver cardwow
great range much better performance my computer now goes on and off of standby correctly
i now get full signal strength everywhere in my house maximum distance from wap  feet
its raining so i cant wander around the neighborhood to see how far the signal goesalso if i ran the linksys pc card with encryption on my throughput reduced dramatically but with the wavelan card i get full performance with encryption turned oni like the styling and utilities with the linksys wap perhaps others are even better but do not buy the linksys pc cardsa now satisfied linksys wap owneri bought this product so that i could setup a wireless network in my apartment
i am using a linksys wireless card on my laptop to communicate with the wireless access point
the transmission quality is not the best and it doesnt reach the advertised distance
you can setup wep between the accesspoint and the laptop with a minimum amount of difficulty but the main point is that it doesnt go the advertised distance
but if you have the  ghz wireless phone it rarely interferes with the communication
i hope you find this review helpfulthe base unit was easy to set up and i was online with a minimum of hassle
the throughput wasnt what i expected it to be but for most of my purposes thats not a problem
the usb setup procedure was fairly straightforward
i changed the default security information just because i didnt want to be using the same defaults as anyone else in the neighborhood although i suspect the range is limited enough that it shouldnt be a major problem
the link works well except for things like network backups which can take all nightnetwork access point worked well and was easy to use
it was easy to install and get each item to communicate with each otherfirst i have limited knowledge of computers but canfollow instructions but have been hesitent in setting up a wireless network
i started with the dlink system and it was a total failure even after repeated calls to technical services
i returned it and order the linksys wap and the linksys pc card
within about  minutes i had the system installed and was online
the signal was low and would drop off often in my dauthers sublaptop
however when i used it my laptop the signal was low to good in the same area
i use it throughout my house and very seldom drop out
i ended up buying my daughter the netgear pc card
we love the netgear as it almost installed itself less than  minutes from box to online and signal is always much better than the linksys card and works great with the liksys wapfor the price this is the way to go if you dont want to wire with cat
the configuration software was a little buggy until a reload but all in all this products does what its made to do give you freedom from wiresi use this wireless hub at work with  wireless laptop cards and have no complaints
setup is pretty straight forward really simple in win  as you can swap out wireless with standard  pc network cards
also since this product utilizes the  standard can easily be integrated with other wireless solutions we use ours with another wireless hub from adtron as wellfor a home application however you would be better going with the switch version of this as you would get better multiuser performancethe pci card does the job it was supposed to
inserting cards was a little awkward and i and to visually guide the card into the slot especially since it was on the back of the computerone thing i would love to see would be additional electronics to turn it into a oneslot pcmcia port
now that would be doubly usefulworks great within my network
it replace three  port switches so cleaned up my wireing and looks much better without the clutter
price was right
good switchi had this unit for about two years then one day it just died on me
it did a great job up until then
its kind of obsolete now anyway and have replaced it with a gigabit switchit is small if you think it will be a big steamer
it does hold lots of vegetables though and for  or  people is great
as everyone says handles are the weak part but for  dollars it is a good stainless steel producti was requested to purchase a new  quart farberware pot for christmas
finding a pot with a perfect matched steamer was an added bonus
our only minor complaint is that this pot uses a double grip handle vs the single stem handle
if it could have been the single stem pot with double handled steamer i think we would use the base pot more
regardless for the price warranty and brand to match all our other pots this purchase was an easy one to makei use this pot for cooking items with liquid every week
the handles are strong enough for the full pot
do not use dishwasher for this pot as the water will stain the poti love this steamer
its a little smaller than i thought but maybe i dont know three quarts from two
which is very possible
lolso far i have steamed fish and vegetables in it and it has worked like a dreamive been using one of these for a while
i love it
bought another for my son
saw his setup and bought him one before he burns his house down
veggies taste better steamed as opposed to boiling
nice finish
the handles are one piece and do get hot
use oven mittsarrived on time well packaged
heavy bottom as advertised
good size for two peopleno complaints here  its a solid set and good for steaming cooking boiling and pretty space efficient too even in my cramped dormi steamed some frozen broccoli in it
it worked great
just put adequate water in the larger pot put in the steamer bowl cover the lid and keep an eye on it every few minutes
it took a few minutes to heat the water and steaming was done in about  min
healthy and easy way to improve your veggie intake
i also can use the larger pot for boiling tea water which is niceive had it for a few weeks and i love it
it holds and distributes heat perfectly and the steamer add on is great for veggiesneeded a universal pot for my duxtop induction burner
i knew this was rather small which is what i needed to feed one
i like to cook pasta and veggies
this works great as an all in one pot for that
as to quality you get what you pay for
it seems study enough but i can tell after a few uses that the  inside bottom of the pot with discolor and wear quicker than a higher quality pot
for the money this is a great pot just know you are not getting all cladwe use this pot for steaming corn on the cob and can easily fit three or four ears in the steaming basket
a little steam leaks out from between the basket and the pot
the bottom pot is a handy size for cooking spaghetti although as someone else noted you still need to use a collander to drain the water
we havent had any problems with the handles as someone else mentioned i think that reviewer must have been referring to a different item
the farberware classic handles are oven safe to  degrees if i remember correctly
it comes out of the dishwasher looking great
the pot bottom will scorch fairly easily when cooking certain foods as it is uncoatedthis pot is ok i like the thick bottom
it holds the heat well
the side walls are thin though
if not careful they can bend and warp
the handles are small
they can get hot if left on the stove for a whilemaybe a customer from cleveland oh was trying to cook more than one ostrich egg because this thing has lots of room  as any qt pot will  for many normal sized chicken eggs
this thing is for steaming anywaythis is a great steamer
the only thing i dont like about it is the lack of a longer handle to stay cool away from the flameburner
the small handles on this thing get very hot and after cooking my ostrich eggs i have never been able to grab it off the stove without pot holders
high quality definitely worth the priceupdated ive had this steamer pot since oct    years
 and it has steamed tons of broccoli artichokes and asparagus
no ostrich eggs yet
p  aside from discoloration of the insidebottom of the pan caused by forgetting to put water in the thing with the burner turned on high  oops
 its still in excellent condition and working greati have a set of the classic farberware ss pans probably  years old still work very nicely
stainless stays shiny and heats evenly
unfortunately i overheated my midsized pot by boiling it dry and it was literally cooked i should have let it cool down slowly the aluminum bottom separated from the stainless
new pot is same style and weight as the old pattern
i have had to replace handles on and off over the years they are still available
we use these pots on a commercial size range and you have to make sure the handle is off to the side
i could probably look into newer caphalon or millenium type never been a fan of teflonrecipient very pleased although it sits a little higher than previous versioni use a garmin etrex legend for sailing on san francisco bay
in particular for short ocean races out to the lightship and the inbay silver eagle race
once you have the waypoints programmed the gps is great for finding marksthe unit has a display where you can see direction to mark your current direction amount to turn right or left time to get to mark at what time oclock youll arrive at the mark and vmg to mark
all this information on one page  awesome
why first a gps automatically takes currents into consideration
if you race on sf bay or anywhere else with current youll know this is very useful
you can set a course toa reach mark in current and a be deadon while your competitors sail too high or too low second you can use the vmg function and your boats speedo to determine the actual current strength and whether youre in bad current or not third when crossing a tide line you can use the gps to figure out if the tideline is beneficial or not fourth the vmg function is useful for determining if youre sailing too high or too low off the wind fifth on a boring ocean race knowing the time to the mark takes some of the boredom off
this eta function is very accuratethe unit is fairly easy to use but not perfectly intuitive
as such you should play with it a bit before race day so you can give your skipper the info he needs on a moments noticethe unit is really small so it can be easily carried in a pocket of your jacket or foulies
we use our handheld gps all the time and dont use our boats builtin gps which can only be read from the nav table down below
in that sense this  unit beats a more expensive  gps unit simply because its handheldthe etrex legend has a map with buoys built in so you can turn channel markers into waypoints fairly easily
see below for what i mean by fairly easilyone winning transpac navigator that navigated to hawaii by using a garmin handheld gps unit
these devices are that good
of course he had a couple of backup gps units and a sextant just in case
on to the negatives its way too timeconsuming to enter waypoints into the unit
i wish i could just jam in some latlong coordinates on my pc and then synch those waypoints with my gps similar to how i can synch my pc with my palm
entering a single latlong coordinate into the unit takes maybe  minutes
if i could do it on a pc it would take onetenth the time turning channel markers into waypoints is hard
its hard to explain but youll be viewing a channel marker on the map press enter waypoint and youll enter your current latlong as the waypoint not the channel markers latlong
for my job im used to working with buggy software
but if you dont have patience with hardtouse software youll find this very annoying waypoints can only have about  characters
while this is better than some other units its not enough to store waypoints with names like south tower golden gate bridge or southampton shoal
this might seem like a big deal but on our boat well hand off the gps unit to whoevers not busy trimming a sail so they can call out our bearing to the next mark
its a hassle to explain to a new navigator that sth twr ggb means the south tower of the golden gate bridge
its kind of like the old days of dos where filenames could only be eight characters you can only go to one waypoint at a time
quite often well want to go to two waypoints
for example if youre sailing back from the lightship you want to aim for the south tower of the golden gate bridge but if you surf down a killer wave you dont want to sail south of mile rock
so the navigator has to constantly switch between these two waypoints and thats a hasslein summary great device once waypoints are entered entering waypoints is a major hassle garmin are you reading thisi have owned this unit for about  months now
i added on the mapsource topo maps because i use this gpsr for geocaching
wile this is not the top of the line gpsr it does the job for me with little problem at all
i have had some problems with getting signal a few times but no more problem than i have had with other gpsrs
over all i like this gpsr with the added mapsi purchased the etrex legend for the sole purpose of geocaching look it up on the web if you dont know what im talking about
i soon found it invaluable for driving finding my way around strange cities snowshoeing off trail and hikingthe legend is a compact easy to use unit
at its list price it has a great pricefeature ratio
the vista has more memory and a magnetic compass but i havent seen the need for more memory yet and my  compass works just fine and doesnt need batteriesat first i was concerned about the  meg of memory not being enough but ive downloaded the mapsource topo for northern nj southern ny to albany and much of soutern vermont with room to spare
on a trip to sacramento i was able to download the area around sac from san francisco to tahoeit comes with a base map that is very basic
it shows major roads rivers lakes and points of interest
i do recommend eventually getting one of the mapsource maps
if you are an outdoorsperson you should get the topo
if you travel often roads and recreation is the one to buythere are some issues with reception under heavy leaf cover but as i understand it this is a problem with most gpsrsthe clicstick is a great feature making navigating your way around the units features a breeze
the legend is durable ive dropped it many times and water resistant dropped it in water and i recommend it to anybody who wants a full featured unit with map capability and doesnt want to spend a bundleupdate  years laterafter over a year and a half of use i was still very happy with my legend
i found that there were no reception issues under heavy leaf cover as long as i held the gps the way the mfr
recommends which is flat with the face up to the sky
admittedly this is fine for a while but for long hikes it can be a pain so i purchased the neoprene carrier and i cliped it to the top of my packs shoulder belt to solve this
another way to improve reception in the woods is to turn it on well before you enter the woods so it knows where all the sats are
as long as i hold it correctly i rarely lose reception even under heavy leaf canopy and the few times i do i get it back within secondsive used my unit alongside magellan meridian and sportrak users as well as users of other garmin models and my reception was comparablethe one problem i had was with the rubber gasket that surrounds the unit
the glue degraded after a while and the gasket would slip
i sent it back to garmin and they repaired it for free as it was still under warranty
i think leaving the unit on the dashboard of a hot car in the summer may have contributed to thisi liked the legend so much that when i felt it was time to upgrade i purchased its big brother the vistaupdate  july this was a good unit it its day but gps technology has passed it by and the newer units are far better and dont cost much more
this is still in garmins line which is why i felt it was necessary to post this update
the newer etrex units any with an h in the model name have a high sensitivity receiver that gets great reception under trees and even indoors
most importantly some of them are just a few bucks more than this dinosaur
if you are considering this unit take a look at the etrex venture hc or etrex legend hcx
they have better reception a color display more map memory fast usb connections and more
this uses the old serial connection that most pc dont even come with any more and the reception doesnt come close to that of the legend hcx and venture hcfirst off this is the best gps unit i have ever used
this little unit will do it all  navigate base map map expansion trip odometer waypoints etc
this is the perfect mesh for the hiker biker and geocacher
unfortunately it falls short while in the automobile in these areas  display size is too small
i have this unit mounted less than  feet from me while driving and it is still very hard to read the screen
the customizable options for the mapnavigate screen is nice but what good is it if you cant read it
some fault probably goes to the car interior layout however text enlargement would have been a nice feature
rather than glancing at the unit for a quick update i found myself staring at it far too long for safety purposes just to figure out where i was
tempermental to heat inside the car
we were in breckenridge co and the outside temperature was around  degrees and i will put the inside temp of the vehicle at around  prior to the ac kicking in
the unit is mounted on top of the dash to get a clear view of the sky and it was having an issue that i can only speculate was caused by the heat in the vehicle
every  minutes or so the unit would display a message saying that external power had been lost and to push a button to use battery power
well no external power was ever used and only batteries were installed
no the batteries werent low in power so i had to continually click the stick to revert to battery power
not good for safe drivingoverall for hiking and biking this is the best one so farive owned three etrexs from this series ranging from the entrylevel yellow unit to the topoftheline vista
when the vista got lost i didnt want to spend as much replacing it so i bought the legendbasically the legend is the vista without the electromagnetic compass or airpressure altitude indicator and mb vs  of ram
on the plus side the legend has longer battery life which is a real considerationthe only feature i miss from the vista is the electromagnetic compass a very useful thing to have when youre trying to triangulate on a bearing and projecting waypoints out from a fixed bearing
the mb of map memory is plenty you can cover half of california with itfirmwarewise id like to see waypoint names longer than just  character with lower case for the benefit of roundtripping your descriptions from products like delormes xmap and topo usaan excellent device durable and compact  tracks great even on the front dash of your car
worth  stars reallyi bought the legend from amazon in august  after a lot of research
it was and still is the best value in a small gps
i also bought the topo cds several months later
i took the legend everywhere and used it almost dailythe unit recently had intermittent failures it is out of warranty and it is being retired
i had no issues with reception acquisition time reading the display battery life or using it left handed
the topo software could use an update but it makes the legend much more useful
i bought a bike mount definitely get one of those if you cyclethe new color units have a usb connection the legend uses a serial cable
not a big deal but not all laptops have serial ports so consider that before you buy
a usbserial converter is available for a rather steep  almost half the cost of the legend
data transfer isnt fast but you have to be chronically impatient to care about thatthe first intermittent failure on my unit was the joystick it would not switch in the left direction among other things i could not select routes
that was annoying
the second was a pattern of thin lines across the display the third was a hard failure a black display on boot up
the black display rendered the legend completely useless during a  day trip in the adirondacks fortunately not on the trail
i almost tossed it but when we got home it began functioning againanother intermittent problemdont ever rely on one of these things for navigation in the wilderness the product quality is inadequate
you will be foolishly testing the aerospace corollary of murphys law whatever can go wrong willand at the worst possible time by depending on it for essential navigation
carry a compass and map or be prepared to get lost and die after the legend failsmy advice to those considering purchase is to go for it but keep your receipt because theres a good chance it will break and need warranty service
after the warranty its an expendable
forget about factory repairs those are im replacing the legend with a vista i really dont expect better quality but i do like the bigger memory and the altitude profile display will be fun to play with
the most practical decision would have been to get another legend but thats rather boring
the magellans are getting better but they dont have the screen resolution and ergonomics of the garminsthe etrex color units are quite nice but way too expensive
when the vista is broken and out of warranty maybe the price will drop and color will be my replacement
or perhaps another manufacturer will develop a higher quality gps with the features size and display of the garminoverall id recommend the legend
its a good value provided you have the common sense to understand and manage its limitationsi have used this unit for  years and traveled cross country with it twice
first you get what you pay for
if you want a nice display and easy to use in the car go spend 
reception in a car is tough having a sunroof helps and there is no option for an external antenna
nonrechargable batteries only last about a day of continuous usage so either turn it on and off as needed buy a car adapter or lots of spares
the greyscale display is hard to read at night or under lowlight conditions at least for my older eyesbut with all of that i love it
it was great when i first moved to a large city out west since it had a built in map of all the major roads
i kept it in my car for months just so i could always be sure to get home
you can quickly mark locations as you drive by holding down the joystick just remember to add a name that makes sense later its dangerous while you are driving
i used it to drive cross country twice and have used it on numerous trips to large cities
the built in maps are good enough that i got around without having to download anything
find a good web site that gives latlong for addresses and you can probably get around just fine
i have used it several times without an atlas or map handy except in the trunk just in case to get around large cities that i had never been to before and once travel across country
but it is safer with a navigator who watches it because of the small displayit does shut off without warning i think it is due to loose battery connections though as it tends to happen mostly when being bounced around like on a bike
i am rough on it and have not had any problems beyond it shutting off
there are several free software programs you can use to uploaddownload waypoints and tracks so dont spend any money unless you really want toafter looking at several different levels of garmins vista summit geko venture and several magellans i decided on this not because its a real important piece of equipment that my life would depend on but something new and interesting to do ie
geocaching traveling and so oni first looke at getting a gps handheld a few years ago and at that time they were  bucks for a basic model w not nearly as many features as this
the reason i chose the legend over the other models and brands was price  rebate mb of built in memory preloaded roadmapsthose three pretty much sum up the legend
it may not be the smallest thing out there but i was very impressed with the gadget
when i first took it outside it took about  minutes to load up and get aclimated and track the satellites and do whatever else it does
and after it did that the accuracy estimation went from  feet down to between  feet and that is what i usually get for a readingyesterday was the first time it picked up the waas satelite and i saw the accuracy at  feet
for some reason i dont get the waas connection very much but i give that to that i read there are two of the buggers floating up there for the moment and they are both over the equator and over opposite hemispheres and being in pa it might be a little hard to see it well at the horizon but anyway even without then a  foot accuracy is plenty for geocachingmy friend has an older magellan  one that i originally looked at buying a while ago and he held mine and turned it on and saw the accuracy and the below other cool functions and its three place second division reading compared to his  he loved it
he even told me that the next trip he took he got mad at his because he count get better reception he threw it in the woods and was going to buy one like minei read some people have trouble with reception
i never had a problem mine picks up between  sats while i am indoors
the accuracy while inside is around  feet but who cares i inside rightthe other feature i love on this are the trip computer it calculates present speed average speed altitude gps sat based not asensor like the summit compass trip odometer it even split your stopped time and moving time during the trip
ever want to know how much time you spend at red lights going to work
this will tell you
and the best is the real time map
it plots your route along the map as it scrolls with your vehicle or paththe reason for  stars and not  mearly because you have to spend so much more money for the small streets that need to be loaded into it from the companys cd
but the cool thing is that i can plug it into a laptop that is running microsofts streets program and it will communicate to that program so i dont really need to load the cd into the gpsgreat gadget for a great price especially with the  rebate when i bought itadditional plan on spending some time in trying to figure out how to enter waypointsplaces and using them to navigate not to mention the time involved in entering coordinates manually w the click stick or panning the map to enter themthis is a great entry level gps with reasonable features for the weekend user
i might have overlooked it but my son bought one last summer and loved it
my conclusion is that it is a great value
the serial cable included may be a putoff to someone expecting usb but it works reliably and setup was a snap
startup scans are pretty quick if the view is unobstructed
the  mb memory sounds a bit short compared to the  models but i found thats more than adequate for most trips
the display resolution is good for the price its not the supercrisp color but its fine for a day in the field
like every electronic system it takes some getting used to the controls but after you do i found it instinctive to use
are there things id like to improve you betcha
but for the price its great
couple this with a program like easygps and you have a great system for the casualtosemiserious useri had a previous version of the garmin in its old format
it was bullet proof but not really very helpful
i decided to update and this seemed to be a good compromise between just the lattitude and longitude gps and the complete onstar type systemit works well acquires the necessary coverage much quicker than the prior unit and seems accurate and reliableit does come only with major road coverage
while that is a great improvement over the original units you will still need a city map unless you buy the city streets software
the software seems pricy since it is a good percentage of the price of the unit
you might be better off getting one of the models that already has the city streets software included as the overall price is probably lesshowever it works the colored screen is much easier to see and for overall knowing where you are what decent sized roads to take to get from city to city it is a good productyou can see other positive reviews of the etrex legend here so i wont rehash them
the short story is that the legend is a pretty decent gps unit that works pretty wellthe base map included in the legend only shows major highways and major streets
this is similar to the maps you get from a car rental agency
its perfectly fine for doing rough navigation from city to city
at first i tried using rand mcnallys streetfinder and tripmaker deluxe on my laptop with the legend
the setup worked but having to deal with the serial cable and using a laptop in the car was not very practicalafter ive had my legend a while i had a chance to borrow and use a vista
the owner of the vista upgraded it with detailed streetdetail maps from garmins mapsource metroguide usa cd  the detailed street map is a really nice feature  especially because you can look up addresses
having such a detailed map in a small portable device is a delight
i decided to get the metroguide for myselffrom my usage comparison i found two things missing in the legend compared to the topend etrex vistafirst the legend has only  mb of expansion memory instead of the  mb in the vista
this turns out to be a big issue for me as i would like to have a complete metro guide of the greater los angeles area
with  mb i could only fit  of the  metroguide map sets that i would have liked
this means i am missing coverage of a large section stretching roughly from compton to long beach to lynwood to cerritos to irvine that i would have wanted
in contrast the vista held all of greater los angeles area plus some san francisco san diego and las vegassecond the vista has sensors for barometric altitude and magnetic compass heading
the legend estimates altitude via gps and calculated heading based on your travel speed vector
if you are a trailhiker these sensors improve your navigationused asis from the factory ie only the american basemaps the legend is perfectly fine and i was quite happy with iti could live without the vistas sensorsbut having hit the  mb memory limit trying to load los angeles i would definitely go with the vista nowthe metroguide maps sizes of other cities may or may not be an issue for you
go to the garmin website and use their mapsourec map viewer and count the number of yellow squares youll need to cover you area of interest
each square roughly represents between k to  mb of data with the smaller dense squares being toward the  mb to mb size
youll find that most of the big cities will have enough squares to easily exceed the  mb of the legendthis is a large improvement from the cheaper etrex models as it has a built in map much more memory and comes with a serial cable to enable downloading from a computer
the map is not fantastic but it does give you a decent idea where you are within a mile or so
geographic features are recognizable at that scaleit picks up satellites reasonably quickly but seems hard on batteries compared to other handhelds ive owned
on  fully charged nimh aa cells i can get about  hours of usei was given one of these units as a gift and i have been working with it for a couple of years now
i upgraded to a more capable and more expensive unit but i still use the etrex legend frequently
it is a fine entrylevel gps receiver gpsr for most applicationsfirst off this is not a large and bulky unit but rather it fits nicely in the hand or in a front pocket if desired
it is lightweight and the curvesshape do not make it uncomfortable to usein spite of being fairly small the display is large enough to read clearly and the controls are fairly easy to use
there are a few buttons on the side of the unit as well as the click stick that facilitate navigating the menus and displays but it is a good idea to read through the manual to get some idea of how these work
i took the unit out of the box and had no idea what to do or how to use it but once i leafed through the manual it made good senseit takes some time to acquire the satellite fixes it needs to facilitate navigation
on average it takes about  seconds to acquire a lock which may or may not be acceptable to some people
for my purposes it is fine
that said it does not take a lot to lose the fix  heavy canopy cover or even obstructing the reception by holding the unit with ones hand over the internal antenna can cause it to lose track after which it cuts off to conserve battery power
so this unit performs best under open sky or light cover though i have had success even in very heavy coverthe accuracy on this unit is quite good
i have seen it accurate to within  feet which is excellent
it usually holds its accuracy fairly well though sometimes it struggles when there is magnetic disturbance or heavy cover
it have difficulty in the car unless it is on the dashboard or near a windowi use this unit almost exclusively for geocaching and it has proven to be excellent for that purpose most of the time
it can hold up to  points and it has functions for managing waypoints
that said my family and i connected it to the computer on a trip one time and used it to navigate from virginia to indiana and it did a nice job of keeping up with the roads
also the batteries lasted from washington dc to indianapolis under continuous use about  hoursthe base map within is fine for general navigation but it is not very helpful for pinpointing
it will get you down the interstate and to major roads but thats about it
still for a unit in its price range thats reasonable
theres  mb of memory in the unit so more detailed maps can be loadedthis unit has been dropped stepped on knocked off desks sat on and otherwise abused and it continues to workthere are more powerful gpsrs that have more functionality have a better display or have better reception in areas where this unit fails
those units cost more
this is an entry level unit and it does quite well in that roleafter getting lost for the first and the last time i decided to invest in the gps
garmin legend seemed like a good piece due to possible upgrades  megs of space price and having a lot of maps build in
i use it both on the water and land
so far it is doing fine being as accurate as it can be
if you are a kayaker like me you will really love the speeddistance measurements you can use this gps to track your way around or set most crucial spots like bay entry or camp site as your way point and than when you coming back just set the unit to lead you there
most of the landing points are marked already with the included software
unit feels very fragile my window was scratched after few minutes in my pocket  i really hate using it with my left hand plus whats up with the color
and  minutes start up time is also its weak point
but at the end legend gets the job doneive had mine for i think over  years nowwhen i first got it it tended to turn off at just the slightest little jarring or shock like when i set it down on a hard surface
it turns out the battery contacts where not strong enough to remain conntacted with the batteries under all conditionsi sent it back to garmin and they shipped it back in working condition it doesnt turn off when jarred
but when you open the battery case the contacts looks like someone took a pair of pliers and rebent them several times to make them contact the batteries better  i could have done that
of course its just aesthetics but when your brand new gps has battery contacts that look like a third grader bent it up with pliers its a disappointment everytime you change batteriesrecently the power cord connector on my garmin v dc adaptor started loosing contact so that the gps will shut itself off just like the battery contact problemthe gps is great but whoever is designing garmins electrical connectors and contacts is really bad at hisher jobfantastic unit for hunting hiking christmas tree searching etc
we hike in the mountains and you can take waypoints as you hike then go to google earth and look up exactly where you were
works the other way too
input your waypoints and then tell the unit to navigate to it
check the accuracy of your speedometer
fun to use geocaching toothere are things i dont like
it has the older chipset that loses signal easily
i have to put the unit on my dashboard because it loses signal in any seat of my car
i also wish it converted coordinates to decimal easily but it only uses standard gps coordinates
i have to do a conversion each time from google earths coordinates
there are some roadmaps but only major streets in most cities
dont use this for address navigation because the maps are not very detailed
wished it used a usb connection to a computer but its using older serial port so many new laptops wont interface to it
also you have to move around for compass to worki have been using this model for some time it is very good for hiking and biking especially in open places but not comfortable to be used in a car while drivingfor its price it is a great dealok first off this is  what kind of new electronics uses a serial cable
lets get real garminnow i should note that i downloaded easygps and loaded waypoints for geocaching through the serial cable without a hitch and zero configuration
nice little programgood news is you can buy a converter which will allow you to use usb for your laptop
this cost me  bucks
do a google and you should find several optionsa friend of mine has a vista
you should know that the legend and the vista use the same antenna so you are not upgrading your reception if you buy a more expensive model
our reception and navigation was identical
the higher end ones really dont do much for usability
they only give you some niffty features like knowing the sunset time elevation etc
really these arent things that will help you navigate
color doesnt seem to be useful either at least as far as geocaching goesthe backlight is great at night no problems whatsoever seeing the screenthe only reason you would want to upgrade from the etrex is if you want a gps for road navigation or to get a better antennai have had this gps in very thick cover in pa and in my car and have never had a problem with getting satellitesso in my opinion if your looking at the vista or this go with this if you want to spend extra cash then get something with a better antennafor hikers and geocachers looking for a low cost gps unit this is the one for you
i purchased the etrex legend after a recommendation from a friend and im glad i didused on some long hikes the unit tracks routes well and creating waypoints is very user friendly when compared with other hand helds
slight signal loss during heavy tree cover but nothing i wouldnt expect from a low cost productif you have money to burn then investing in a more robust unit maybe the way to go for diehard gadget fans
but if you are shopping on a budget this device will be plenty for what you need
i wont hike without itthis is my second gps to own
most of the reviews will give pros and cons most seem to be true
overall this is a good unit and very accurate
dont let the cons keep you from this uniti have so many great memories geocaching with the etrex legend from  these things were notorious for weak satellite reception in forested areas and also for the rubber band around the outside coming off over time
ahh the memoriesregardless of its minor inadequacies it is a simple straightforward and reliable gpsr
nothing fancy it just works every time you need it to
i actually prefer the black and white lcd screens on these units over the newer color displays  easier to read in sunlight
has enough memory to store a decently large map area as welli really really enjoyed using this gpsr
it makes for the perfect geocaching unit imo
it doesnt have any of the paperless caching features or cellularwifi data capabilities which i feel make geocaching too easy anywayhighly recommendedif you are reading this you are probably considering the legend for its combination of price  features along with the overall user satisfaction
thats why i chose it anyhow
before i bought i too read all of these amazon reviews and decided this gps would be the best one for the money
 at the time i bought it  i read the reviews of the magellans but they were pretty mixed and their customer service never got any kudos
it seemed like only  of their customers were happy outofthebox
i was initially attracted to them because they are said to retain satellite lock better than these lowend garmins
but then i read that they have lower resolution displays and that theyre a lot bigger and heavier
a shame since some of the medium magellens had expandable sd memoryback to the garmin legend bad news first reception could be a bit stronger
if you follow garmins directions and hold the receiver flat under an unobstructed sky you will always have excellent reception a good lock and good accuracy
waas brings it from  ft down to under  ft when you are covered by waas enabled satellites  but the signal gets degraded easily
for instance if you dont hold it flat as you walk around outside the accuracy generally drops from  ft to  ft  no big deal really
in the car mounted to the dash there are never any problems
check ebay for mounting accessories unless you want to get gouged for the namebrand onesthe features are great and are pretty easy to learn
the clik stik menu navigation is great
the display is very sharp and has great resolution
i cant believe how good it looks
not that this matters much but i also like the transluscent blue plastic
i havent tried any of the external software yet as it is pricey at around 
garmin is crazy to ask this much for it
do they think people dont realize how much it is going to cost
if they priced their extra maps at about  per country instead of  they would sell a lot more of everythingi have a friend at work who bought a legend over a year ago
he just sold it on the bay and got most of his money back and put it towards a vista c  he says the reception is drastically more reliable
he said that in his bathroom with a roof overhead he was still able to pick up satellites and get good accuracy
with his legend he complained about losing satellite reception when he put it in a chest pocket of his jacket while riding dirtbikes in the desert
he likes that there is  mb of memory instead of   he likes the display
he also makes about x more money than i do so he can afford a gps that costs x as much as mine
theyre around  vs i went for a  mile hike in the forest preserve today and had it hung around my neck with the supplied strap
it worked great even though it was about  degrees farenheit today
the lcd was getting pretty slow but everything worked very wellsome notes if youre also considering the entry level yellow etrex the builtin usa basemap of the legend is useful but it doesnt cover down to street level
realize that the basic etrex doesnt have this so it will not be very useful for the car
it has major roads
generally anything with a state or interstate  will be on it
if you plan to use it only for outdoor activities where you will never need a map topographic or street the basic etrex has the same hardware but with a smaller lcd screen
i know someone who has a yellow etrex and i think her main complaint is that it doesnt have the clik stik
she is an avid hiker and geocacher and when she enters waypoints manually since it doesnt have pc interface capabilities she doesnt bother to name them since it take so much longer without the clikstik
she just leaves them numberedif you want more information check out the groundspeak forums
please do an honest search of the posts that are there before asking questions as newbies show up and ask the same questions week after week
someone has already asked your question believe mebottom line if you have the dough buy one of the higherend garmins for the reception and memory
if not you will be very happy with this legend as long as you realize its limitationsi purchased this unit as a gift for a male friend
he really liked it and was excited about using it
he loves it and says its very accurate for use around his home area
i dont have specific details about the specs on this item but i can report that it was a well likedused giftfirst let me say that although i have purchased  garmin etrex legends i use the garmin colorado t
so why all of the legendsi love geocaching
and like many of the things that we love we want to pass it on to others
after tons of research i have chosen the legend as the perfect gps for beginning geocachers
i have given them to friends family and boy scout troops
yes there are gps receivers on the market with more features but at a much higher priceif you are new to geocaching or are looking for a gpsr for someone who is the garmin etrex legend gets my recommendationi wish it had an actual compass as opposed to gps derived headings
if you stop moving it can get confused what way you are truly heading
we use this for geocaching and had to set it to just go north up and then use a magnetic compass to make sure were oriented right
overall though i am rather pleased with it and give it a high four stars
its sturdy has been faithful and reliable and really is pretty comfortable to use and navigate withi received this device as a gift  i had originally received one without a map display
i returned it for one with a map display and used it for and extended period as the primary gps for my boat in floridarecommendation  id buy this if you want this particular combination of features
but to get the features there are large compromises in performancein this review i will mention the gecko  quest and vista c  these are other units made by garmin
i own a  and a quest early version but have not yet used the other unit or the later questsdriving  when placing it on the dash i am forced to compromise between seeing the display and aiming the antenna outside of the car for reception since the antenna is in the body of the unit
the effect depends on the design of the car how big the windows are i would guess
on the quest the antenna flips up and it does not have this problem
sunlight reflecting off the front face of the unit into the drivers eyes is sometimes a problem and aiming to unit to fix this can compromise reception andor readability
the battery life is short enough that i find a car plug necessary at additional cost
however the battery life can be extended by disabling features
it is not able to find automobile routes such as the vista c or quest can do
i find that when i compare the cost of a vista plus maps and plug with say a quest where these are included they are pretty much the same
so i would not get a vista if the only planned use was extensive route finding while driving
the quest is a much better solutionhiking  i live in california
here there are grassy hills to tree covered hills
i find that my main area of concern is finding my location when in the trees since in other areas i can navigate with a map the gps does not rule out needing a map even with the topo map cds and my eyes
i have been comparing the reception of the vista with my gecko  and find that the  gets noticably stronger signals
this results in the  getting faster better positions and getting positions where the vista will not such as in moderate tree cover which is where id really want a position
i find that ecompass and ealtimeter do not outweigh the fact i cannot get a position lock
so if your only planned use is hiking id get something with better reception and a silva ranger style compassi am finding that when i switch onoff the compass feature to save battery life the compass is a noticable drain the software in the unit crashes and it shuts off
a pain but not a fatal onehowever all the preceeding being said if you want a single unit that can get you to a park then navigate around the park and back to the car this unit is cheaper that two separate gps units for each aplication
and it nicely fits into a pocket for hiking
i also hear that geocachers like them since they need to get close to the cache in the car and then take the unit out of the car to find the cache
i could see this unit being nice in that applicationthis is a very nice piece of kit but getting a bit long in the tooth
it did exactly what i wanted it to do until i saw the vista cx
sold my vista to my dad and bought the cx  well worth the extra money for the extra usability
all the annoyances on the old vista model are fixed on the cx greyscale lcd with feeble backlight compared to a color daylight readable lcd  the brighter it is the sharper it gets
 long thin lcd cf the squarer one on the cx rs serial port vs usb port which also powers the unit map redraws are slow  faster cpu on the cx no autorouting on the vista  its on the cx but you need the right maps no sounds on the vista for route change reminders  cx goes beep in a variety of waysthe vista is all around good unit
it does have its short comings but in general is one of the best hand gps unit out therethe problem with small hand gps units are usually lack of memory lack of battery life and poor screen resolutionsthe vista does not have the memory size problems
at  megabytes of memory you can store a large amount of maps
in my case i uploaded all of california washington and large chunks of oregon in high detail and still had room left overthe screen resolution is not bad
you might think it is a bit small but this is a hand unit not a dashboard car unit that has the luxuary of surface area
they can not make the screen any larger without making the whole unit larger
the pixel count is also fairly large making the images on the screen pretty crispthe battery life is also not that bad
if you turn on all the features of the unit you can drain the  aa batteries in about  or  hours
if you turn on the power saver mode and turn off other features you can live without you can get about  or  hours of use out of the unit
i do not think that is too bad but it might annoy you
to me it is not a big deal since i have rechargable batteries and regular batteries are cheap and easy to carryanother nice things about the vista is that you can navigate all the features of the unit while it is in your left hand
some people do not like this but i think it is cool since i can use my left hand pretty well
i notice some people are a bit clumy with their left hand if they are right handed
i have no problems thoughthe satellite tracking is good
some people claim it does not track well in deep woods but since i am urban explorer i do not have those problems
i guess if you were a hunter you might see that as a big negitive but i have a garmin vista to keep me out of the deep woodsif you get a garmin vista you should also get the carring case to keep it protected and also get the datacigarette power adapter cable
when you get into the car you can hook this up and not use the batteriersyou will also need to buy one of the garmin cdrom maps
they tend to be expensive but the maps that come with vista garmin are really poor and are of no usethe other thing i notice is not with the unit itself but the company that makes it
garmin does a very good job of supporting the vista and its like brothers legend trek camo
firmware updates are released often and do fix bugs that crop up
the manual is quite good and very useful
there are a number of websites that are very helpful for the first time gps owner so do not worry about support youll get it from garmin or someone else who owns a garminthe goodssmall sizegood screen resolutionlarge memoryplenty of features for the average trekker of any kindbattery life can be long if managed properlywater proof but does not floatgreat support from garminsmall sizethe badsthe maps that comes with it are worthlessbattery life can be poor if not managed properlysatellite tracking might be bad under heavy tree coverthis product did exactly what we needed and provided the data that we needed
be prepared to click around a lot
options are not as obvious as other gps units but the satellite view while streaming data to the computer were exactly the features we neededit has everything in
barometer altimeter compassi would have delightfully rated it  stars but the only problem i had with my vista is that it eats out batteries very fast despite of its builtin settings for different types of batteries
i use it exclusively for snowmobiling and it works great especially if you had a v outlet in your sled which i dont
if youre looking for a gps loaded with features get the vista
but i prefer using third party software to communicate with it
garmin mapsource is a wate of money
i got a version which simply wanted me to call garmin support everytime i tried to chage description of a trackive had my vista for several years now and find it invaluable for hiking driving and touring foreign countries
i usually download the mapsource maps for whichever area of the us or europe im going to and its saved me many a wrong turn
it works surprisingly well in urban environments and i use it to navigate cities on foot
 meg of memory can store a lot of maps i can easily fit all of the metroguide new england states info in itthe battery lifetime is good but not as good as some other units
turning off the magnetic compass helps considerablyi do find the screen a little hard to read sometimes but it crams a lot of information into a small space
all in all its a very nice unit and i wouldnt be without minethe most use i get out of it is reading ebooks
however my biggest qualm is the screen quality
in direct sunlightbrightlight the screen is easily readable
with the backlight on in a dimly lit area text on screen is also fairly nice
however anything in between and the screen becomes almost impossible to read
the convenience of lugging this pda around and reading my stuff is a big plus
listening to mps is a plus also and the windows audio format is indistinguishable in quality
however what annoys me is plastic thing u have to slide over ur pocketpc to use ur cf cards
makes it twice as bulky
once i start using it  the cf card i cannot fit it into its leather case
kind of annoying since if u decide to walk around w ur pocketpcnow mp player in ur pocket the buttons can be accidently pressedi am satisfied with this product
the fact i can synchronize w money  is nice alsoi bought this pda and it have all what i need i can read ebooks schedule my time manage my contacts listen to mp connect to internet with the targus modem that i boughtthe only problem that i found if i can call that a problem is that is monochromatic well if we go deep this is not a problem but when compared with the other ones that are in color well you say anyway if youre thinking in buying this pda its a good deal while ive not always been a huge fan of compaqs desktop systems they have really gotten it right with the ipaq
having owned and sold a palm v i was frustrated that the applications and tools on the palm systems are not as good as the ms applications im used to running on my desktop machine
sure the phonebookcalendaremail on the palm are compatible with outlook etc but its not the same as running the same applications
the ipaq is lightweight and easy to use
i do not need to have a color display on such a small device  the handheld in my opinion is an extension of the pc not a replacement
at this price the ipaq is definitely a value for anyone who wants a portable and userfriendly version of their desktoplaptop machines handyi have had other handhelds this is by far the best its fast and very nice looking
i bought it with the past pocket pc os and upgrade it to pocket pc  it works perfect
as far as i can tell this is the only one that can support the upgrade because of the intel risc processor it uses
for me this was the best option in order no to carry my laptop aroundi really like this product and technology
the ipaq  has most of the same features as the higher priced pocketpcs at a great price
even though this has the monochrome screen the display is very readable and clear
the compact flash jacket is a nice addition which gives you options such as cf memory and network cardsthe only cons i have found is that this unit has mb of memory which will limit you to how much software can be installed
also some programs will not work with this model due to memorydisplay limitationsso if you want a pocketpc that wont break the bank the ipaq  fits the billi bought this so that i could retrieve files from some  mb zip disks
it was easily installed on windows xp and opens zip disks but although it installed on my windows  machine it wont open any zip disksive upgraded my rating from  to   it turns out take two  was the primary culprit with the slow boot and was the sole offender for the need to have a zip disk inserted to start windows  at all
anyone using roxios easy cd creator platinum  that installed take two should visit the website to download and install the  and s updates
i also found that once i unplugged my com homeconnect pc camera from my entrega  port usb hub i didnt stay on the boot screen for  minutes
time to dump entrega and find newer higherpowered hubs i guessthe zip drive is an ancient relic in terms of technology but our firm has clients that sometimes bring in documents on this hardware
we purchased this unit to retrieve older documents for business
works with windows xp and we hope it works on windows i love this drive very easy to install windows auto detects and installs quite nicely
being usb akes it very easy to travel with and can be used anywhere and on any computer with a usb portnow the downsidethe disks are quite expensive about x more than a cdrw for way less storageif you are hoping to use the drive to restore systems files from at startup forget it you will need the serial port version of the zip drive to do thatthis is an excellent solution for someone who needs to share files between multiple computersfor pure backup of data however a cdrw is a more cost effective solutionpurchased with a mb flash card which gives about  lowcompression jpeg x images
im very happy with the image quality but it takes the camera about  seconds to focus amp shoot from initial shutter press which is too slow for my style
however you can prefocus by holding the shutter down halfway which reduces the shoot time to about  secthe autobracket white balance priority and full manual and flash intensity features are welcome and necessary for many shots but it takes a lot of button pushing to access them in the menusi dont have much use for the quicktime movie feature the x resolution is too low to be useful and it eats ram like crazyif you buy this camera i highly recommend you also purchase the olympus cla lens adapter tube and a mm filter for same to get some armor on the delicate zoom lensi love the reviews by people that have purchased this camera
i just ordered it along with a bundled kit that contains a mb card charger case and batteries
the only unfortunate part is that i found mine through zdnet for  lesslike my review for the m i will say that the m would be an excellent gift for the nongadget consious nonpower packed hungry individuals
its an excellent entry level palm
at its price is quite a bargin
its main difference is that it has  times the memory
trust me you will be quite pressed to max mb
unless you use avantgo or fireviewer you wont even come close to filling mb up
the m also comes with a cradle instead of a cord
theres also a mobile kit includedas a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any pda
dont believe the pocketpc ads or even the palm ads
talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who arent on palms or microsofts payroll
unfortunately they will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to knowgood luck
overall again this is a good introductory palm for those who dont have any type of pda
again it really depend on your needs in a pda
if all you need is a place to write telephone numbers keep a calendar a to do list and maybe a few games this would be adequate
however if you need to view documents ebooks web clippings spreadsheets and even listen to music you might want to go another direction
also be prepared to part with a few more dollarsi found a neat trick that i thought id pass oni noticed that in the builtin apps such as the to do list memopad and even the datebook if you pull down the options menu youll find the selection quotphone lookupquotthis is useful if you create say a to do list item that says quotcall john smith about current accountquot using this feature you can pop over to your phone book look up johns number and then cancel out of the phone book app and go back to the to do list memopad or whateverhowever there is a little trick to this that makes it work much better
the trick is to position the cursor after the persons name you want to look up before you tap on quotphone lookup
this way you will be popped right to the persons name in the database instead of having to look further from therei got my m as a christmas present
i did not know if i would really use such a device so i never bought one for myself
now that i have one i really like it
it is simple to use and synchs up with my email and my contact manager
and it only took me a few minutes to use it like a pro
now that i have started using it so much my only concern is the build quality
it looks very flimsy
i am afraid that over the long haul it will fail
one problem i already had was with the batteries
it uses normal aaa alkaline batteries
the batteries must have gotten shook up just slightly enough to lose contact in my pocket and i lost all my data
i took the back cover off and jiggled the batteries and it worked fine again but i had to reload my data
very annoying
my coworker has an ibm hand held
it has a much more rugged metal case and uses a rechargeable lithium battery pack
however his was more than twice as expensive and it has mostly the same electronic features
bw display m memory etcthis palm is a very good value for its price
i am a broke college student and can not afford a  dollar pda
if all you want is a place to write down your notes in an organized manor this is great
there are tons of free software for it and def get this one over the palm m
it might be  bucks more but the mb is worth it and it comes with a  dollar value cradle
the m doesnt come with that and it is a lot easier to hot sync to your computer with it
the software is great
except i wish you could change the font style more
and the backlit screen isnt very good
i am very happy with my pda and i think you will be toounlike the leather product offered by targus
this one actually has enough room to hold the keyboard and a pda
i own a jornada  and it fits both nicely
the leather version that i had purchased directly from targus wouldnt hold the keyboard and that made absolutely no sense
i would to see more room however to store other accessories such as a modem cardcase holds palm vx and palmbranded keyboard quite snugly
id be hesitant to put velcro on a  pda so nonpalm owners should stay away from this case
velcro on an ipaq is just plain tackytwo small complaints first my palm is held at slight angle
the seam with the builtin stylus peg is slightly off center
really not a big deal
second  learn to not tuck the strap in real tight because the palm will stay on if already activated when the case is closed
doesnt happen often
also not a big dealthat said i think this is a real steal for  i killed a palm iii with no case before i got my vx and i like the protection this case offersthis is pretty good for storing the pda and keyboard but not functional for everyday use
i just use it to protect my pda screen in my bags and to have a place to keep the keyboard so i know where it isi have had this camera for several months now and i am extremely happy with it
i find that this camera is easier to use than i expected but that is not the same as simple
dont lose the manual
nevertheless most of what you need to do often resolution macro etc are easy to remember
a negative is that the display can be difficult in bright light
plusses are excellent optics fine color and edge rendering light weight and availability of storage media at a reasonable price
the usb connection makes it very easy to move my photos from the camera to a pc and relatively fast
this is a high quality camera in every wayi started with a olympus z i think
x still printed great x on my photosmart
now ive got  mega pixels and i cant wait to print one of those at that sizethings i lovequality of photos high resolution photossecond to capture the action
i took some pictures of my daughter whipping a bubble wand around in a circle
with a regular mm camera i would have wasted  shots using the same approach
i got some spectacular action shots which you can see at  useridjpaynetakes great indoor pictures
no problems with redeye and i am pretty sure i havent even been using redeye reduction
the nikon coolpix cannot be used for indoor pictures if you believe the reviewsquicktime movies are a great way to share an experience with loved ones
i use the x i think resolution with sound
 seconds of that produces about a mb mov file which quicktime  can read and play back
in order to share that with my family on the east coast i had to fork our  to apple to get the quicktime pro which allowed me to compress that movie
that quality goes down but i was able to produce a decent movie with a size of mb instead of the original mb this was a  second movie
awesome
the fact that sound is part of the movie is critical
the nikon coolpix  doesnt have sound with its moviesi copy the images to my laptop with a pcmcia card
i just plop the smartmedia card into the pcmcia card thats already inserted and the removeable disk appears in windows explorer and i can copy megabytes of datasecond onto my hard drive
dont waste your time with the flashpath floppy adapteri manage my images with thumbsplus by cerious software 
for  this is a dream come true for photo management software
in addition to all the image manipulations you could ever want it also allows you to a apply a similar operation to a whole set of images at once b associate keywords with each image c allows you to associate userdefined fields to each image
the result of which you can perform queries of the form find all imagines with mom dad and madeline in hawaii out doors in 
up pops a slice of your image database in seconds
sure beats combing through photo albums that i never get around to putting together anyway
i like the panoramic mode very much
the software does a good job of stitching the images together for you
you need the olympus card though  the feature is disabled without that cardthe camera is nice and smallthings i dont likethe lens cap doesnt automatically come off so you must remember to remove it before you turn the camera on or else you will hear a grinding noise as the camera lens tries to extend
i am already over thisyou cannot zoom when you make quicktime movies if you are recording sound
when you try to zoom it does a digital zoom instead of an optical zoom
why botherthe speed at which the camera copies images and movies to and from the smartmedia is less than inspiring
so you will take a quicktime movie for  seconds and then wait another  seconds while the movies is copied to the smart media
then when you want to play it you will wait another  seconds while its copied back into the mb internal buffer
i usually just play the movie back on my laptop which can copy tofrom the smartmedia in seconds actually it just plays the movie directly off the smart media cardpreviously i had mentioned i had trouble with mb smart media cards but it turned out to be the card
i wasnt able to determine the brand of that card otherwise i would warn yall about ityou can go to  and look for albums from useridjpayne to see some of the photos i have taken with the camera
the pictures are all taken in the highest resolution and most of them are taken at highest quality as welllike many people have said this camera has so many features its hard to figure out how to use all of them
ive had my  for several months and i havent gotten around to trying out half the features
overall i have been pretty happy with it
while it does eat batteries most digital cameras do and its easily solved by picking up some rechargables
my only complaint is i can not get the lens cap to stay on
its not much of a problem if you always keep it in a camera case but sometimes i throw it in my purse and inevitably the lens cap will come off while im putting it in because it does not attach securely at all
a minor inconvenience mostly but still happens often enough to become frustratingthis camera has been a joy
ive seen other reviews state that getting to items in the menu can be difficult but if you spend some time reading the manual and actually using the features finding the various settings is not that bad
i keep learning new ways to use it and now carry it with me to work for those photo ops
my two mm nikons may end up gathering a lot of dust
if i had to refine my review to three items it would be good ergonomic design fits the hand well and finally fixes that bad lens cover problem exellent features burst mov manual adjustments etc
 accepts rechargable aa batteriesi waited  years for cameras to get their resolutionfeatures up and prices down
it was a toss up beteen this one and the new c love the optics but im glad i waitedthis is my third olympus digital camera
i also own the dz and dz
the c overcomes the main shortcoming of these other cameras speed
the c is speedy two critical ways
first it has an onboard memory buffer so you can shoot many shots immediately after each other
indeed it features a quotrapid shootquot and quotexposure bracketquot option to take  or  shots rapidly in about  seconds
this is a great option if you need the quotmoney shotquot
i was at a friends wedding and wanted to provide a few unique candid photos
the  did not disappoint
second is the f lens which means that low light shots are definitely possible
last month i was on the great barrier reef as turtles came up on shore to nest at night
the turtles are frightened off by light so flash photography was out
with the speed of the lens plus a near full moon and cloudless sky ive got some grainy but still incredible picturesother great features sound recordingannotation and built in usb connector soooo much faster to downloadthe c is not perfect
three issues yes the lens cap is a problem
no solution i know of
second the viewfinder is not wysiwyg
the mismatching is significant though at least the viewfinder errors on the side of showing you less than what is actually captured
third versus olympuss digital pointandshoots the cs form factor is large which sometime discourages me from carrying itso the search for the perfect digital goes on
im going to also pick up the c which solves the wysiwyg viewfinder issueafter researching the best way to scan aps film i purchased a coolscan v scanner from amazon and this ias adapter from adorama thru the amazon site
i never really found any reviews concerning scanning aps film so i stuck with the scanner that had the best reviews and bought the aps adapter to go with iti found that these units were bid up on auction sites to within fifty dollars of the price of a new unit
my plan is to scan all of my film then sell the scanner and adapterthe film scans are beautiful
much better than scans of the prints and much quicker and simpler
the software has many nice tools especially digital ice which eliminates all dust and spots with no apparent effect on the scan qualitythis is an excellent way to scan aps films which are much easier to scan than mm strips
you just put the roll in the adapter
you click one button in the nikon scan software and it displays all  or  thumbnails in a minute or two
since i had around  aps rolls to scan i set up the defaults so that it would automatically have the normal parameters set when i scanned aps films
then i just had to rotate the images to the correct orientation select all of the thumbnails and hit the scan button in the software
it asks about the file name structure and the folder they will go into and presents a few other options then it spends about an hour to scan a roll of  i go do something else during that time
i havent had any computer crashes during scanning even while browsing or running other software on my computer a lowend  sony vaio desktop simultaneouslyyou can preview all of the frames and adjust all of the scan parameters for each individual shot before the final scan
i found this to only be useful on films with mostly dark shots
it takes about  minutes to preview a roll of  it is timeconsuming to correct each shot
if there are only a few dark shots on a roll then i preview and fix the ones i am sure will need additional software cleanup
then i scan the whole roll
after scanning i reopen the files perform auto contrast on most shots make any other adjustments then resave them
very efficientthe adapter worked flawlessly for me for about  weeks scanning about  aps films mostly with  exposures but a few were exposure rolls
while scanning the last  of those films a squeaking noise developed and worsened but i ignored it because the scans did not have problems
finally the adapter choked on a exposure roll
the motor made a high pitched whining noise like some gears had stripped or something
i did manage to open the door and get the roll outthat roll had a couple creases in it but i later managed to scan it
i returned the adapter to nikon for warranty service
they returned it a couple weeks later
i completed scanning my remaining  rolls without incident
because im not sure about the expected lifetime i wouldnt advise buying a used adapteroverall my experience with the scanner and the aps adapter was good but there are a couple things they should add a reader for the aps films embedded magnetic strip
inclusion of the date as data was one of the advantages of aps film
this data could be used to adjust the file date or included as part of the filename
this would make sorting easier
a select all button for easier selection of a whole rolli gave the aps adapter only  stars due to its mechanical failure after only  rolls
nikon coolscan v is an excellent scanning system for aps film as well as mmi have had this mp player for about  weeks now and have no complaints what so ever
its cute fits well in the palm of your hand or clipped to your belt or waist band with very simple and well placed controls
right out of the box it was intuitive to use
i barely needed to glance at the instruction pamphlet included
the software for transfering files from your computer to the player was also intuitive again no help needed
the only thing i had to figure out was how to use the music match juke box with the the player and a little investigation answered this question
i have read reviews on this site that talk about a hiss at low volumes
i hadnt noticed this yet so i purposefully played a soft tract at low volume
i didnt hear anythingcertainly nothing i dont hear when i listen to mps on my computer
regarding headphones mine worked out of the box are comfortable to wear and convey great soundthis was a great purchase
im more then satisfied
the lack of expadablity is not a problem for me
 hours of music is more then enough for me for the times when i use a portable music player and then there is always the radio which has decent reception
if you are intersted in more music hours then this id recommend you look at the portable jukeboxes that are available with up to gb of memorythe only reason i dont give this player a  is because i havent tried out the other mb player by sonicbluethe rio  but honestly after reading those reviews im still more then happy to have this one and plan to get the accessory kit when it comes out
i want to play my mp in my cari received this as a gift recently
the giver did much research looking for the best features at the best price
it seems to have the most features you can get for under amt
ive enjoyed my player using it in the car by plugging it into the cassette deck and also using it at the gym while clipped onto my cardio machine
i like that we can fit about  tunes into the memory and that i can pretty much do any function with one hand
i wish the tracks could be put in a new order after being loaded in the memory though
also the headset that comes with the player did not suit me
maybe i have a narrow head but these headphones do not stay put
i am using another set of headphones instead
wrapping the band of the headphones around the back of your head looks cool but it fights gravity and ends up slipping
overall though i really like my player and plan to use it for many workouts to comeif youre buying this player because of the included fm tuner dont
every fm stations signal that i tune in with the pocket concert is weak and noisy while other radio tuners in the same location pick up a perfect strong signalfortunately i didnt buy this device for the fm tuner  i bought it because of its support of windows xp and the windows media audio format
setup was mindlessly simple i followed the clear directions installed the software connected the device and my windows xp notebook recognized it immediatelya quick trip to the intel website and i downloaded a fresher set of xp drivers and a firmware upgrade that greatly improves the function of the ffwd and rew buttons
i was blown away with the easeofuse
the upgrade also allows for direct support of windows media player
you can manage the files on the device directly from wmp without needing to use intels included managerother than the fm tuner quality the only problem i have with this player is the absence of direct dc adapter support
battery life is xaaa   hours or so
the intel accessory packs docking cradle is the only way to have audio playback without draining batteries though while connected to the pc the player is powered by the usbi had a couple of extension cords hanging up in my garage
they were coiled and were ok but it was a pain to have to get one off the wall then plug it in and uncoil it enough to use whatever tool i was plugging in
then after use the wiping it down it was resting on the garage floor after all recoiling it and rehanging it on the wall
i wanted something more user friendly
i looked at the winding cans and they looked promising but when i saw the wonder winder i thought that looked really nice and i gave it a trythe winder arrived and i opened the box
it is all plastic with the exception of the screws
dont let that scare you
this looks like pretty heavy duty plastic
i dont think it would survive me hitting it with the car while pulling into the garage but i cant imagine anything else that might happen in my garage that would destroy iti read the directions and then promptly lost them as i am prone to do
about  weeks later i decided to put it up in the garage
i was a little concerned about not having the directions but figured if i got stuck i could always find them online somewhere
well the assembly of this winder is just about idiot proof because i got it put together in no time flat
i put the cord in and started winding and it does do what it is supposed to do it winds the cord nicely and helps the organization of my garagemy only complaints are the pressure you have to put on the handle to create the friction to pull the cord
this has been addressed in other reviews and the suggestion is that you sand the main wheel slightly to give it a roughed up surface
i havent tried that yet and im not sure it is a big enough complaint that i want to do this
well see  one thing to note if you do sand it and you ruin the wheel the nice part is that you can purchase just a wheel from the green leaf company
they are currently about  if i read their website correctly
the cord sometimes will travel in the mouth of the winder and then get caught up between the wheel and the sidewall
i think this was caused because i didnt tighten the screw into the handle adequately and after tightening it has gotten better but i still seem to have it happen occasionally and i dont think i should have that problemoverall this is absolutely a good purchase it cleans up my garage and make it look better
it is similar to an air hose
you can have it wrapped up and coiled and it looks ok but it looks better on a retractable hose reeltakes some getting used to
only down fall was that you have to hold a lever up manually to wind it inmake sure you hit studs when mounting or use some heavy duty drywall inserts
other than that good productthe assembly took a few minutes more than id like and i worry that if i ever pull the cord out at an angle to the wall mount that it will snap off but it sure looks nicer than a pile of cord on the ground
i store  of very thick cord  gauge i believe but it wont really take another  of thinner cord
the problem isnt that there is a lack of room  theres a bunch of empty space in the middle
the problem is that the connection between the two cords wont feed through the hopper and even if i feed it in manually it wont coil inside the thick cord
still its the best system ive used for storing cord
i liked it enough to buy a second one as a giftthis is a fairly good product
its works wellthe only complaint i have is that it feels like im going to break it everytime i use it
the plastic needs to be sturdieri recommend this product for light usethis works as advertised i have had one for years and it has worked perfectly fine though it has managed to twist the power cord  a bit near the end
i wont handle heavy gage cords howevermounts easy and works pretty good  it needs a little help once in awhile  makes it easy to store and fast to use  i recommend that you tie the female end in a knot to keep it from slipping insidei just installed one of these and it does work as advertised
the cord winds neatly into a net and it works with  cords connected together but that requires manual intervention
however winding this requires  hands  to hold the cord and yoke what they call it against the larger wheel and another to crank the larger wheelalso it cannot turn and be flat with the wall it always protrudes from the wall
still at least i got my cords off the floorthis is a pretty good product
its a little cheaply made but then its pretty cheaply priced too and the design is pretty clever
mine works fine and i use it with some heavy duty cords
maybe those who couldnt wind it should read the directions
if you dont push the lever it doesnt wind but when you use it according to the instructions it works greatim very pleased with this
i use a few electricpowered garden tools such as a blowervac and a hedge trimmer and keeping the cord organized has always been a chore
this little gadget makes cord storage and use a lot easiervery easy to use
the only issue i had with installation is that the mounting bracket has an arrow that points up
however if you mount it with the arrow up the unit ends up being tilted
before screwing in the bracket hold it up to where you want to mount it with the unit attached
that will show you the correct mounting position
dont trust the arrowim having no problems using it with  gauge  foot line
i tried it with  gauge and it worked ok but there was a bit of a struggle to get the line wound up properly
my  gauge is only  feet but id guess  foot would fit
dont even try it with  gauge
its not sturdy enough to handle that and survive for long
a better bet for  gauge is the more expensive buckettype holder such asquick winder rap electric cord and fiber optic cable reelthe cage that holds the cord is made of string
that will probably be the first point of failure
to help extend its life i remove the holder from the bracket when done so that the weight of the cord is not constantly stretching the cagenot the most sturdy holder ive seen but easy to use and well worth the price especially if you catch it as a gold box deal or on a price dipi have had this product for about two years and it has done a good job
the only issue i have found is that if you use two shorter cords it will be unable to swallow the plugs and you have to feed that portion through by hand
in my experience it winds the cord neatly  of the time
ive not seen any issue with wear of the cord or the winderworks as decribed
setting up requires attention to detail for botton of mesh bag
suggest a light lubricant on mount before attaching reel unit to circular wall base
extends and recoils cords quickly and easily
worth the moneythe rewinder is exactly what i wanted
it is made of hard plastic light yet durablethank youjimworks as advertised
handles my  of  without a problem
love the two brackets
put one one in the garage and the other on the deck
only gave it four stars until i see how it lasts and wears
overall a good productdont let the low price disuade you
this little unit is very sturdy  performs exactly as described
easy to assemple and installa good buy july  you find this kind of device in catalogs that are full of gadgets that appear to cleverly solve some niche problem but if you ever buy them you find that they dont really improve your lifethis isnt one of them
it works pretty much and its a heck of a lot easier than a more conventional cord winder
a couple of times i have had problems winding a cord that was wet and so slippery but other than that it winds the cord up pretty fast and rather to my surprise the cord has always fed out without tanglingmounting is a little tricky because you want to get the device upright but it twists as you attach the device to the mounting bracket so its hard to find the exact right orientation for the mounting bracketoccasionally when its fully extended the cord gets detached from the bottom of the bag or gets aligned straight through the hole and so it needs a bit of help to get started windingi want another one so that i can keep one in the garage and one on the back porch
 november  still the best winder ive found
 march  still happy
 november  broke the handle had to buy another one
still happyworks okay but not allot of pull on the cord
if there is anything blocking the cord from going in you can crank and crank with the cord going no where
bought this for work because i was tired of everyone wadding up the vacuum cord i thought this would help make the cord easy to put away so maybe someone would put it away
for the most part its great to wind up the cord but other people still just toss the cord in the corner and tie it in knots not the winders fault
i would recommend this to others based on teh fact it does work quite well just dont expect it to drag the extension cord back in without a bit of helpreally theres no comparing this cord winder with other handheld cord winders
the wonder winder works as advertised and makes household chores less of a hassle such as using corded power and yard toolsthe wonder winder is made from a heavyduty plastic combined with a mesh basket think of a basket ball net
it mounts to the wall using a plastic brace
handle is adjustable for lefties or righties
it also comes with an extra wall mount so you can relocate the wonder winder with minimal hasslepulling the cord out is smooth and trouble free
no more kinks or twists
winding the cord is easy too but can be a tad irritating if your cord is very slickyou may have to try a couple different extension cords for the absolute best performance
some extension cords seem to be a tad too slick and will slip every now and then or require a lot of pressure on the clutchthe swivel mount is an option that you must purchase from the manufacturer directly
i havent found any need for it yet but i can see how the winder would be more useful with itworks as designed was bought for my dad he thinks its better than sliced bread i glad hes happy with iti got this to replace the  cord holder i had
this works much better since i dont have to get filthy when i wind the cord back up
some assembly required
pretty easy to get mounted and i have used it enough time to say that its worth the price
although i though for being almost entirely plastic it would have been a bit cheaperwell i have to say this thing rocksst impressions a small box arrived i thought it would be bigger for some reason i mounted it to the wall directly to an exposed studpair in the garage
for some reason it came with two mounts
i may mount the other on the shed in the backyard heck i should just buy another unit
it did not come with the swivel pictured but the instructions do say optional
i may get one at the big box store for 
that will make this thing even better for  this thing does a good job wrapping up the ft cord i bought with iti am impressed
it looked cheap in the box but it does the job just smoothlyi will check back in after the summer to let you know how it held upthe way that this works is you use one hand to pull on a lever to add some friction while the other hand cranks the wheel
im going try adding a tension spring to the lever to see if i cant make this a  handed tool
it would be nice to be able to use the other hand for guiding the incoming extension cord since its usually coming from every different corner of my garage
usually i just straddle the extension cord and guide it with my foot but then my pants get all dirtypulling the cord out of the basket is super easy and i havent had a single tangleperfect gadget for your garage i use it all the time garage tools vacuum cleaner blower pressure washer is greatthe only thing i dont like is the color but thats just menow im buying another one
when did the ubiquitous made in china sticker appear on these
i guess theyd have to charge more if they used good old american plasticif the product would have included the swivel bracket i would have given it five stars
this is a great product but the swivel bracket wasnt included with the item which is shown in the product picture
the swivel bracket is sold separatelyill admit i was skeptical of this thing but it was a gold box deal so i thought i would give it a whirl
and boy am i glad i didthe wonder winder was super easy to put together
in no time i had it assembled and ready to testi brought our  ft heavy duty extension cord in from the cold garage and let it warm up
ill also have to admit that i thought there was no way that long cord sprawled out all over the floor was going to fit in the wonder windersince i didnt yet have the wonder winder mounted to a wall i had my wife help hold it
you apply a bit of pressure on the top handle which pinches the cord between two wheels and allows you to real it in
in just a couple minutes we had the cord wound up and it actually did fit
we were pleasantly surprisedi took it out to the garage and mounted the included wall bracket hung it up plugged it in and its ready to goi would have given  stars but theres a couple minor annoyances the baskets cinchup cord is sort of a pain to tie off
if left open the cord would just fall out through the bottom and theres no instruction to let you know this
the mounting bracket has  holes   vertically spaced and  horizontally spaced
i didnt want to use only the verticals only since i felt if the unit got bumped from the side it was easily break the plastic bracket
the horizontal holes are too far apart to screw into a x stud
luckily i had a span of two studs that were sidebyside
nothing major but keeps it from being perfect for mei originally bought a ww about  years ago and it handled a  foot  cord with regular use since then
if a cord is wet or has snow on it the wheel will slip but with a little bit of work it will go
i recently upgraded to a low temperature  cordus wire   foot sjeow tpe cold weather extension cord blue with lighted plugand tried to load it into the ww  the wheel just slipped on the cord
when i tried harder the arm for the idler pulley broke note there was some old damage so i didnt blame the ww entirely
after looking at the alternatives i decided to order another wwi had to make  modifications to the ww for it to handle that cord
first i wrapped blue painters tape around the drive wheel to give it more traction on the slippery low temperature cord
second i joined the basket from the first ww with the basket from the new ww to handle the extra volume of cord
with those changes it seems to worki cannot find any alternative to hold a  foot extension cord so that you can pull it off the reel while its in use
for a standard   foot extension cord i used this with no modifications
im taking one star off for it not being able to handle a low temperature  cord without mods
that said im happy to own this and especially for the price recommend it highlynote agreeing with other reviews this does not come with the swivel mount but instead  plastic mounts that do not swivel
conveniently i was able to reuse the swivel mount from my old wwi use a  heavy duty extension gord quite regularly and this has really been a lifesaver in keeping the cord under control
it looks flimsy but gets the job done really wellthis does what it claims itll do  and works well for ga and ga extension cords
it didnt seem to want to wind my ga cord reliably for which i took a star but at this price point i can live with that since i dont need to use the heavy gauge cord ofteni ordered one just to see how it went  and after a few weeks of steady use have enjoyed the simplicity of this enough that a second one is on the way as i type thisbought this and installed it last fall
havent really used it much but it was easy to install and put the cord in
seems to be okay time will tell on durability and ease of pulling a cord out and reeling it in
will update this spring after using it morei like this as it is simple and it works
keeps my extension cord all cleaned up and more importantly it makes cleaning it up snapthe riovolt sp for its price is a very good buy
while the iriverslim and sp are better they also have the price to matchbeing able to unpgrade the firmware makes this product outstanding
technology will advance and sooner than we know a new format is going to be out with a upgradable firmware the rio is a great buy for that sole reasonwhile most people can store  songs i uually stay around  i use mostly  kbit songs and a few  kbits never anything lower
while this does eat up more memory the sound quality is signifigently better
however it has been found once you go over  songs the rio has problems recognizing themwhile most users complain that it is hard to scroll through  songs change the scroll speed ff speed etc they all dont understand how to use the rio to its full potential
burn music in folders on to cdrws and they will appear as directories
beware though directcd often creatures strange folders that were not burned such as popnation or rockathon that contain no music
with ungrade  many new options are avaible
you can change almost anything
ff speed scroll speed even a custom eq settings
experiment thats the only way to reach the full potential dont tell the durability though
if you turn a rio off then turn it back on without removing the cd will resume where you stopped
if you turn the player off in the middle of garbage  when i grow up the rio will contiune from the middle well at least for my player
for playlist the instructions are not complicated and can done without much troublethe rio rarely skips that remember that depends on what setting the rio has been set and the charge to the batteries
a rio with low charge batteries will skip far easier
ive sprinted with the rio in my hand with full charge battieries and the rio did not skip for a full minutethe sound quality is good but that depends on the quality of the songs you burn
burning  kbits songs will give you bad quality sound
the earbuds the rio comes with are good
they dont get staticy as the sound level rises
alot of headphones dothe large backlit display is far better than many cd players the decent battery life and durablity are all good qualities
ive dropped my rio in its leathercase two feet on to concrete by accident and my rio was fine
the leather case really helps stop scrathesthe customer service contrary to belief is good
my rio stopped work for some reason and with a few emails i sent my rio to sonicblues hq paid for shipping  amd had a new one sent to me within two weeks
the new one works better than me old one
however if you have problems and must use customer service through emails dont delete anything from the previous email when u reply
thats probably the reason why other users think rios customer service stinksthe single problem i have with the rio is the remote
three of my friends bought riovolts sps and within two months the remotes all stopped working except for a single button
while this isnt a big deal the remote that came with my sp is weak flismy and not dependable
if sonicblue hasnt started including the new remotes i seriously suggest you buy a new remote if you get a sp
the remote looks like the sps but not blacksonicblue has continously evaulated the sp since the first day they started shipping
originally the opening of the leather case was on the right side holding opening away from you and making it akward to pull the cd player out
then whenever a new upgrade went up on the support site all new shipping rios were upgraded
this is a good buy for its price
however id suggest you look into the sp or the iriver slimwhile being a little cheaply built this is the best mpcd player currently on the market
firmware upgrades have done a lot to solve some of the glitches that are discussed in other reviews  there is a resume where you left off function no more gaps between songs along with all kinds of other features
it skips for me when i put it on my belt on the treadmill but not if i hold it in my hand
no problems with it in my bag
not the greatest battery life so far but it plays my cdrs and cdrws like a champ
all in all excellent product especially if you upgrade the headphonesi was looking for an mpcd that i could use for working out jogging etc
over a period of two months i tried out a compaq ipaq riovolt philips expanium and rio   the ipaq and rio  obviously didnt have any skipping problems but they also didnt have the storage capacity that a cdrw player gives youin the end both the riovolt and the expanium had problems with skipping
although both claim to have skip protection between    seconds i found that neither could actually sustain skip free performance while jogging
most frustrating is that when it does skip you need to stop what youre doing so it can catch up and cache the next couple seconds of data
needless to say this is completely frustrating and disruptive to a workout
i tried two different units for each model in case i had a defective unit
the problem still persistedall of that is to say that if you are active and looking for a player stick with one of the flash card ones or wait until newer mpcd players come out with better skip protectionwith that said the volt is a great player
firmware upgrades can be installed easily to allow the player to read new music formats
the remote that attaches to the headphones is very useful particularly if you keep your player in a backback briefcase or waist belt
the system has excellent sound and navigation controlson the down side the case that comes with the unit is hardly functional particularly in that it doesnt provide a front window to see the display
you will benefit by buying a better pair of headphones given that the quotear budquot headphones are barely adequate
the little characters at the bottom of the screen are really not necessary  it reminded me of an old burger time game
i cant figure out while rio would take such a nice looking unit and cheapen the look by adding themoverall the unit is great if youre not going to use it while being active
look for rio to be a definite player in this market with newer versions in the futureeverything about the riovolt is well thought out
the unit is about as small as it could possibly be the rubber pads on the bottom keep it from sliding either at home or at the gym the controls are easy to navigate and the  button which lets you skip forward  tracks is a great idea
the remote control is just the right lengthi can keep the unit in my backpack when walking yet still control all of the functionsif you buy this unit the first thing youll want to do is upgrade the firmware
this gives the ability to add custom eq and more importantly skip forward or back  tracks using the remoteso why only four stars
the unit doesnt support mps recorded at a  hz sample rate
i had to rerecord pretty much my entire collection before i could use the uniti got this fascinating gadget for my birthday a few days ago and ive found it to be almost the perfect tool for any serious mp music collector that wants access to hisher music on the roadthe positive as most people know from other reviews this player plays both quotnormalquot music cds as well as cds with mps in them
the cool thing i found about this is that i didnt need to do any tweaking to the way i had my mps coded or named
i used musicmatch jukebox as my ripping software and whichever default values it came with fitted perfectly the rio volt meaning that the palyer recognized the tracks as well as the name of the songs which is displays in its lcd screen want shock proof
tested it in my car and while riding my bike
when i played normal cds the performance i have to admit was just ok nothing out of the ordinary
but when i played mps due to the way it operates it was flawless
there was one big exception to this which i have to note if the mp song youre playing happens to have any sort of sound artifacts see negative  for details youre not going to enjoy the playback as much anyway the way it works is it takes music in chunks of  minutes or so and reads it off the cd
then it sends it to its memory so what youre listening to actually comes from the memory not from the cd directly which makes it pretty much shockproof
this concept has been in use several years to provide that buffer or whatever its called of several seconds that traditional cdplayers have when the lens skips the cd due to a bump for example giving the cd enough time to recover by continuing to play from memory
the difference is that here this memory amounts to several some  minutes of music so the cd stops spinning a few seconds after you press play which is also very good in terms of battery usage the navigation scheme it offers to find songs takes almost no time to learn and offers enough information in the lcd screen for the user to be able to move around the cd with ease
 not too expensive
just a little more than plain mponly players the ones that that read cds and considerably less expensive than others such as the nomad jukebox which dies at gb what is that
 cds
with this one youre limited to your collection of mp cds
not bad ah
the negativethe rio volt in fact has very few flaws namely from worst to most tolerable when you are listening to mps and you press the stop button not only does it stop
when you press play again it goes back to the very beginning of the cd
this can be very bad if you happened to be listening to one of the very last tunes in your cd
this i have to say is not nice if you happen to have noisyquot or should i say jumpy mps you know what i mean you will run into disturbing moments with the rio volt
you need to make sure your mps are clean which at times can be a little challenging depending on your sourcing for them
what will happen is that while reading the mps to store them in memory it will think that the noise in the mp was caused perhaps by a bump on the road and will retry to read it for as long as you can imagine literally killing the song from that point on
however if you have a clean mp collection not an easy thing to have in fact this will be a minor thing to bear with the case that comes with the player
rio people you guys ran out of ideas
its just awful
and worst it doesnt have any windows so you can accidentally i did hit the play button and have the player working while you dont even suspect it is which combined with disadvantage  can prove very annoying and batterysucking the ear buds which as i had read before are very uncomfortable
these of course are easily replaceablehonestly if it were not for the  and  negatives id give it a five
the other two negatives i can easily live withim very happy with my mp player i need all the computer resources for the programs i work with so i rather hear my mps on an external device
the riovolt was just the solution i was looking fori just took my riovolt to europe for  days and avoided having to take my entire cd collection
instead of almost  cds and s of mps i was able to fit it all on  mp cdrs  and with only one device i still had room to take my favorite cds too
my only complaints are that battery life is a little shorter than advertised and the interface is a little clumsy at times
however the rios flash memory can be updated by downloading from the website so new features may be in the works  even long after you have bought it you can add the new features
overall i am pleased with the quality of construction much better than id expect from the  mpcd competitors
but as with any portable cd be careful with itwant to put close to  cuts on a disk
want hours and hours of music available to you on each cd you burn
want to pay a reasonable price for great performance
kids the rio volt is the goods
this unit performed flawlessly out of the box on a pair of aa batteries
they packed duracells with the unit how cool is it that they didnt send a pair of quotjoes pretty good batteriesquot instead
after a day of nearconstant use those same batteries are still delivering great performance which is amazingalso amazing is this units resistance to skipping
i tucked it into the carrying case and shoved the whole thing into my coat pocket so that it bounced along against my hip all afternoon and not once did this puppy skip on me
now im not a jogger so i cant tell you if its going to run the marathon with the same flawless performance but i can say that itll take normal bouncing around in its stridethe design is clean and very straightforward
play pause stop forward back vol
up and down are all obvious theres no guesswork involved
just glance at the unit and youll know what button to push
a little less obvious but not difficult to figure out are prog
program a sequence of songs
i havent used this yet
 skips ahead  cuts mode a full array of repeat commands and a couple of nice shuffle features and eq equalizer  your choice of normal rock jazz classical or honking huge bass
cant say its really impressive but its not bad
the only control thats a little tricky is navi
this takes you through your directories allowing you to see the title of each song
it might take you a minute or two to figure out how to navigate but its not rocket sciencethe unit includes an eight function remote with a clip so you can attach it to your body
the design while aesthetically pleasing is a little awkward
the clip doesnt hold on very well a light tug will pull it off whatever its clipped to
and when you go to reattach it youre likely to turn the unit off or skip backwards or forwards
it does allow you to raise and lower the volume set the hold switch locking the controlsor switch settings on the equalizer without having to pull the unit out of your pocket or bag or off your belt
thats nice but i think something you could grip safely might have worked a bit better
the remotes design is the reason why this unit gets only  stars instead of the display window is a large backlit lcd
on startup it displays the total number of cuts on the cd
press play and youll get song information file format file number and elapsed time
in addition it shows the mode the program and tells you if youre on hold
it looks as if it has a low battery warning but i havent seen that yetthe bundled software includes applications for creating your own cds but theres nothing on any of them that you must use in order to enjoy the volt
according to the package the unit supports not only audio cds and mps but quotpopular music formatsquot including wma files and is upgradable so that the unit will be compatible with emerging standards
if all this is true the volt really is a longterm investment
and with a price tag of less than well do i have to tell you what a bargain this isbottom line it makes it possible for you to have all the music you could ever want in an affordable flexible compact packagewhat others say about the riovolt being the best right now rings true
its a good product reasonably priced with better features than pricier models like the expanium
the display keeps that fifth star in my pocket though
its easily large enough to hold six or seven lines of text but someone apparently thought it would be cool to waste more than onethird of the display on static useless graphics that repatedly animate and use up power
it is a neat little thing  for about four seconds
still as much as that one feature  most everything else is goodthe first mp cd players were picky about what discs they would play and lacked any features beyond  barebones playback
but these products have matured quickly and after seeing sonicblues rio volt were  ready to say that mp cd players have arrived
aside from an awkward carrying case we were hardpressed to  find anything wrong with this player
best of breed to put this device through its paces we burned a number of  test cds which included mps and wma files with a wide range of bit rates
we used cdrs cdrws discs  with everything in one root directory discs with songs organized in folders and a number of different burning  preferences within the included easy cd creator standard  for pc and soundjam for macintosh software  packages
much to our surprise the rio volt handled every disc that we threw at it with aplomb
its also only  the second mp cd player weve seen that reads id tags the pine technology dmusic smc being the  first
without id tags you have to plod through  songs on each cd using only track numbers as a guide so  we consider them a necessity
its also the only such player to play wma files as well as mps and audio cds
but there were many other reasons to be impressed by this newcomer
the  button which lets you jump  ahead ten songs makes navigating more than a hundred songs much easier
you can also group your songs in  folders since the volt lets you navigate within directories unlike the other players that weve seen
a shuffle  mode lets you skip around between all the songs on the cdr while the ab mode is useful for looping any  section of audio
we were as impressed by the players form as we were by its function the understated  rounded design is starkly modern compared to those of other portable mp cd players which often look like  prototypes
skip the skipping the volt collects  seconds of audio from mpwma discs and stores the sound  for playback in a flashmemory buffer
when playing back standard audio cds you can choose between  and   seconds of antiskip protection  seconds consumes more power
while walking around with the device in  a bag we encountered an occasional delay when fastforwarding between songs on an mpwma cd
however once the music started playing skipping was not a problem
if we can single out one problem with the  volt it would have to be the carrying case which must be threaded through your belt if you want to attach it to  your hip
the player itself doesnt have a belt clip
while the player is in the case you cant tell which song is  playing or whether the player is on or off since theres no display on the remote control
but at  the rio volt  has to be one of the best portable audio values around
unless you really need a very small light mp player for  exercise or travel multiformat cd players such as this one are the way to go since theyre cheaper and hold  many more songs on a single cd
some other players cost a little less than the rio but its ability to play every  type of mpwma cdr and cdrw that we burned definitely makes it your best betnice review huh
i thought it was alrighti might have praised it too much but you can decide for yourselfoverall i think this is a very good product
i cannot give it  becuase there are a few things that bug me battery life is short it does not hold the mode you are in so if you are in random and turn it off it does not start in that mode agian a feature that is hard to find anyway so the case it comes with is useless antishock is soso
i use it at the gym and it works great for everything but jogging
i got a gym belt for it and on sec anti skip normal audio cds dont do very well
mps do ok i have to take the belt off and hang it off the tredmill then it is fineover all though i am pleased i bought itthese cdrs feature a black writing surface
it makes it look like psx disks
they work fine as good as any bluegreen surface cdrsrecommendedok as a proud owner of a dcrpc i was amazed to see that pc had all the improements that i wished for on the pc model
the buttons are well placed the hand holding with the flip out lever extension is a plus and the pop up flash is a nice touch
but it still only has a  mega pixel still camera capability which is not good enough for most camera buffs
the video and sound quality are still excellent auto focus appears to be the same good but not perfectas with the pc if you have either a imac or mac with firewire or a sony pc you can edit the digital video without to many problems
likewise the sony usb card reader is a must
the serial reader will not work with a mac and is so slow to download on a pc
also get the  mb card over the  mb card for some reason the  mb card seems to get slower as it fill upif you get this camcorder you must realize that the conventional vhs tape copies will lose some of the high quality video image and some of the sound quality as well
svhs seems to do a better job but few pwople have svhs units so sharing could be a problemthe best solution would be one of those nice dvd recorders that are just starting to appear onthe market
digital to digital media what could be betteri recently decided to get this camera and sell off my trv because i really found i needed something smaller to carry around
it was a tough choice as the image quality and stills from the trv were decidedly better
but i just couldnt pass up the size
this one is so small for the features you get
it has many many well thought out features
for instance it has a little swingdown handle to make filming easier always an issue with these little digicams
you can hook the camera directly to your computer through usb no need to get a card reader
popup flash is nice for doing indoor shots
easy to use menus
fairly high resolution stills for a digital camcorder
i love the sony batteries that tell you how much time you have leftsame for the tapes and memory cards
plenty of features that a camera at this level should havenow for the negatives
no progressive scan
let me say that again
no progressive scan
heaven knows why sony continues to leave this feature off
it was so noticeable between this camera and the trv which does have progressive scan when you capture stills off of video
the ones from this camera are nowhere near as good
not even close
if the subject is moving at all which is usually the whole point of trying to capture a still from video without progressive scan it is just not as clear sharp colorful etc
why sony does not put progressive scan on their cameras is beyond me
most of the other gripes i have with this camera are fairly minimal
some of the buttons are fairly hard to locate the zoom is hard to use and rather touchy the photo button is right next to it so i often hit the wrong one etc
fairly typical problems for a camera of this size
were it not for progressive scan being missing though this would definitely be a star camcorder
without it sorry sony
you blew it againthe pc appears to be a slight reworking of the pc with the aim of making it a better still camera and integrating it more closely with sonys other video imaging products
it takes true megapixel stills and also will store very short mpeg videos on its memory stick card
viewing these requires a pcunfortunately the way this is implemented makes this device more like two cameras than one
you are either in quotmemoryquot mode or quotcameraquot mode when recording quotmemoryquot mode or quotvcrquot mode when playing back
stills and mpeg are transferred through the usb port dv video through the firewire
it all makes sense when you realize that this camera does not consider mpeg to be a tape format
but it does take some time to get used to
and after you get used to it you can move on to tricky little things like transferring small portions of your dv video onto the memory stick as mpeg etc
i think you can even transfer stills from memory stick to tape if youd ever want to do thatthe message here is this is the camera for people who want to do something with their images other than just watch them as is
it has a lot of features for incamera editing and effects though as has been pointed out in the editorial review you can do this more easily on a pc than in the camerafinally ignore the comments about the ergonomics
the author was holding the camera the wrong way
your pinky should be nowhere near the focus or still photo controls
a closer reading of the manual and some experimentation would have put him straightive used the product a few times
so far it has worked well
rated it a  because longevity is an issue id consider in a rating and i havent had it long enough yetbut amazon emailed me twice sono complaintthis is a very nice headset for skype
i use it on linux without a problemthe only cons are dealing with the really long cord and the sometimes uncomfortable hard plastic headpiecethe headset was exactly what i expected after reading previous reviews
the material is very thin and light  not something i would want to travel with
i have a large head and the fit is very comfortable  very light on the ears
the sound is good although i dont listen to quality music with them
the mike is twoway adjustable
overall im very satisfiedheadset works fine
i like the folding design to make it easier to carry in my laptop bag but unfortunately the dsp brick in the middle of the line adds significantly to the bulk and there are a lot of wires to cram into my bag  untangle when i pull it outthis headset offers good comfort especially for the price
i use this headset almost entirely for voip ie
skype and have had great success with the audio quality both on the headphone prtion and microphone portion
the fact that it is a usb headset is wonderful because i can select it as my audio device for skype but i can still have my computer speakers playing music even while im on the phone
that would not be possible with a standard nonusb headset
installation was also a breeze everything was automatic for me in windows xp pro spmy bigest complaint is the exteremly long cable and large box that hangs off of it
this is an issue for me because i use a laptop and this headset travels with me all over town everyday
unfortunately all usb headsets have some time of box hanging off of them
the benefits of a usb headset for me outweight his problem and im happy to lug it around but still wish it wasnt requiredi have used this headset for playback of music and while the quality isnt great i dont believe that is this headset primary purpose and for the price i think it performs acceptably
overall i would recomend this headset especially for voip like usesthe item received is everything the that i ordered and wanted
i use it every day and i am happy with my purchas
i would purchase from this dealer again
the shipping days were only  and i had my product
great customer servicei bought this headset after my work bought me the fancy wireless plantronics for use with dragon naturally speaking  i have found that the accuracy of the program picked up dramatically and the audio sound quality is excellent
my only quip and this is a small one is that the wires get tangled often but that could be the users faultthese headphones do what they are supposed to do
i use them just for using skype and they do a good job
as others have written they do start to get uncomfortable after a while  say an hour or so
however thats true of most cheaper headphones in my experiencegood headset
folds into a reasonable size and adjusts well to fit head
sound quality in the headphones is good and the microphone has good reception
i use this with a laptop for online voip conference calls
it works very well and no one on the calls has mentioned any issues with the quality of the soundi use these with a windows xp setup and had some trouble getting them to work properly with the plug and play setup
i downloaded drivers from plantronics and have had no issues since
i only plug them in when i am going on a conference call the usb port picks them up without issue and they work finethe cord and block are big  get in the way my only gripea great purchase
i saved a lot of money and got my purchase quicklythe plantronics dsp is a good quality usb headset
on macs there are no drivers to install they work great right out of the box
the sound quality is excellent and they are terrific for internet telephony via skype see for software
the headset collapses and folds in half to make carrying in a computer bag easier however this set of hinges also makes it feel flimsy
ive been using it successfully for over a month with no problems
if i was buying today id opt for the slightly more expensive dsp as they seem a bit sturdier than the  model as they dont fold and seem to have a more ridgid construction
aside from that feature this headset is a good bargain and the sound quality for telephony or just listening to music is terrific
the earphones rest comfortabley on top of the ear and allow for ambient room sound to enter which is good in an office environment so you can hear your coworkers when they come into your officei travel a fair amount overseas on business and i use skype to call back to the us home mostly but also other places
i go through computer headsets like kleenex
between the airlines breaking them in my luggage and the tsa folks mangling them ive probably trashed  or  in the past year
i tend to buy cheapies if theyre going to get wrecked anyway
the quality is usually awful
this unit has been a pleasant surprisethis unit is bulky
it doesnt fold down that small and it has a largish brick inline
it does work very well though and it seems to pick up and send out less noise than ive experienced in the past with skypeive picked up a padded tool pouch for it and it stores pretty neatly in there
it has a long cord which can be a snarl but also lets one wander over to make coffee while on the phone in a hotel roomall in all im very happy with this unit
it isnt small thoughfirst the good news
this is a very high quality headset for desktops
voice quality is excellent
ive used it for skype dragon and for voice overs on instructional videos
the microphone is clear the noise canceling works well and it outputs good volume
i dont know if it has the range for singing but for spoken word its great
the inline mute switch is a nice extrathe headphones are also of good quality easily the match of any headset in the price range even those that lack mics
they are comfortable for extended wearing and seem reasonably durablethe bad news comes if you want to travel with the headset
it is bulky somewhat heavy for a folding set and the box on the end of the cord is rather large though not as heavy as it looksi wonder what the designers were thinking
the ability to fold would lead me to think that this was designed for portability but the bulkiness and weight are a bit high but not terrible for that purposestill im very happy with the headset and can live with the bulk for the few times i need to take it out of the officei use this with my macbook pro
skype etc
works great
excellent office type performancethe material of the folding headphones appear a bit chinsy
i live in fear of breaking themthe dsp module is bulkythere is a half mile of cable with this thing
it is great if you are planning to walk around in the office with the headphones on  butnet result  this thing is not for being taken on the road
if you need a decent pair of office headphonemic set  at a great price go for iti bought this one to replace an older headsetmic for my skype purpose via the internet to phone communication
so far so good
i dont find the box to be too bulky as some reviewers have said but it definitely is therebought this to use with skype and it works as advertised
the cable is very long  ft but has a block much smaller than a transformer brick near the usb connection
havent been able to keep it connected all the time  because system sounds will then go through it id rather listen to the speakers
there might be something in the setup that i dont have configured right
also the hinge points are almost too easy to move
they collapse very easily when not onbought this headset for use with mac os  and skypepros works perfectly with skypegreat sound quality both in and out
hardware controls volume mute work perfectly with mac
no software necessary for mac
neat folding design
comfortable even for long conversations
great value paid less on amazon then they typically go on ebaycons relatively minor for me even after folding kinda bulky if you will be traveling with them a lotwish the wires werent so longtoo long for the average userperhaps making them prone to damage
plantronics used to include a nice case but no case included anymore at least as sold on amazon one minor glitch 
with mac is that the headphones revert to mute whenever first plugged in or computer is restartedall in all the best wired headset available for the mac and skypealthough i havent tried any other headsets the quality on this one is very good
i use the headset for skype
easy to use no set up just plug it in a usb port
sounds seems very good even when listening to musici have been using these headphones for  years and i am just now replacing them
i used them for gaming voip listening to mps and believe it or not some voice recording
they have been great
theyve been tossed around the room a few times and still appear like new
the first complain i have is about the spongy microphone cover falling off it always did fall off and was annoying to keep putting back on
also its dying now one ear doesnt work and the other is slowly fading and cutting in and out
so it lasted a very solid  years
it has a very high quality microphone but the audio isnt the best it gets distorted on higher volumes but then again my set is old and i dont quite remember what it was like new
overall its a fantastic set of headphones and im buying a new set of plantronic headphones dsp s to replace this one it deserves a proper burial i found this headset to be plug and play with my powermac g
works well with skype
sound great for voice but very weak bass for music
they are a bit heavy after some time but are comfortably paddedhad this one for over a year for online gaming dictating to a word document listening to music etc  overall im satisfied althought for the money i think they could have done a much better job in every aspect
i only payed  online while it was  at the store
had best reviews at the time and indeed it sounds almost as good as my  sony studio phones when i play my stereo
drivers are stable and it sounds very gooddigital remote volume control is very handy
youll love itbad things since its basically a usb sound card i have to keep flipping between dsp for games and my audigy if i want to listen to music in the house  maybe its winxp fault i was able to use  sound cards at wonce under winpro
this gotten very annoying
platronics tech support said thats the way it is
although construction is very solid and the ear muffs are comphy its an ugly looking headset and is not snugg on my head
if i shake my head fast itll fly off i wish theyd make the ear pieces much bigger for more noise canceling hugging the whole ear and used mm magnets for greater base reproduction
why is it always one or the other
why cant americans learn to make practial things that also look good
 i realized nobody sees me playing games at night so if i hang it under the desk it doesnt bother me much
if you dont care about the looks this is the best headset you can buy for gamingive had mine for months and have played countless hours of battlefield  and used them with teamspeak
they sound terrific fit will and all around were a nice purchaseim giving them  stars because i would have preferred an optiondesign that allowed me to move the mic to the other side of my head
not a huge deal but what i was used to wasnt the left sidesolid purchaseim overly critical of sound quality
at home i have the tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection
this doesnt compare to that but the tritton is  toofor the  this is really nice
sound microphone and wire quality are all good
controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too
theyre also fairly comfortable
good headset for workthese headphones worked great with my sound system
it could use a little more volume but the bass boost on this is nice
i use this constantly for musical recordings with my friends  blending the recording with the instrumental makes the newly formed track almost  clearthese headphones were easy to install and have worked flawlessly so far
the sound quality is very good
the comfort level of the headphones is decent but not outstandingthis is a great box
it played every mp disk i threw at it without skipping including disks written in macintosh vbr format
the sound is very good and the remote is very useful btw you can access the shuffle mode from the unit itself
the only real negatives are lack of id support though navigation by numbers is not that hard especially if you have a printout of whats on the disk and the fact that there is no headphone jack
this means you cannot hook the unit up to your home stereo either
not a big deal if you already have an mpplaying dvd player however
all in all a nicelydesigned portable
currently the best on the marketthis unit while missing a few desireable features makes up for them in other wayswhat i like designappearancesize cute little remote control backlit display comprehensive mp file format handling note not wma or others fit and finish controls layout excellent sound fully digital tuning and volume controls all accessible from the remote price twocolor display green for tunercd orange for mpcdswhat i dislike nothing important
i knew that it lacked id track label display though it does differentiate different albums within a cd so thats not really a disappointment though obviously it would be nice
hopefully you know what you laboriously spent time collecting and burning anyhow i feel
i wouldnt have minded a clockalarmtimer function though a slight disappointment here
not sure how well i like the onboard jog dial which controls ffrevplaypausestop etc plus it may be the only part that seems as though it may exhibit potential fragility though that remains to be seen
it may be fine
in any case the controls are all replicated on the remote and then somei had considered the rca mpcd player but it lacked a backlight though it did display ids
i personally feel that a backlight is far more important  a stupid feature to not include
i prefer the philips brandname anyhow and it cant touch this unit for looks and style
this unit is built well and looks great like the sony cfde but the sony lacks mpcd support and a backlight
i didnt care about a cassette player  usually the weakest link in a portable systemto summarize i highly recommend this product
you wont be disappointed so long as you acknowledge its few shortcomings and arent unpleasantly surprised
its a winner for sure
i think it will sell  and serve  very wellthis is my third cd based mp player
the first two audiovox and napa would skip or freeze with lower bitrate mps such as commonly found with audiobooks
i have over  books on cd and have tested them all
it choked on two of them
sure it has the drawbacks as previously mentioned
i particularly miss a headphone jack and a volt dc adapter
but hey its the best thing going right now and perhaps philips will address these issues in future models
it is fairly heavy and has the feel of quality to it except for the goofy shuttle dial
the remote functions properly and has a good feature set
i heartily recommend this player especially if you prefer listening to audiobooksworks pretty well with my kd
its ir so it requires line of sight and it doesnt have a terrifically remarkable range
but it works as advertised and i didnt want to waste my time spending  bucks and waiting a month to get a cheap knock off from china that may or may not workanother thought
its tiny
look at the cheap flash drive you have lying on your desk its a half inch smaller than thatits very tiny
its great if youre close enough but i found myself actually needing it at more than its  foot limit so it just sits in my camera most of the timeif possible i would rate this item  starsive been using the pentax remote control f with a kd camera body and bg battery pack and have high praise for the small device
for me the wireless remote performs the task of operating a kd camera and after  months of uses without any hiccups and has never let me down
the unit is very compact and the engineers at pentax found a way to store the device inside the bg battery pack
a smart design feature that i appreciate very much as i know i will never be without the wireless remotea side note when pointing the near ir led on the remote with in the field of view of the lens you are using the near ir led at the pointing end of the wireless remote is visible to a kd camera and appears in photos as a small light source in the operators hand see photo
hence if the operator of the remote includes themselves into a photo it is advisable to bounce the ir signal off of a surface such that the led on the remote does not appear conspicuous in photos taken with the deviceas stated by other reviewers the wireless remote control f is very small not much larger than the size of  sd memory cards end to end approximately twice as thick and easy to lose
therefore it would be very convenient and without altering the exterior dimension of the device if a small pass through sectional could be cut out from one of the corners and or modify the housing of the remote so a small key ring could loop through the remote
that way if a user is without a bg battery pack the wireless remote could be easily clipped and secured to a camera case or bagas a whole the price to value and function for the pentax wireless remote f is excellent and a device i recommend every kd user to haveminus  for ir transmitting led being visible to the kd cameraminus  for no secure storage method other than the bg battery packthis is a nice small remote  very small
i have a k and it works fine  the remote gives you a bit of flexibility when you need to take pics but need to be a bit away from the camera
it is an ok value  it is just a piece of plastic with one button and a small battery
pentax does not recommend changing the battery  but you can if needed  you just need a really small screwdriver
all in all  try and get this on sale and it is worth it
note  the bast battery grips from pentax used to store this remote  but the one for the k and k does not still holds an sd card thoughthe pentax remote control f does exactly what its supposed to do but is quite pricey for that functionality
its just an infrared remote not unlike what we use with our televisions
if you have a programmable universal remote or a pda with an infrared emitter you can actually program your own remote release
since universal remotes are all different youll have to find the code on the internet or use the manual search function of the remote
if you have a windows mobile pda go to your favorite search engine and enter pocketpc pentax remote control f without the quotespros very small and compact so you can easily store it
its about twice as long and just as wide as an sd card
ive uploaded a picture to the gallery above easy enough to use
for pentax digital slrs just set your drive mode to use the remote control
on the ist dlkd hit fn  up  ok to get to the drive mode menu wireless so you can easily participate in group pictures supports bulb mode on dslrs
this lets you take long exposures by holding down the remote release in b or bulb mode
i didnt actually expect this to work but it does
 supports autofocus in the auto modes auto pict green scn and any of the scene modes
you need to set af in remote control in the camera and the camera will focus before releasing the shutter
on my kd af in remote control was under the custom setting tab in the menu battery is replaceable but you need a small screwdriver kit to remove the backcons very small and compact so you can easily lose it doesnt support af in the manual modes p tv av m and b doesnt have a lock to hold down the shutter release for extended exposures requires line of sight since it uses infraredif you need a remote for long exposures i would suggest getting a wired remote because itll have a lock feature to hold down the button for you and the remote wont need line of sight to trigger the shutteraside from that the remote control f is a great addition to my camera bag
it makes it a lot easier for me to be in group pictures especially since i can easily conceal it so it doesnt show up in the photoi have the pentax kr dslr red and really enjoy it
i wanted a remote to get shots where i dont what my actions to affect the shot blur it in certain shots
the remote prevents this
its very easy to use
for pentax dslrs simply use the menu to get to the remote icon and activate it
once this is done simply click the remote the camera will shoot
one special note some dslrs will auto focus prior to the shot others will not the remote merely tells the cam to shoot the shot
in the second case just revert the camera back to manual focus an easy flick of the switch then use the remote
it just as well for methis is extremely simple one button no synching with your camera no programming
just put the camera in remote mode and hit the button
this comes with no instruction whatsoever probably because it is so simple
does what is is supposed to dopentax has made a very simple remote for my camera
my istdl doesnt have power zoom ability anyway so basically all i need is a shutter trigger anyway
it works just the way its supposed tothis remote is small and easily carriable
it functions smoothly
it does exactly as it is advertisedprosuseful for getting yourself in the image or remote triggering for tripod mounted long exposures
i use it a lot more than i thoguht i wouldconspossibly the price
i got it as part of a bundle with the battery grip for the kdadvicealways take the time to completely read the manual for the camera
although a lot of it will be boring and previously known the few tidbits you do get will help immensely
initially i did not know that a setting in the custom menu of the camera allowed for it to also focus in certain modesi have another wired remote which i use when i use a tripod but i wanted one that would fit in the base of my pentax k
this one works perfectly and the price was right
i was also shipped quickly
my only negative comment is that i wish the zoom worked with the remotethis remote is so small you can carry it in your pocket for those just in case times you would need it
the only drawbackis the small button is sometimes hard to find in the dark  a little bigger or taller would be helpfulit also is priced rightyou have to be in front of the camera for this thing to workkinda a pain but it at least keeps the camera from shaking when its on the tripodi was a little shocked by the price but felt i really needed it
the price has been reduced since then
i use it mostly for long exposures with the camera mounted on a tripod and group photos that include myself
pretty handy and very smallas in any shutterbugs arsenal one should always find a remote control for ones camera be it film or digital
this remote for my pentax kd is a welcomed addition
since i now look to shoot hdr images alot this is an absolute necessity
also comes in handy for portrait work since it frees you from looking thru the camera and enables you to get more candid shots
my only complaint is that it is rather small and that is a personal thing
hence the  stars
it may not be an issue with othersmy first amazon reviewafter many productive years of using a panasonic fz with a  aperture i finally went for the mighty pentax kd
at  the camera had a compelling iq to price ratio
i got  lenses to go with it the pentax smc da mm f al first edition the smc da mm f ed wr and this smc fa mm  primewhat a powerful tool this lens is
wide open it produces some really stunning bokeh
it has six blades which can give a hexagonal shape sometimes
it has really lovely rich colors and doesnt seem to have a lot of flare
wide open the speed is amazing you can go out at night and handhold using only street lights
yes  is a bit soft as all fast primes tend to be but ive still got some good results
stop down to  or  and it will get plenty sharp
focus is another story
using manual focus wide open is difficult
i will reserve judgment as it is new to me and i suspect it takes finesse and practice to master
ive had some trouble with the kds autofocus on this lens too
i think there is a frontfocus issue with my copy and i need to do a proper optical test and try the in camera focus adjustment feature on the kd to make corrections
i think the kds matte focus screen has a wider depth of field view as well
seriously thinking i need a splitscreen upgrade like the katzeye because of this
the shots i have managed to get in focus so far have been pleasingly sharp with brilliant bokeh and exceptional colors
with practice you will get great results with this lens
id give it  stars but for the crazy price jump here on amazon
i paid less then  for this lens elsewhere sorry amazon and feel this was money well spentpros great colors bokeh speed iq value if under cons overpriced challenging focusing wide openthis lens is soft at f but sharp at f
and it can handle low light
these i think everyone knows already
but f is not totally useless
if you like experimenting with waferthin depth of fields you can get plenty of interesting special effect shots
that is versatility for meeverybody needs a  and to learn to shoot with the  this just so happens to function a bit more like a mm on the kd but is still a  at its heart
look at some of the review sites and it is soft in the corners wide open but stopped down is a razor
the real issue is that the depth of field at  is negligable and therefore focus needs to be dead on
unfortunately the kd has the tendancy to backfocus with this lens
i would correct that but then it would ruin the focus with the kit lens i have
bummer
but with adequate light and at f it is superb
plus even if it is flawed it is unbeatable for the price
and it uses mm filters and could be part of an excellent system when combined with some of pentaxs other primes a system of the mm pancake the  and the mm wr macro comes to mind
check out the images to see what it can doits been months since i bought myself a mm f pentax lens the first fixed focal length slr lens in my arsenal
sure enough the first things i feel is how different if not difficult it is to change my way of shooting photographs especially when my everyday lens is the famously discontinued pentax mmbut that discomfort disappeared quickly when i started to know what this lens is good at
the impressive aperture and the shallow depth of field it brings is just so overwhelmingly amazing
it turned many of the ordinary shots into masterpieces at least in my eyes that is
for portrait photography the large aperture allows me to capture the slightest changes of my subjects emotions
their quick facial expression variation is only visible when you have a fast lens
that is particularly true when shooting family events or parties
after all not everyone has the privilege to ask a model to post for your camera again and againfor the bad side of the story pentax jacked up the price a few years ago
when similar lens of canon and nikon are selling at ish a  dollar comparison does not seem that much logical
that price eventually promotes the question constantly haunting my mind is the mm f a better deal for the moneyi dont to duplicate everything that dpreview did for this lens
they have an excellent review with detailed analysis of this lens
some quoted highlightspros  excellent image quality when stopped down to f and smaller very low lateral chromatic aberration almost no rectilinear distortioncons very soft wide open extremely busy rendition of outoffocus backgrounds at wider apertures larger than f bokeh chromatic aberration most visible at wide apertures ffshort is that this is a very good lens but if you want the best pictures you will want to not use it higher then f
the sigma mm f hsm for pentax would give you better wide aperature performance but you will pay for that as wellfor a very inexperienced photographer this lens was a good purchase
i recommend getting a prime lens to force you to move when composing your shots
and this lens has such a great depth of field when wide open you can get really creamy shots
im really happy with the performance as well
when shooting faces everything was very sharp and looked really great
the construction knocks off  star
the aperture ring can shift a tiny bit so that the camera thinks it isnt on automatic
you have to twist the ring back over to get it to register
i only have to do this a couple of times but its worth noting
the autofocus can be finicky if youre trying to shoot in really low lightphilips expanium exp takes everything

thinking about returningive bough this disk for my digital camera and it holds around    pictures with the highest quality and over a thousand in the lowest one
but my camera works extremely slowly with this disk compared to disks with lower capacityi have a canon s and this performs well for me had it for  months fast and no problem so farmy fatherinlaw has a nikon forgot the exact model  and seeing how it works well for me he also bought a viking  cf and he cant stop complaining
on his nikon the viking  cf does works very slowly like  seconds between shots compare to the lexar x mb cf that he has however when i put his viking  cf in my s it works flawlessly just like my viking  cf
so maybe nikons just doesnt work well with vikingsusing with coolpix  have not had the problems described by others with older coolpix models
there is some slowness in initially accessing the card when turning the camera on but no more than ive noticed with other comparable cards
the price on this cant be beat ive been pleased with the number of high resolution images ive been able to store with this card having purchased a couple makes life easier while traveling no need to constantly download imagessmartmedia is now outdated having been replaced by newer memory formats
however i have an old camera that i leave at work and this works great
instead of using a serial cable to download i just pull the card and use a card reader
now my old camera effectively uses usb  and with this  mb card im way ahead of the  mb card that originally came with the camera
i figured i couldnt pass up getting one of these before they are completely phased out and no longer availableive owned this card for about  months now using it in the nomad iic mp player as extended memory
ive written and rewritten to it more times than i can count and it gives excellent accurate playback performance every time
im bouncing the card by one star on the fact that i have yet to receive my  rebate check from viking
other than that no problems with the quality of this productthe card worked well with my olympus c digital camerai was able to use the card to hold  hq images x or  seconds of videoone problem i was not able to perform the initial formating in the camera
i had to format the card in the card reader attached to my pc
after that initial format i could reformat the card in the camerathis a good product for its price
for dollars you can add a modem or expand memory or add a wireless ethernet or ethernet or make your ipaq gps capable
but one thing product lacks is that it uses the battery of the ipaq so it reduces the time you can use the ipaq
the pc card expansion has its own battery so it helps the ipaq last a little longer
and the pc card expansion has more items that can be used with it
so you just have to see which is more usable for you the cf card expansion or the pc card expansion or none if you dont need the expansionsthis is the one to get
it is similar to the palm v competitor in that is is ultralight and has a built in rechargeable batteryits better than the palm v though lighter thinner has a screen that is protected far better than any of the palm pdas the lookup system is quicker and it has a similar battery to the palm v rechargeablea few drawbacks if you want to add all sorts of add ons via the springboard adapter you are going to destry the sleekness of this baby
also the stylus pen thingy can be tough to release at times
i wouldnt consider these major flaws though
overall get this pdawhen i first reviewed the sleek visor edge it cost about twice what it does today
at the time i advised buyers that this product was definitely going to come down in price so it can compete
handspring finally has priced this product where it is extremely competitive with any product in the marketplacefunctionally the visor edges sole advantage is its thinness
it is by far the thinnest pdafunctionally the edge is identical to the visor neo except it is thinner with a rechargeable battery
this is the palm os equivalent of the apple cube  a beautiful machine that didnt justify its high initial cost
as with the cube after it was discontinued you can now get a great deal on the edgebuyers may also want to check out the discontinued palm vx which feels better in your hands and actually weighs about an ounce lessbtw putting the springboard module on this product makes it look totally unwieldy and eliminates the quotcoolquot factor
if you like springboard keep your visor deluxeneothe learning curve for this pda is about as short as it gets
many functions that are extremely useable for most students as well as business people
database products available to create your own lists and functionality
durable and hotsyncs easily with all windows products
recharges in the cradle in a very short period of time and holds the charge exceptionally well compared to most color type screens
for the money and memory size this ones hard to beatoverall very nice
tactile feel is very good
my only gripe is its actually larger than a standard keyboard the keys are a bit larger which makes the overall length longer
so i find myself hitting the single quote key rather than the carriage return keythe targus folding keyboard they make one for just about every pda on the market is a must have addition for anyone who will do even moderate data entry on a pdathe keyboard itself is fantastic
when folded it takes up about the same space as your ipaq and weighs a bit less
when unfolded it is just a wonderful feeling keyboard
the keys are nice and large the layout is just like a normal desktop keyboard and the key travel feels like most laptops
touch typists and huntpeck people should have no trouble adapting to thisso why only give it  stars
because i own a  and the the  and  series ipaqs changed the connector on the bottom of the unit
targus instead of making two different keyboards decided to make an adapter for the  ipaqs
the adapter is a quot long thingy that is just begging to be lost
so it drops a star for that
on the other hand targus has an extremely nice customer service department that shipped me three extra adapters at no chargein short if you use your pda for just about anything get this keyboard
you wont regret iti recently upgraded to the compaq ipaq from my beloved but battered old palm iii
what a difference
but adding the stowaway keyboard was the crowning touch to the new machine for i can now use it as a laptop replacement on most business trips
when i take business trips i usually need email access and light word processing
with pocket versions of outlook and word the ipaq meets that need but anything beyond the shortest messages or notes is hard to enter using either character recognition or the soft keyboard
but with a stowaway keyboard attached entering extensive notes and writing long emails is a breeze
i was at a conference this past weekend at which everybody around me was using lap tops
i zipped out my stowaway keyboard whipped it open snapped on my palm and was the envy of everyone in sightthe stowaway keyboard is really a remarkable device
it folds down to next to nothing  smaller than a paperback novel
it slips easily into a jacket pocket
yet it unfolds into a near fullsize keyboard with remarkably accurate and lifelikequot action
it is actually easier to type on the stowaway keyboard than on my dell laptop
taking notes or entering multiple contact data let alone writing emails of any length is now a breezewhy did i subtract one star
mainly because i have been unable to get the keyboard to hot dock which is supposedly can do
also the keyboard cannot be used on your lap or other soft surface
unless you have it on a hard surface it tends to sag in the middle
finally why is there no delete key
those quibbles aside however i highly recommend it to any power ipaq useri have used these cameras many times on vacation and the pictures really did come out fairly well
oh sure the quality of the pictures wont be  as good as the pictures you would get from a digital camera or a standard more expensive and more professional  mm camera
the pictures may at times be very slightly grainy but they provide excellent records and memories of my experienceseach camera is also very lightweight so you can carry several at a time in a bag as you travel
i especially like the built in flash that is easy to use just push a button in the back of the camera and after  seconds or so the flash is ready
i remember my mothers kodak instamatic camera from the s when if your flash cube had been used after only four pictures you were out of luck unless you had another flash cube
no such problem here
thank goodnessone cautionary note however amazon correctly notes that the best flash range is when youre taking pictures of people or things between  feet and  feet away
remember that to get the best use out of the flashthe camera is a single use camera this means that after you use it you take the entire camera to the place where you can get film developed and they will take care of the rest
no worrying about whether or not you removed the roll of film negatives correctly without exposing them to too much light
the kodak max  film speed also makes it useful for taking pictures under a wide variety of lighting situations
you get  exposures not just a nice plus
smileoverall this is an excellent camera for the many many people who want to travel light or who are on a budget
it is compact and easy to carry keep one in the glove compartment of your car just in case theres an accident and you need to take pictures of the scene
the camera is also affordable
i give it four stars instead of five simply because the picture quality just isnt the very best although for most people like me the pictures it takes are fine
thank you kodakplays dvds without a hitch
quite nice looking also
the only fault i can find with it is that it does not recall where you were in a dvd when you stop and turn it offi havent encountered the dreaded hh error but i dont give this dvd player as much mileage as others probably do
i love this player thoughpros  great video and sound from what a non video professionals point of view  has played most of my mp cdrs with no problems making it a good option for parties  nice to have optical sound out and component video at this price i just bought an onkyo ht system and plugged everything in and it worked without any glitches now only if my tv would support hd   good set of features for the pricecons  nothing that really bothers me too much but the remote could be designed betteri dont know about the complaints of others but i would recommend this player and hope everyone enjoys it as much as i have and willi use this for the bedroom inch sony tv without external speakers
one of the first things that impressed me was the sound quality afforded by the tvs small speakers with this player
the surround sound option literally projects the sound out into the room
sound effects like im only used to hearing on a home theatre system are discernable with this player
it also has a powered subwoofer output which tempts me to buy one for this tv
since im using it with just a inch monitor theres not too much i can say about the picture quality its fine
the remote control is intuitive and easy to use i found myself reaching for reading glasses every time i wanted to use the philips remote for another machine
ive had no trouble playing disks even badly scratched rentals
this player has a memory feature that allows you to resume play on a single disk after turning off the unit
this took a couple tries to figure out not that intuitive but i use it oftenyou get a dvdvcdcd player with mp cdr and cdrw playback
thats too good
if you have a burner and a interbet connection than you can enjoy the mp playback
if not than get another dvd player that can cost  less for one without an mp playbackfor the price and features it has
this a great dvd player
this unit can play most cd format
cd dvd mp vcd cdr and cdrw
it also have a jog dial for scanning which makes it more convenient to accessi have a problem with the delay it has when changing tracks when playing cd
it is not the same with my other players where it is instant when the tracks are changed
i have to virtual point the remote at it to respond to my commandother than that this is a great  disc machineok this worked for me for the h error september  reviewer silversvt see more about me from oklahomaafter yr and months of use i got the h error and no matter what i tried it wouldnt work
so i took off the case spun the plastic gear on top of the eject tray
i also turned the plastic gears inside of the tray
then i opended the tray and inserted a dvd
just as soon as the machine took the dvd in and closed i pushed down on the center of the plastic wheel on top of the tray and spun it
the dvd player picked up on the spin i gave it and began accelerating and has worked ever sincejust thought i would share with everyone and see if it works for youjasongood grief i got the h error as well just over a year and  months and with the tips above i was able to fix the darn thing thanks to the reviewer jason above hes a genuius
fyi this is a pretty good player all and all its quiet and responsiveupdate  i take the above comment back its still dead no can do got a sony now
nough said
oafter trial and error and considerable research i narrowed down my choices to the sony s and the panasonic rv
then i discovered this model the rv
despite the higher retail prices of the previous models its important to remember that international exchange rates production efficiency and greater consumer demand enable manufacturers to sell the newer improved versions at lower prices
amazons pricing incidentally reflects the commoditys inherent quotvaluequot far more accurately than other sellers who are likely to have the rv priced higher than the rv simply because the sellers initial cost was higher
i was leaning to the sony primarily because of its sleek yet modest face and ultracompact design the thinnest and least deep
but for all its consumerseducing bells and whistles a quotcinema modequot button
how many times is a dvd not a movie
 the rv is still the inescapable choice in this price range
the ability to play variously encoded cds the discstabilizing feature the shuttle control for fast scanning all represent advances in quality and convenience
and despite its more quotgaudyquot face the machines  dimensions  are almost as compact as the sonyson the quotdownquot side the remote like virtually all others ive tried does not allow me to access my  television sets menu which must be set to quotauxilliary modequot for the player to work at least if you plan to continue using a vcr
but most viewers by now have become accustomed to using  or  remotes anyway
if not the minimal exercise involved in walking to the set should not prove injurious to anyones healthive owned this player for three years with no problems
there was a short period of time where the transport started to get loud and then it just got quiet again
otherwise its been great for the little money i paid for it
since its three years old ill be looking for a replacement that has the zoom feature and can read mp tracks with all the encoded track information
i have played several dvdrs on the drive and they work flawlesslythis is a great dvd player
it has everything you want even comes with dts and mp at a price you cant beat
its such a good buy
its easy to set up and easy to use
a great first dvd player for anyone who is thinking of getting a dvd player
i wouldnt use it on my hdtv home theater but if you just want something simple that looks great this is the one
it has good sound and picture for the price
havent had any problems with it what can i say i love it
it was coolbig truckthis is a great unit for a great price
it comes with a nat firewall too
the setup was easy and painlessinitial setup was a bit nasty
i had two pcs that i wanted to network
both could go online but not talk to each other
i disabled zonealarm on the main pc
and then it was flawless
i also have my tivo on the network with the lynksis usb network adaptor and all the equipment are chating away with each other quite nicely
the other pc
states that connection is excellent but i lose about  percent of throughput from my cable modem but that still is over mps
the tivo streams the mps and photos relatively well but ocaisanly hiccups especially on the music but this is a minor irritant
the cost benefit equation on this product is outstanding if you take the time to read the manualonce i downgraded the firmware came with  and download was  worked great
good reception throughout my  sq ft condo
very cool to sit on my couch laptop in hand with no cordscables and be able to surf the netthis router has worked well for me
there seem to be many bad reviews but a few of them seem to be from incompetent usersthe web interface for configuring it is pretty good but you may have to play with settings
it simply cant guess the information it needs
you may have to talk to someone who understands routershaving any routerfirewall between you and the internet may interere with certain programs connecting to the internet
thats kind of the point
making these programs work may require a little extra tweakingfinally walls floors and other electronics using the same frequency will interfere with your wireless signal to varying degrees
if you have a large house or lots of obstructions you may want to also get a wireless access point to cover more area
wireless routers tend to have more horizontal range than vertical this is a pretty good router which should serve the needs of most people
it provides some security and lets you get all your computers onlinethis router is serving a cable connection at my uncles house and has been for at least  year
the one apple computer in his house powerbook g  is the only computer that works consistently with it
the xp box his son has is constantly bringing down the whole system because the thing is a security seiveanyway sometimes this router spontaneously reverts to a slower connection speed but this can be easily fixed from the mac using the admin web pagethis router works fine with apple computers
people who say otherwise dont know what they are talking aboutif you are in the market for a router for your broadband connection i would give serious thought to this product
it takes linksyss  port routerswitch and adds a wireless access point
and if you check the price its about the same cost as a stand alone access point
if you want to connect several pcs in different rooms or be able to work on a laptop from any room in your house i would highly recomend this productthe only reason that i didnt give this product  starts was the wireless abilties of this product
while it works great for surfing the web it does seem slower than access points from cisco but at about  the cost
for price  performance this product rocks
i only notice the slowdown when i transfer large files m so for your day to day duties the speed is fine
as for the distance i can go anywhere in my home with my laptop and still be connected
i would also like to note that i am using a cisco pc card
also i have a very open floor plan that helpsif you do decide on this product there are  things that you need to do as soon as you turn it on
these are security issues that need to be addressed
first change the essid
this will prevent your neighbors from connecting to your network if they have the same product
second enable des
this will encript the data and will make it almost impossible to connect to your home networkone final note if you are using a notebook that your employer supplied you with check with your itis department before you start making changes to the configuration
we would rather answer your questions and help you before you break it then afteri have tried a couple of other brands like d link and netgear
linksys is by far the best when it comes to wirelress throughput
i upgraded the firmware to the latest and once or twice a month i had to resetpowercycle the router because the router freezes and the pcs lose connectivity
then i decided to downgrade to   and i dont have the problem any morethis unit accomodates both hard wired networks up to  devices and wireless networks use the linksys cards  others may not be compatible and serves as a router and access point
setting it up was incredibly simple i updated the firmware right away and the default settings worked perfectly with my cable road runner isp
i did implement mac cloning on advice from the linksys website a great source for info on configuring this for various dslcable isps later just in case
this was easy with the webbased configuration softwareyou do have to know how your isp works
im assuming i could not disable dhcp because road runner uses it
since i couldnt give my machines static ip addresses i sometimes have to change the port forwarding configurations depending on which ip address the router assigns each machine we turn off the machines at night
you also need to reconfigure some of your internet software to work behind a firewall if they havent been set that way all ready
and in some cases i had to disable my personal firewalls we use sygate atguard or zone alarm for internet software to work particularly ftp clientsthe wireless range we have  hard wired computers and a couple of wireless laptops is not spectacular  radius but adequate for our purposes
would have appreciated some input from the manufacturer about effective placement of the unit for optimal wireless performanceif youre willing to do a little tweaking now and then and dont need extensive wireless range this is a great allpurpose devicesimple quick and easy to use half the time i forget its there
a nice piece of equipment you will forget you own because youll never need to look at it or touch iti even went with the default config just to make it that much easier i just opened the box and added electricity doneive had this router for nearly a year now and its given me no problems from the start
it was pretty easy to set up and the signals are pretty good from the computer downstairs
it isnt as fast as g but it gets the job done if your just looking for simple router for internet access and simple networking
the  ethernet ports on the back are also a plus for those looking to create a wirelesswired hybrid network
i highly recommend this as itll do the job for most peoplei beat my head against a rather obscure bug for about  weeks before calling linksys support
i have two machines hooked to the switch and was using a linksys wireless pc card and all was fine
i had heard lucent orinoco cards had better range and switched to the lucent only to experience some really strange behavior
turns out that one of the two machines i had on the switch was using a dec  ethernet controller chip which i was told was incompatable
i could not believe it
why were things working fine with the linksys wireless card and not the orinoco
incredulous i swapped out the card in my other machine
it suddenly started working
the strange thing was that the card with the dec chip was made by linksys
other than that bit of weirdness the product is greati bought the befws to replace my nonwireless linksys befsr which i liked a lot
set up was fairly straight forward but you must remember to set your wireless clients to use the quotinfrastructurequot otherwise youll get no connection to the access point
tested with the linksys wpc card on both a compaq presario xl winmewin notebook and a dell inspiron  laptop win
in my  sq
ft house the reception was good or excellent throughout
i was relieved to see the firewallrouting features were identical to that of the befsr with an additional feature of allowing you to change the wan adaptors mac address so i did not have to call up my cable modem service to register the new addressthe online help files provided are very poor some of the wireless cards online help say quotinsert detailed description of this tab herequot
i am curious as to how well other wireless cards will hook up to this devicei tried the smc barricade thought about the nexland wavebase and ended up with the linksys
the expense of the wavebase  lack of comparative reviews ruled that one out
the smc range was not that good in my space lath and plaster  it slowed my dsl connection over time requiring periodic resets
at the time id upgraded it to the most recent firmware
it did have nice security features which i appreciatedthe linksys version  however went the distance pun intended
i tried the version  and was happy with that but v had even better range
what i do not like about the linksys is its lack of basic security features
though there is support for wep the type of mac filtering available isnt really helpful for keeping out computers
we all know that b is a security hole waiting to be exploited
i just assume put as many locks on as possible weak or not
if you do a search for wireless network security some basic things are always listed
not only are these not really supported by the linksys but in my experience linksys tech support was fairly clueless about how to secure the router from wardriving
i have read that a recent firmware release for the v is available to address some of these issues but i have read mixed reviews
ill wait a bit and see how it matures
for what its worth i run it wired and wireless on an orinoco gold mostly for sharing a pppoe dsl connection and rarely do much file and print sharingi have since upgraded to the most recent official firmware and am pleased that the security features that i have been looking for have now been included
the mac filtering that i was waiting for is a little hard to find as it is in the advancedwireless area under the title station mac filter
and at the time of my install there were no instructions available for the new features
im not sure if there are nowi recently purchased the linksys wireless cable dsl router
it has been working great and was relatively easy to setup for my home network running dsl
while aware that the customer support line for any product can be a harrowing experience mine totaled almost  hours
the tech stayed with the problem for close to an hour however it was difficult to get bumped to the next level of supportregarding the call  there was one odd issue after the router was configured
i was able to receive email and browse the internet
however i was not able to send email ftp or use my weblogging software package
after exhausting selffixes port forwarding etc
i caved and called customer support
 minuted to get a live technician and then almost an hour to diagnose and solve the problemfor those of you that may have similar problems adjusting the size of the mtu may fix some bottleneck problems sending data outoverall the product has been running smoothly since then with no complaints
stats machines wired windows  desktop linux server and a wireless laptop with lucent orinoco wireless cardi was able to enable wep encryption fairly easily for higher wireless security
port forwarding is operational to my linux server easy configurationsharing files and my printer has worked alsoexcellent product nobrainer installation
configuration is straightforward
with the latest firmware released on  you have got bit wep supportfact wireless networking can be very complex
there are many standards and the terminology can be confusing
this router works very well and is relatively simple
i had the router  pcs one hardwired and one wireless installed and operational within  minuteswhen using any residential router be sure you install the latest firmwarebe sure you enable wep for security
it is turned off by default
for most users  bit encryption is sufficienti like the way linksys uses a quotkey phasequot approach to generating the key
i suggest you randomly open a favorite book and use the first sentence from a random paragraph
this avoids using something easily quessedi own the linksys wmp pci card and a linksys wireless port cabledsl router
i had a  ethernet card in my machine and was running off of the router for a good long time so i knew the router settings were correct before i went to install my wireless cardwhen the day came i disconnected the wired network installed the wireless software and put the card in my machine
i powered back up and although i had  signal strength and  signal quality the link was terrible  i could only download a few kb of data before losing a link and i couldnt even connect to my routers configuration pagei made a quick call to technical support and they suggested that i upgrade my drivers and firmware in both products
i was skeptical but i did anyway and it worked just fine
since then ive moved my router to the basement two floors below my computer with floors and walls in the way and youd never even know
i run with good signal strength and quality and i never notice loss of connection or errors on downloads
ive been very very pleased with this purchaseive used this product for over a year now and its been the most reliable router ive ever owned
i suspect that most everyone whos having a problem with it has hooked it up themselves with no prior experience doing so and has not configured it properly
take the time to contact linksys to set it up correctly and youll have a worryfree wireless network for years to come see caveat belowthe only reason im giving it four stars is because it is not compatible with my new laptop which is running vista home premium
if youre running xp do not hesitate to get this routeri bought this router a few weeks ago when i purchased my new g ibook on the recommendation of a coworker
i was originally planning to buy an airport station but its additional features such as a builtin modem are really of no use to me
so i decided to save the  and go with the linksys
i also went for b over g since the speed of my connection is limited by my dsl line and im not going to be doing a lot of filesharing among my computers so there didnt seem to be much sense to spend the extra moneyive had the router set up for a couple of weeks now and everything is working like a dream
i have an imac and a pc connected to it with ethernet cables and then i have my ibook with an airport extreme card
setup was fairly easy  its done through your internet browser i did not install any of the included software
my ibook immediately recognized the network when i fired it up and reception appears to be fine throughout my story housea word of caution the router runs on a ghz frequency so there is interference with cordless phones that run on the same frequency
ive given the product four stars because a day or two ago none of the computers were recognizing the internet connection but plugging and unplugging the ethernet cable out of the back of the router seemed to fix that problem oddly enough
its not a huge inconveniece but i hope it doesnt happen oftenim also thinking about purchasing a wireless usb adapter the linksys wusb for my tivo to add to the fun  no more slow phone downloading of program infolets call this rating  stars  i purchased the befws router along with the linksys pcmcia card for my home desktop system and laptop respectively
basically i wanted the ability to surf the web from my laptop anywhere in the house in bed on the sofa watching tv etc
using the wireless connection but also have the hardwire ports available as a backup
im using the wired port from my desktop that is located  feet away in another part of the house where the dsl linemodem live but the wireless connection via my laptop to write this review
all i can say is so far so good and no real complaints
the only reason i didnt give it  stars was some of the setupconfig i had to do eventually wasnt covered in the manual and i had to call tech support at  number to get up and running
the quickstart setup and driver installation takes about five minutes total for both the router and the card and i had absolutely no trouble following the directions
i knew the card was connecting as it was clearly getting a signal and there were a couple tweaks that the tech support operator helped with immediately
the basic problem i had was with dns  i had to enter some basic dns server settings in both the router and the cards tcpip properties and immediately began surfing the web
pretty cool
tech support was solid responsive friendly  but like most these days really overworked
it took me a day to get a callback but once i did no problems
they even gave me some good advice for extending the range of the wireless service such as trying different channels antenna positions and downloading a new driver from the company web site
thats something none of the other reviewers who had problems mentioned trying but very sensible
i should also say that i consider myself a novice network admin at best
the real selling points for me were the pricefeature set and the pc world quotbest buyquot recommendation
the  in rebates i got at the time i purchased were an unexpected bonus but unfortunately no longer offered
ok so it wasnt  percent plugandplay but anyone who deals with networking  home or office  will tell you some minor tweaking is to be expected
dont be discouraged or let this prevent you from diving in  im glad i didi found that this product was very nice indeed
it works it sends out a good signal and it kept up to speed with the cable company i had
however there were a few cons about it
for one at moments i would randomly get disconnected whether i would be console gaming or hooked with a wire on a pc
that would really be the only con and i would have to restart it o fix the problem
overall i give this router a  out of i recently purchased one of these from compusa they also had a mailin rebate on them and for the most part it works perfectly
setup was very simple although some of the more advanced options like mac address cloning are a little awkward unless you page through the manual a few times and  amazingly  i got both my girlfriends brand new dell notebook and her mothers ancient power mac connected through it to the net within  minutes and without a hitch i have done this before to be fair but its my first experience with an b router
the wireless range seems good you shouldnt expect much more than about  of range indoors what with the walls power wires microwave ovens etc
all over the place and web surfing from a different floor was pretty smooth
placing the router centrally helps as does putting it in the open  sticking it in the corner under a desk with a mess of noisy wires around it will give you very poor signal quality
also if you need more range the dual antennas can be removed and replaced with better ones  something you dont often see in entrylevel wireless hardwarehowever i cant give this a star rating because as several other people have noted it seems to randomly disconnect and stop responding after running for a while the wireless notebook can quotseequot the router but cant establish a connection to it
if you hit the quotresetquot button or unplug it and then plug it back in it works fine for a while and then stops again
i havent had time to contact linksys support and it may just be a problem with their also very old cable modem but its certainly very annoyingi installed my unit to serve as a router for my cable modem and to act as lan router between my three home computers
i set it up in a peertopeer network using windows  professional on one and win se on the other two
the wink computer is hooked to the router via a base cate cable and the other two computers use linksyss usb wireless access point controllersthe router is easily managed via the web browser on your computer and setup was relatively easy for this beginner
the primary problems were caused by my firewall software symantec and were resolved easily
i am now able to access the net from all computers at between  and  mbs and transfer files etc
the computers are about  and  feet from the wireless router and speed is always very goodwhile a wired setup is always best i did not want to run wires everywhere and i wanted the flexibility to move things around
security is good as the linksys has bit wep capabilitya good product at a decent pricethis is a good product for the beginner to use for their first wireless network
i had stubbornly resisted going wireless as the dsl ethernet router and my own wiring worked just fine then my daughter got a laptop with wireless capability followed soon by my wife
presto chango we needed wirelessinstallation and setup was painless
from what ive read the earlier versions of this product had problems in this area but from version  on they seem to be resolved
were using  of the  wire ports no need to buy extra wireless ethernet cards along with the wireless capabilitythe best validation of the units performance might be from the night when i came out of the office after working on the net for a while wireline and passed through the living room to see my daughter and two friends lounging on the floor about as far away from the router as you can get in our house all happily browsing away wirelessly on their notebook computersone interesting side note i confess to checking the prices of this same item on a popular auction site
there were a number of sellers that claimed to have new units still in the box however without the bar code on the side of the box
my investigative curiosity was aroused enough to go check out the linksys web site where i learned that there was a manufacture rebate that was available
to make  a long story short i bought my router through amazon sent in the rebate form and ended up with a final cost that was  less than anything available through the auction sight
count me as a happy customerthis device works as advertised and has a good web interface with which to work
all in all im very happy with this product
i would have liked a bit more range but for the money this device has worked well for me
i found some db gain antennas from radio shack for  dollars which increases the range of this device so that may be an option for some folkssetting up the router was impossible using the nic card in the port replicator of my dell machine
this led to massive frustration
however it was smooth as silk using the nic card in the sony vaio
the port replicator nic card just refused to save the configuration settings even after upgrading the firmware
after programming the router with the browser based utility on the vaio operation was nearly instantaneous
hooking up additional computers to the router was a breeze
it just works
i havent had as much luck with the linksys wireless nic card
its manual is full of errors and has scant descriptions for roubleshooting
i have also noticed drastic speed reductions going through the port replicator nic card as much as x
i am unsure as to why this is happening and maybe dell customer support will helpwow if you want wireless this is the way to go
after picking up my new laptop and all other accessories to go with it including this router by linksys i will never recommend another to set up in your homeit was so simple to setup plug the network cable into the router from the cabledsl modem plug the network cable into the computer from the router throw the disk in the computer bam
youre done
this was all done with the windows  pro machine still running
everything has run flawlessly
i live in a  sq
ft home and i can go anywhere with this router hooked upwhy i gave it four stars i run a web page off of my computer and its been hell trying to figure out how to get that up and running
i found out i need to shut dhcp off but when i do that i loose the laptop when i restart it
any help out there
this has truly got to be what anyone wanting to go wireless needs
its better than paying another company to set it up
its just so simpleokay update
on  a month since i bought it it stopped working
i tried everything in the book to get it working again nothing
today  i finally called linksys tried everything they said and now the cable modem cant even see it
they have to send me a new one well see how that works out
they do have very nice customer support though and they do everything to make you happy
in being on the phone for less than  minutes they set me up to have the new one mailed to me  just make sure to keep your receiptmy roommate had this up and running in  mins along with one pci card and one pcmcia card on the networkmy only gripe is that it does not have a printer port and print server capability
i dropped it down  star for thatmy main reason for setting up a wireless network was to be able to share a broadband internet connection with three pcs
after  months of hell weak signals lost signals etc
i finally got the right person at linksys technical support who recognized immediately that the router was defective
after a nohassle return i had a new router within a week and am now running smoothly
be aware that this was not easy to set up and youll probably be making some calls to technical support still free and for the most part helpfulbut in the end youll be happy
i know that some reviewers have complained about range  currently the router is quothardwiredquot to a pc on the second floor
i have wireless cards on one pc which is also on the second floor and another on the first floor and opposite end of the house
occasionally ill take a notebook out on the patio with no signal problemsthis is a nice multifeature device that works great once you get it configured
unfortunately the user guide is written for network engineers
i can do lots of pc stuff wipe a hard drive reload windows add or replace internal hardware but i know nothing of networks
the user guide is missing some key info and wrong on others
however there is tollfree support and i got expert help after an minute wait
not bad
but the documentation is inexcusable
not only is it incomplete but it is only for win  amp me
if you have nt or  they offer no instruction at allhad some trouble getting online until i realized someone else in our apt
building was sitting on the same channel
quick channel switch and everything went smoothly
works fine with macs and pcsthe range is much better than the slightly cheaper netgear solution
solid productonly rant
always could use a bit more rangelinksys befws  i received this unit from my wife for christmas in   i had it connected to my cable modem on the th
the documentation was a little sparse but i was able to get the thing going pretty quickwhen i first had it set up i was able to see the internet on all my machines but they could not see each other
turns out having windows xp professional on all the computers was part of my problemfile sharing and permissions have to be set up correctly for the computers to share their info
lets blame that one on pilot error   visiting microsofts expertzone for networking tips led me down the correct pathi encountered troubles on my second day of ownership when my cable modem provider comcast switched over to their own service from home which is going bankrupt
i was still able to see my network in the house one laptop with a wireless pc card from orinoco my desktop which was connected to the router directly and my daughters desktop downstairs in the kitchen with a linksys wireless usb adapter see my review on that puppy awesome so i knew the issue was in one of my new settings with comcasts distribution of ip addressesgoing into the setup i found that even though i had told the router to obtain an ip address automatically it would not or could not
it just told me my wan address was   not a good address for the nethooking my cable modem directly to my computer instantly allowed me to obtain an ip address and internet connectivity
i used ipconfig in a command prompt to get my new ip address then went into my network connections to get my physical address mac address of my network cardi then hooked up my router to the computer and the cable modem to the router
i used the linksys control screen advanced settings to clone my network cards mac address in case comcast needed the actual address of the card they supplied
i then manually entered the ip address and dns i found earlier with ipconfig and network connections
bingo i was on the net through my routerknowing my ip address said the lease was set to expire in one week i didnt want to wait a week and have to do this all over again
so i reset the router to obtain an ip address automatically and powered down my entire computer cable modem includedpowering back up the router found a new ip address and my entire network of three computers was set up and running on the internet
i am not sure if spoofing my mac address was really necessary but i left it as is and the network runs great
wireless is the way to go if you can spare the extra money when compared to pulling wires
i get about  mbsec connectivity from my daughters desktop down ion the kitchen one floor down while the linksys router is upstairs in my office
i get the same for my laptop when i am down on the couch in the living room
when it warms up here in new jersey ill think of heading into the yard with the laptop to check on connectivity range outside the houserongoltsch at hotmail dot comthis is my nd befws
the first one i had was a version  and this one is a version  there are a few differencesfirst of all the newer model is smaller not as tall and it has fewer leds only  per ethernet connection vs  on the older modelotherwise the main difference seems to be the range
i have noticed a considerably better signal since the change with my wireless tivo at the far end of the house having averaged about a  connection quality previously and now showing a  connection steadilysetup is identical and i find i do have some experience with these routers so maybe im just getting better with them it fairly intuitive
just plug it in and type in  on your address bar and voila youre into the system
it may take a little trial and error but especially with dynamic ips its pretty foolprooflastly i suppose as a consequence of competition the price has dropped a lot
if you have a combination wired  wireless network you can hardly go wrong with the new linksysill admit i was very skeptical of this wireless wunderkind when i read the first reviews
a relatively cheap alternative to a hardwired home network but would it work reliably
the answer is an overwhelming yes
ive read many of the other reviews here denegrating this routers performance and mechanics
maybe im just lucky but ive been very pleased with this wireless peripheralincluding the required purchase of a wireless network card this allinone peripheral provides a wireless pc connection as well as wired ethernet pcs access to a single broadband net connection
this wireless router allows for sharing of ip addresses files printers and other network resources i use this product specifically for a wireless highspeed net connection to my desktop pc cable connectioni have my compaq presario  notebook win me networked to my gateway p desktop win v without compatability issuesthis router works extremely well without dropping the connection well within the distance limitations reflected in the linksys documentation although the advertised  ft maximum would be pushing it well past the envelope in my opinion
i have tested these distance limitations extensively
my desktoprouter is located in my upstairs office while i operate my notebook downstairs
estimating i suspect the working distance is easily  lineal feet with several walls and a floor to pass through
to test these limitations further ive even taken the notebook to my garage with limited degradation the lengthsignal strength icon moved to quotyellowquot signifying a questionable link albeit workableas with any shared connection youll see some speed degradation as compared to the hardwired primary desktop from timetotime but not enough to really matter
many purists will disagree with me but this fixed onetime cost beats the cost of hardwiring a home network and monthly cable costs any time
amortizing the hard costs relative to monthly cable costs and initial installation can be achieved in a minimum of  months in many cases depending on location and service providers ie
after  months youre dollars ahead
conclusion a very solid wireless perhipheral for those desiring a second cabledsl connection without the monthly cost
an outstanding valuefirst  an overview the unit works great and installation wasnt really a problem only an irritationi have cable modem service that cranks out a pretty decent downstream speed
i needed both security and wireless options so i bought this unit bundled with a b notebook card pcmcia
as soon as i got this out of the box plugged in the connections and plugged the unit in it worked getting the internet service to my desktop
the software installation was a breezethen i needed to get the wireless up and running
that was more of a challenge
i followed the instructions which was illustrative but lacking in detail and got the wireless base transmitting
then after installing the software into the laptop i inserted the card and after a bit the card picked up the wireless signal
the only small issue was that the installation program didnt tell windows xp laptop to not look for more drivers to install when the card is inserted
that was mildly irritating but nothing to get upset over
my laptop worked great kept a good signal and i was surfing in the living room on a lazy boy in about  minutes
that night i installed the software in her laptop and after a bit more trouble than i had with mine got it up and runningthe signal never dropped and worked through walls while appliances tv water cooler ac etc
came on and off
that was with an unsecure broadcast
so a day or two later i decided to make the broadcast secure but couldnt quite figure it out
the instructions didnt help and when i did what i thought i needed to the signal didnt get picked up on the laptop
so i called customer support and got through fairly quickly
the lady on the other end was helpful and after about  minutes of explanation and pushing the right buttons we got it going
her english wasnt great but she could communicate spoken words well  just not letters when it came to clearing the network settings in the dos do they still call it that
prompt
oh well  minutes after i placed the call i was back online and working with a secure connectionthe unit and card work great and so far are deserving of  stars
the documentation is what bumps this thing down for me
the biggest irritation is that a manual would have made things a snap for me
though i know little about wireless ive built computers and administered networks
however i will say that if there must be something lacking along the lines of product documentation or support im glad its documentation and not the other twoif you get this and have some trouble just pick up the phone
before you do though get familiar with the ip commands in your command prompt eg
ipconfig etc
that may help if the technician has a hard time pronouncing english letters clearlyi have cable modem internet access through insight digital
i chose this means to connect because i needed a fast connection and i wanted the ability to network two pcs from this single connection
originally based on the advice of someone at best buy i bought a netgear switch
the switch was able to get both pcs running but every so often it would quotlosequot one machine and then i had to reboot  a total pain to say the leastfinally i ordered this router from amazon
unfortunately i followed all of the directions right out of the box and couldnt get it to work properly
i called linksys support and the tech guy couldnt get it to work either so he said ship it back to amazon
here is where the difficulties began
i was moving that week and the box containing the dead router got buried and i didnt find it until weeks later
amazon wont take back electronics after  days so i was in the hands of the linksys warranty department
to their credit they cross shipped my replacement router to me as the dead one was shipping back to them
the new unit installed perfectly and my wireless home network is up and running smoothlyi really like the features of this router
the wireless range is great  my two networked pcs are on two different floors of my house and the signal strength is excellent
the router came with some serious security and management software and a highly configurable firewall
overall now that i have a unit that works i am highly pleased with this purchase for its price and its ability to do what i want it to doi bought this router last december
got it up and running in less than  minutes after my cable connection was installed
i had two win desktops one with cat and one with wireless connection and a linux laptop on the routers network
they all worked and were able to access internet and share files among themselvesi had been using vpn for telecommuting and after the router was installed the vpn appeared working as well at least initially
i was able to access company network and saw remote unix file system using linux nfs
when i tried to actually access files or subdirectories the nfs broke down and i could not even shutdown the linux laptop nfs was not able to unmount the remote file system that i viewedthe second problem i encountered with the router was that the wireless connection would sometime jam the router for no reason and all the network traffic would stop
the only way out was to press the reset button on the back of the routerboth problems were resolved after i upgraded the router to the latest firmware
if you use vpn you definitely want to upgrade to the latest firmware
other than these initial problems this has been a great product for my needsi bought this product when it was on sale at bestbuy
it is a good product but goes down once a month and you have to restart it
the signal is good around the apartment
i like the web configuration interface
overall i recommend itafter getting dismal range with my airport base station i finally decided to go with a toprated wireless cabledsl router and settled on the linksys noted above
from plugging it in to having my macintosh find it the entire process was an absolute breeze
its browserbased administration is not platform dependent so being on a mac wasnt an issue
what was an issue was not finding any documentation whatsoever on connecting a mac and setting up printers to work with the built in router
after extensive online searching i found that linksys doesnt support appletalk and that was why i couldnt find my printers in the network control panel
i could print to them using ip printingyou have to know each printers ip addresswhich the router gladly gave them but that was just a little bit too much work for any user
from what ive read linksys has said they are going to come out with a firmware update that provides appletalk support but its late in coming
as far as im concerned they are missing a huge opportunity with mac users since many other wireless routers provide this networking protocol
apples base station is almost twice as expensive has three less lan ports and provides a paltry  feet of range if youre lucky
the linksys gives  feet indoor and  feet outdoor and its dual antennas are adjustable to provide maximum connectivity and signal strength
i wish it came with a wall mount though and this missing item would have certainly sealed the deal with me as far as giving it five stars
but sadly with its lack of appletalk support horrible lack of mac support and omission of any sort of wall mount im detracting a star
but if youre not afraid to set up ip printing id recommend it highly
if you need something more macfriendly you might want to try macsense or smc
just dont get the apple base station because for the price its just not worth itworked great for many years
stable and good wireless signal
only ran into issues if multiple people tried to stream a movie or music at the same time the bandwidth would just get sucked upi didnt realize before i bought this that even though the switch is  mbps the connection between it and the modem is only 
this is not a big deal since ill never reach that speed anywaywhat is a big deal though and my biggest problem is its high frequency pitch
i cant ignore it its driving me crazyother than that its a good product
i had a netgear before this that i had to reset every few days
this i havent reset since i configured it  weeksinstallation was a piece of cake
i switched out my non wireless linksys router for this baby
i get great signal all through my place albeit it my place is a tad small
i was up and running within  minutes
im using an orinoco gold card courtesy of work and have had no problems since
i just switch between two profiles between home and work
would have gotten five stars if not for the securityencryption flawsi bought this to get cable internet access in my den which was   stories away
this works great
i noticed that a lot of people have had the same problem i did
at first my wireless network would not hold a good signal but then i realized that it was not the router but the linksys card itself
the older version of the card was not very good however the newere  and  versions are much better
but however i do not recommend the linksys go with either the dlink or compaq ones
the only thing that made me not give this a  was the fact after you use it and leave your computer to idle and return like an hour later the internet gets slow
this is something to do with the router and they said it would be fixed in the next firmware upgrade
but all i have to do is restart and  seconds later its up and running
i do recommend this for sharing internet connection but i do not recommend it for networking
get the wireless gateway it is much easier to setup and much more stablei bought a befws in late dec  and a couple of weeks ago the wireless functionality ceased to function
another customer only got  months of use  i guess i was lucky with  months
however a year life span is unacceptable for a piece of networking gear
except for this unfortunate situation i would have rated the router  stars
in fact i liked it so much while it worked that i plan to replace it with the quotnewquot linksys wirelessg router which hopefully will last quite a bit longerwhile my folks have gone through  or  routers this one smc barricade has served me since  with no complaintsit is now starting to stop working every so often so i have to reboot pull the plug and plug it back in  so i am ready to upgradesignal strength has been great  i can get signal from the far corner of my basement without a problem anywhere inside the house and outside as wellsometimes we have to ask ourselves  is the consumer equipment we buy designed to be run  weeks on end
my smc router worked quite well for about  yrs
it was mostly used in wired setting and as a consumer unit it worked fineafter it failed tech support was patient to troubleshoot the problem
after numerous resetting and troubleshooting  my unit was replacedthe lifetime warranty is amazing generous and should be one of the reasons people should seriously consider smc
currently the warranty has been changed for the life of the unit but still its amazing that there are companies out there such as smc that stand behind their products like that
when possible i try to buy smcon practice side  online setup menu very well designed ergonomics of the unit wireless range and power of the signal  all great
network printer port unlike what ive seen in competing router models  my smc built in printer worked like a charm on every pc even one running win smc doesnt produce millions of models as competition  but those it does  are quite good and solidi would have given this  stars except for the fact that the first unit that i received did not work at all
i received the smc router and attempted to set it up but it could not even supply dhcp services to computers that were directly connected so i determined that it was defective
i returned it to amazon and received a replacement in less than  weekthe new unit works great
i have cablemodem internet service and the old setup i had meant that in order to use the internet you would need to be in a pretty secluded room in our house upstairs
while this was useful sometimes it was a real pain for me when i would bring my laptop from work to telecommute which i do once per weekin any case i purchased a linksys usb wireless network adapter not from amazon followed the directions for both the router and the adapter and it works like a charm
i generally work from downstairs with the router upstairs and have had no problems with the connection
i also tried it out from our back yard without any problems
if there is a decrease in performance between my laptop connected over the wireless device and directly connected to the router i cannot tell
i have been able to work efficiently from home using the new wireless setup and am very pleased with itthe process to clone the mac address on our home computer so that the router could support multiple connected machines was very straightforward
i have not yet setup the print server but i will be doing this soon as well
overall once i got the functioning unit the setup took about  minutes and has worked greati recently purchased the wireless barricade and pc card for sharing my cable connection between my desktop and laptop
with the price of earthlink rising to  i found myself wasting money on slow access
amazon had the units on sale with free shipping so i decided to take the plunge
my impressions
the smcawbr is a rather small device only slightly larger than my cable modem and works flawlessly
setup was a breeze i had it up and running in a matter of minutes
the only software needed is for the print server
here is where my only problem occurred
i had a difficult time getting the print server to work with my hp c deskjet
well after upgrading the firmware from smcs website and reloading my hp printer drivers it works greatthe only reason i gave this system  stars rather than  was the need to update firmware for a yr old printer
youd think smc would support hp printers out of the box rightmy wireless pc card also smc worked for about mins then locked up my sharp laptop
i contacted smcs tech support and they confirmed it was defective
they told me to contact amazon for a replacement so i sent them an email
they are shipping me a new pc card nd day air and a postage paid return label for my defective unit
excellent customer service
amazon rulesthis router cant be beat for the price
many wireless access points cost the same but lack the routing features and port switch
the latest firmware is fairly stable
the only drawbacks with this product are mediocre wireless throughput compared to its predecessor the wbr
however it also costs much less
some earlier firmware versions are also rather buggy and cause wireless dropouts or frequent router lockups
i would highly recommend upgrading to the latest firmware if you encounter lockups or wireless dropoutsother than that for the price this wireless router really cant be beatafter researching the dlink linksys and netgear routers via  amazon reviews i chose the smc wireless barricade
my configuration includes a dell pii an ibm piii laptop  printers and a cable modem using roadrunnerwhy smc over the others
smc has more function points eg print server and is as realiable and effective as all the other routers for a better pricei was concerned that setup would take a lot of time and that i would have installationsetup issues  why wouldnt i
 of the reviews mention setup in  minutes flat
so did i have problems
yes
but they were all synchronization issues eg i turned on the router before the cable modem
the tech support team had me up and running in  minutes
i called again for help with the print server  no problem  that was up and running in  minutes
i even installed and am currently using to write this review the wireless pc card in  minutes
the wireless connection is working  stories away from the routerthe only problems with smc are the documentation is sparse and makes assumptions about your configuration
the hold time for tech support cna be greater than  minutesother than that the router smc wireless pc card is a dream
you cannot beat the functions and reliability for this price
although i have read that the dlink and the smc are manufactured by the same company  so if the dlink is cheaper then  that was not the case for me  the smc was cheaperin terms of what it offers for its price this router cannot be beat
mac address control a builtin firewall webbased configuration and many other features make this router easy to set up and get running
as with all wireless products dont expect your range to be too far and go through any more than  or  walls
besides that it has worked very well with pcs and macs
the only problem i had was setting it up to do pppoe for a dsl login but that just took a little bit of extra work
also on really neat feature is its ability to clone the mac address of the computer with which you are setting it up so if your isp does mac control you wont have to call them up and wait on hold forever to get them to allow a new mac address on
just another little feature that makes this an overall great producti replaced my phone line network in my house with this router and wireless cards from smc for the laptops
it took me a few tries to get it all working but finally it worked
it seems to work about as fast as my phoneline network did
it added the convenience of being able to roam around the house but i am limited as to where i can go
i have yet to experiment with moving the router around physically
i need to buy a longer rj cable to do this
however i will be limited there because i want to use the device as a print server also so the parallel cable will limit how much i can move it around to get better range
things would probably work better in the house if i could put the unit more towards the middle of the house instead of where it is now downstairs at the front of the housenevertheless  the unit works well when you even have a poor quality link
the speed is quick
however if the link becomes too poor then you can lose it all together and you have to use the configuration utility to rescan to get the thing to link againanyway i accomplished my objective that both my wife and i can surf the internet on our laptops and the kids can use the internet on the desktop in the study
we are not restricted to plugging into a phone line outlet but we are restricted by the range
not perfect but a good compromise
the new standard a coming out will probably solve the range issue but it will be much more expensive at firstmy final word is that i would recommend the unit but placement of the router is an important variable in the range you will get indoorsi wrote a previous review on the smc barricade below and just wanted to add some more info now that ive tried out the print server partthe print server is a plain old lpr daemon
so any machine with a lpr capability ntwkunix should be able to print to it without any software install
which is good because the print server software that smc provides completely screws up parts of the the printing configuration on my xp machine
not in a harmful way though
just creates these gibberous ports that dont do anything
needless to say the prtmate port does not work in xpanyway you need to configure the tcpip port as standard lpr with the queue name quotlpquot
on ntwkxp you also need to turn on quotbyte countquot or your pages get cut offin the end it works great and im glad the printing wasnt some proprietary setup
no longer does my computer need to be on for my wife to printit does get hot on the bottom but putting on the feet helpedi purchased the mouse to work with my new xp system and didnt have any problems
xp installed it easily and i was in business
so nice to not have that cord 
buy itfirst of all this is not a new product
for some people like me who have been dealing with computers for  years but still the first time to use a cordless mouse the experience is wonderful
without that stupid wire everything seems to be so coolpros wireless the name says it all freedom is priceless optical never have to clean that ball again very precise and can be easily setup for internet browsing and gamingcons this is an old model
the setup files came within the cdr cannot run under my windows xp system
but who cares
my xp can recognize this mouse and make full use of it and thats enough battery eater
its so hungry for batteries that you should start thinking about rechargable batteries and chargers
or if you have a lot money to spend buy yourself a mx model its rechargable like a shaver
just try to imagine the feeling of holding a shaver in your hand when you are browsing internet the mouse get lost from time to timewell its cordless and now it can be cluelessside by side i have both at my desk right now this mouse is hands down better than the wireless intellimouse explorer
however it does lose its mind once in awhile and jump across the screen
 month is about all you can expect the batteries to last
bighanded people will find this thing a little small
the slope of the mouse puts your wrist and forearm at a funky anglehowever compared to the ms mouseit  is not nearly as heavy is better balanced  slides easierwhich makes delicate pointing tasks easier  exhbits far less hysterisis  wakes up fasterone thing you will notice with almost all of the optical mice is their tendency to sleep on you as soon as you stop moving them
that fraction of a second that it takes them to wake up is enough to cause a quotjumpquot
i have yet to find a wireless optical mouse that does well for finepositioning work found in graphic design tasksi have owned this for  weeks
i use it on a mac g running os positives optical tracking works very well over most surfaces
will never use a mechanical mouse again
wireless works well
have my receiver under my desk on top of tower
weight is good
overly light mice are difficult to use for photo editingsuggestions software functionality is basic
low battery function didnt work
substituted a shareware driver usb overdrive which provides many more options eg independently programmable tracking speed and acceleration acceleration option for the wheel etc
negativeswith daily use on a silver grey mousepad the batteries lasted  weeks
latest software driver has problems
increases time for disk to disk and application to application copy operations by a factor of three
this is significant when doing backups
resolved the issue by using usb overdrive driver mentioned above
does not track well on patterned surfaces eg wood grained desk top side button is too low and fairly uselessit can be used with both the left and right handsi am somewhat ambidextrous and have no trouble using this mousewith either one actually im a righty but for some reason i prefer using a mouse with my left handi can now move the mouse to my right where there is another desk and scroll amp click while im checking a document or notesand then move back again to my lefti cant believe how wonderful an untethered mouse can feeldecent i doubt it could hold   but it worksi have this bag and just ordered another
it is really made well
the zipper is steel and i have no trouble opening and closing my year old bag and the handle is excellent
the pages are securely attached and i dont worry about them falling out when i carry the bag around even if it isnt zipped closed or opening it on my lap
it opens easily and completely even completely full
there is plenty of room to flip through all the pages to look through the book
there is even room in the very back of the bag to hold a couple of my cds that i need to keep in the jewl case
i do have a bag by mainstays that i like better but they dont hold this many discs and the bags are hard to find anymore
the only things i dont like about this bag are the pockets that hold the cds or dvds are real tight so you have to slide the cd on the rough service in and out
im always concerned im going to scratch the disc
the mainstays sleeves are larger with a flat that goes over the top of the cd to keep them from ever falling out so you dont have to slide the disc against the back service to get it in and out
also the matterial that divides the cds front to back seem rough to me instead of soft and protective though ive never damaged a cd yet but i worry about sliding my cds in and out too often
i think its a good buy and the bag is so well made that it makes up for the draw backsthis is fine for what it is but i was surprised at the size given that i had other  disk wallets and was used to a certain profile
i found it to be a lot larger in all dimensions than i expected or wantedthe fact tha
