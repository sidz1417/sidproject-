this thing worked for  days after i bought itstone age and not worth the moneyi purchased this item at the end of april   everything was fine
i used it only a few times then it sat for a few months untouched
then in november  when i went to use it again there was absolutely no display
swapping out batteries made no difference
i went to the memorex website they dont even list it
i dont have a clue as to why the display went out
it plays but without a display its next to useless
of course now that more than  days have elapsed im stuck with it
 wasted
dont buy this itemsometimes it doesnt work
ive had mine for a year now and i have checked for updated driversi use mine with windows xp professional
ive used it to read smart media cards and compact flash cards and in both instances i often get screen freezes when trying to access the cards
then i have to rebootsometimes i have to reboot three or four times before the thing works right
whats up
i dunno
im not a newbie
ive tried a variety of fixes including reinstalling the driver unplugging the usb cable and trying a different slot and standing on my head when inserting the cards
this device is not reliablewhen it does work after two or three reboots it works just finetry a different brandthis router seemed to have everything for very little money
well if it is too good to be true it probably isthe setup was nice and smooth
however everything past that had problemsfirst it kept dropping my wireless connections
i called support and they told me to restart it
it kept doing it
i called back and waited on hold for them to tell me to change a bunch of funky settings mtu channel etc
why should that be necessary for basic operation
well i did it and it helpednext i found that it was intermittently dropping packets maybe  of the time
after waiting on hold for  minutes they told me to install new firmware
it kept happening
after another  minutes on hold they told me theyd escalate my call
i was disconnectedi call back
after  hour on hold for a level  tech person i talk to somebody who says he doesnt know and hell transfer me to a level  tech
agg
im still on hold at this moment after another  minutes on hold
so far ive spent over  hours just trying to get it to work reliablyive used the netgear in the past
it is solid
linksys routers also tend to be more reliable than this
i work for an internet provider
weve tested a few of these things
i strongly suggest anybody go with either of those even if they cost a little more than the dlinki use it with a dwl pc card adapter in my laptop
inital setup went so so
the laptop could connect to the internet but not see only the networked computers but not there content
spent tooo many hours trying to get it to work
then the pcmcia card would not be seen by win k and want to be reinstalled and failed
after five months the dhcp server died
so i will not be purchasing dlink in the futurei bought this router to use with my dynamic pppoe dsl connection
the setup and interface were easy enough to use but no matter how i configured it it would not connect to my dsl connection
the router would get pdat messages and disconnect immediately
i found out that other people have had this same problem with this routeralso i couldnt get the router to update its firmware
it would repeatedly give me a message saying that the firmware version is incompatible and i am giving the manufacturer time to produce firmware that solves my problems
otherwise i return it
why
an b wifi compliant device must be able to work with other compliant devices regardless of brand
this one doesnt in my experience
a router should not reset itself randomlyfor one i have already upgraded the firmware twice  to f f to  and it is still flaky
two i have been unable to get a cisco aironet  pcmcia card to associate one that works on other networks
three a compaq wl pcmcia card will associate but it has obtained an ip address only once in over  associations
four the router appears to reset itself irregardless of configuration this means that even my wired pc connections lose access to the wan
this latter has nothing to do with my ability to configure the unitalthough this router had a lot of nice configuration features i was disappointed to find that it fails miserably when it comes to performing some of the more basic essential router tasksthe di requires a reset every couple of days because it flakes out and drop routing functionality through the wan for all of my computers inside my local network with statically assigned ips you must assign static ips to your machines if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the router this is a horrible flaw that makes the router useless for any serious useanother big problem is that it has a very weak routing implementation  if you keep tcpip connections open for more than  minutes without constant activity kiss your connection goodbye
ie
dont expect to be able to use telnet ssh or ftp programs without your connection being dropped every time you leave your connection idle for more than  minutes this problem didnt happen with my old linksys routeri emailed tech support on this one over  times  they just kept sending me back a cutandpaste of the entire user manual  theyre completely uselessbottom line is  dont buy this router
get a different brand router or a string and two paper cups because communicating across the web with this router is so unreliable  its worthlesseven with their most recent firmware release my problems are still presenti have  pcs with their airplus pci nics and a laptop with a thirdparty wireless nic
my top of the line toshiba laptop w integrated wireless nic constantly experiences network outages
the signal strength and quality is excellent yet the network drops at least once a minute and then reconnects shortly thereafter
i even went as far as to reinstall the osthe pcs with the airplus nics seem to be working great thoughthey seemed to have fixed the bandwidth problem and i am finally getting some decent download speedsif you plan on using a thirdparty nic do not buy this routerthis item should never have been released with the major problems that it hashad
too many people have had issues with this routerwhen i contacted tech support last time which was useless and i told them i was using their feature to not broadcast the ssid the gentleman asked quotwhyquot
i told him because its a great security feature and i want to use it
he said you dont need that and basically told me not to use it not explaining why when i asked him
i went as far to tell him you provide a feature and you dont even support it
this feature does not worki will personally never buy another dlink product
i dont even want to sell this item on ebay because i dont want to stick someone else with this inferior producti bought this router and is dropping vpn connection this is very annoying
when i called dlink the support calls goes to some third party not direct dlink i have to hold for more than  hrs to get coonected
the support guys does not have more than the configguide knowledge
they refered the call to dlink special tech support
never heard back from them
returned the router to store
no optioni used to be such a big dlink fan but they quickly lost a loyal customer in the last  months
the di is so weak
i keep getting packet loss on the wired lan side windows xp would complain for a brief moment that the network connection is offline and of course the matching led on the router would go off too
wireless part is even worse
packet loss random reboot loop you name it it does this is my last dlink producti bought this  with a d link airplus  also supports  mbps
upon installing the software and rebooting the card came up ok for the first few time
then it was not recognized by the computer and wanted to reinstall the drivers
plus the card did not let me connect to other computers on the network to transfer files
the card has been intermittent and pain
very bad product or just this set of router and pc card
do not recomend this line of products
the hub dhcp server died in less than six months
several techs tried to install and setup and on several dell laptops
tried a linksys usb card and it work great
so think again about purchasing this producti used this card for one year in the library of my university  and i always had problems obtaining a stable connection
i thought it was because of the signal
then i used other friends laptop there  one with a netgear card one ibm t with builtin wireless geez they all worked so well
so the conclusion is this dlink just sucks
i am dumping mine and getting a new onedont buy dlink
neveri noticed no difference with this card as oppose to linksys or netgear mbps wireless cardwarning dwl may corrupt firmware on hp laptops
the dwl software would not install on my target hp omnibook so i tried it on my newest hp omnibook which already had builtin wireless
performance review the dwl worked irratically
after i uninstalled the dlink software my laptops internal wireless was no longer functioned
i am a swhw engineer and after  hours of work and calls to dlink support i believe that the laptops original wireless firmware has been corrupted beyond repair  a sickning price to pay
for me nightime dlink support was helpful daytime support struck me as ignorant and rude
their email response to my request for escallation dear valued customer  agent response contact manufacture of computer  sincerely andremy monitor have some extra usb connections and it uses a male a to male b cable for it since i moved the monitor far away from the case i figured this cable will do the trick better than it will to get a usb extension
well it didnt work every time i connect a usb device to my monitor it detects that something is being plugged but never recognizes the device
i ended up getting that usb extension and it works perfectly now im wishing i didnt waste my moneythe cable looks good but did not work
the cable got extremely hot and did not even recognize my devices
i switched the cable with another brand and everything workedbe careful when usingi have been a canon fan for years but a friend recommended the  after only a few hundred pictures the flash stopped working and my friend said that he now has the same problem
i contacted niknon and they said the problem was not covered under warrenty and i payed  for the repair
hope it works for a while
i have now purchased a canon d slr and love the canon
do not buy the 
wes avengwavenmindspringcomplease dont buy this camera
this camera has the worst auto focus you can imagine
i have used canon eos for over a decade
maybe that is why i believe this camera is substandard
for indoor pictures it takes a few seconds after you press the shutter to take the picture
try to get a good picture of a young child with a camera like that
even my mp kodak takes better photos indoors than this oneyou a taking a big chance with the terk tv discontinued by the mfg
especially if you need the ability to switch between the antenna and cable or other video input andor you are not in a very strong reception area
the antennavideo switch failed completely in  days
the unit no longer has any continuity to the coax input no matter what you do
it can still be used as an antenna with the gain turned on and all the way up
that is if you can place it in the right spot and point it the right direction
for a unit that is supposed to free you from those constraints it fails miserably and produces all sorts of interference and snow if the location and direction are not perfecti bought this antenna base on all the good reviews ive read
big mistake
i couldnt get any clear channels from this thing
my unpowered rabbit ear outperformed it by a mile
and the size
it has the wing span of an albatross
total waste of moneyi live  miles out of town in the mountains where reception is poor  but with our regular old aerial antenna we have acceptable image and fine sound and  channels blurry images on  other channels
this terk tv doesnt work nearly as well
the two best channels are just white static unless you turn up the amlification to full then theres just the ghost of an images buried in the static
the other channels just arent even there
i used my grandmothers yearold loop antenna at the same house and it gets much better results
im returning the tvi purchased a panasonic dvdrp progressive scan dvd player for my hdtv setup
it was the most expensive of the others being displayed so i figured it was probably the most functional had more features
i found this to be wrongit is obsolete before it was marketedit does not play any of the rewritable dvd formats like dvdrw and dvdrw
since dvd writers are popping up everywhere and many of my friends already have dvd writers on their pcs its hard to imagine an expensive dvd player not playing rewritable discsi found a sony model that for the same price does play the dvd rewritablesso once again price does not mean the same as featuresmake sure your progressive scan dvd player play a variety of computer writable media type before you buy itgot this refurbished from costco
good screen etc
but the power runs out every time you turn your back on it and there is no backup watchtype battery
when the power runs out you lose every program you ever installed and the software walks you through an insultingly stupid nanotutorial before you can use it again
stupid design of the decade
bought a stowaway keyboard for it and whenever the keyboard got near it the ipaq got flaky
tonight the thing died again and i destroyed it dead it makes a better work of art than it ever did a pda
reason  i had to spend more time and effort reviving it than using it
a great concept with severely crappy reliabilitywe purchased for traveling between our summer and winter homes twice a year
firstly we found that it had no range on the interstate
wanted to get road reports and couldnt reach anyone further than a  mile awaytoo late
secondly it doesnt work anymore
it appears to have short or something
it has never been dropped or misused
it was working in the car one day and the next it would not
very disappointedi ordered this radio for my travels between my home in canada and my home in the states
when i received the radio i tried it out and seemed to work ok although it didnt have much more than a mile distance
when i was ready to travel back to canada about  months after receiving it i tried using it and it just did not workperiodi contacted cobra via email and their response was ship it to us and we will repair it for   shipping
the warranty had expired but it hadnt really even been use other than to test iti was totally upset with their response and have never been able to use it since
i had a cobra in the late s to early s and it worked great so i am totally annoyed that they wouldnt look after this problem for me and will definitely not buy a cobra product again
stay clear of this onei just started dating a woman who owns this system and she was so proud of it that i simply didnt have the heart to tell her the truth
on our third date she took me back to her apartment where we watched a dvd beautiful plasma tv horrendous bose hunkajunk
the only reason i kept my mouth shut was because shes incredibly hot and i wanted to be there for breakfast the next morningbut it took a lot of drinks for me to sit through this audio nightmare male voices often came out of the socalled bass module instead of the tiny and tinny little satellites and those voices were mixed in with the smeared flabby midbass coming out of the boxtotally localizable midbass
the music we watched amadeus was completely hollowsounding like listening to a boombox
during a few musical peaks there was even audible resonance coming out of the pseudosubno surprise since its just a cheap plastic enclosure not even mdf like you get with even the cheapest real subwoofersmama mia the things a guy will do just to get some playfor four hundred bucks these days you could actually get a pair of real bookshelf speakers infinity beta s polk monitor s hsu hbs and a cheap sub dayton sub from partsexpress dot com that would effortlessly destroy this bose junk
granted it wont be in such a tiny and daintylooking package but it will sound a million times betteri think ill have to break the news to her on our tenth date or so it actually makes me feel dirty not to hehplantronics should be ashamed of themselves selling this for 
it is not even worth 
you can clearly hear a lot of static and hissing sound in speakers and headphone mode
the wires are extremely cheap thin and fragile
you can clearly see it from the pictures
they are not copper
it is some kind of cheap metal that deteriorates over time
mine is  years old and i assure you that there are deteriorations on all ends
because of the audio issue i never continued using it
plantronics dont seem to have many well built products i had a pair of plantronics headphone that slowly broke off over time too
if you have good speakers and headphone this switch will make it sound like analog radio
im warning you people dont buy it
there are much better alternatives out there
also the base is not weighted so it doesnt stay put if you have thick wires
that clear piece of plastic under the switch is not a light indicator dont be fooled
the design makes no sense except marketing gimmick
but the main problem is really the static and hissing sound cause by the cheap built quality that reason alone should be enough for anyone to stay away from iti got this because i wanted to be able to switch between my computer speakers and my headphones
id listen to things through my speakers when no one is around and through the headphones when people are near by so i would not disturb them
this device was a little on the expensive side considering what it does but its a plantronics device so i expected a quality device
sadly the device lets sound through on both outputs reguardless of what is selected
the sound for the nonselected speakers or headphone side does come out several db lower then the selected side but i wanted something that would fully switch between headphone or speakers and not allow any sound to come out of the other device i am not using at that moment
when i use this to listen via headphones i still have to switch the power off to my speakers to not disturb anyonemy order was cancelled after i was told it was shipped
i received a full refund but i needed the switch not the money
i am still looking for another providerhowever this is a great product i use one at my officei read the reviews on amazon website before i bought this item for my am radio
i bought the item as new
however when i received the item it was a used item
the original plastic bag was torn open and the box was obviously has many signs of being used
besides when i tried to use the antenna it did not work
it did not show any signal of signal improvement at all
just to be fair this item was used when i received it
not sure this item is broken or just not working
i returned the item and in the process of getting my refund
would not recommend purchase of this itemtry as i may  and i have really really tried  the terk indoor am antenna advantage does nothing for my am reception
my clock radio does not have a receptor for the wire attachment so i have tried the antenna beside the radio atop the radio behind the radio  turned every which way  dialed every which way  i did not try it standing on my head
i have to face it  this gizmo just does not work for mefor receiving am radio this is actually worse than the small cheap antenna that was incuded with my new stereo receiver
dont waste your money go to the nearest hardware storeand buy a cheap long length of wirealso is totally unusable if your stereo receiver scans for signals the terk am advantage is already so poor an antenna it will never find signals in the first placemy relatively cheap stereo came with an am radio antenae that plugged into the back
the terk am antenna has two wires not a plug
the instructions indicated by placing the antenna near my stereo i would get a benefit
no such luck
i do not know if it would have worked better had i been able to plug it in
i returned it but the postage to me and to return it was more than half the cost of the antennai bought this trek antenna with the sangen wr radio
matter a fact it came yesterday morning
i setup the radio and antenna
the antenna did nothing to improve my reception
i am not in a fringe area but i have a small mountain range between me and  of the radio stations i listen too
i have another that is  miles away from me
none of the stations improved
so this morning i am returning the trek antenna and getting a refundi am not saying this is a bad product it just did not work for mejamesi got this to go with my bose wave radio to get better reception on a station only  miles away
it didnt do a very good job
in fact the bose worked just as well without itthis product did not work any better with the digital converter box than the rabbit ears that came with the old analog tv setthe antenna lead was way to short for the antenna to work
not enough money involved to return the itemso i threw it in the trasheven with the transmitter and receiver less than  apart it didnt worki tried it with the receivers builtin ir with the ir cable that was provided and even with a more expensive cable that comes with the slingboxpurchased three pair of this productinstalled in home that is less than  square feetall worked initially and intermittentlyall failed after a couple months of usecomplete garbagei was very hopeful that the negative reviews i read about this product were due to operator error but unfortunately they were not
although i could get them to work they were very intermittent and touchyi called the company that makes them and they did warn me that you have to keep them away from metal objects sunlight or florescent lights
that could have been part of my problem since i located it next to a recliner on an end table near a lamp with an energy saving florescent bulb
unfortunately since it had to be plugged into an electrical outlet it was the only place i could locate iti returned this item and purchased the oneforall urc rfir remote for not much more
i put the rf unit in the exact same place that i had the leap frog unit and it works xs better
no more worrying about pointing the remote directly at the rf unitone thing about the urc combo is that the rf unit only works with the remote that comes with it
not really a negative since it has learning capability and i was able to replace the  original remotes that i had been usingi have used these beforebut this version didnt work wella very short distance being used and it worked for a day and then could never get it to talk againi would try another brangi had a recoton dscira and it didnt work but maybe  of the time so i thought id buy this one
unfortunately it only worked  of the time about ft away passing through  wall
setup was easy but it would take numerous keypresses of the remote for anything to pick up
for example even slowly pressing channel  on the remote it might pick up    or nothing at all
ive tried moving both the transmitter and receiver to different locations but that didnt help only sometimes it would just completely not work at all
i doubt its my satellite receiver or remote being incompatible because the picture of the remote on the box is exactly the same as the dishnetwork remote im using
perhaps it is something with my house all my pcs have wireless keyboards and mice maybe theyre on the same frequency
i have both mhz and ghz cordless phones and an g wireless network
not to mention i live near a cellular tower
perhaps all this stray rf is confusing it since ive tried  different remote extenders and neither works
at any rate im very disappointed and this is going backi have an older terk leapfrog at one house and wanted to install something similar at our vacation home
the older model doesnt appear to be available anymore so i figured this product would work as well since its made by the same company if not better since its newer
i figured wrong
the old leapfrog works immediately and everytime the emitter doesnt even need to point at the product its controlling just being in the same enclosed cabinet is enough
on this newer product i cant seem to get it to work reliably unless i hold the remote  from the receiver
oddly enough after continuing to bombard the receiver with ir radiation from the remote it sort of wakes up and starts working until you dont use the remote for a while and then its back to square one
the vacation home is in a remote area and the only other wireless devices in the house are a ghz cordless phone and a g router on another floor in the opposite corner of the house
i have the same wireless devices at the older leapfrog home and the same g router sits next to it
the receiver and emitter in the newer leapfrog home are about  linear feet from each other
im baffled that terk could take a simple product that worked great  years ago and through the marvel of engineering incompetence make it worsebad
bad
badwhat can i say this thing did not work
i got maybe  or  signals to actually reached and functioned my component inside my cabinetthe design is like something a child would design for a grade science projectand it would earn an honorable mention ribbon at best
thin plastic casing
light weightthe satellite receivers short cable easily moves the transmitter out of position when you are trying to position the dumb things
and who uses a metal external antennae any morethis is  right
enough saidnever said this before about a product do not buy this thingpeople should be warned
terrible product
terk should be ashamed
the signal relay is very unreliable even when the units are right next to each other and youre holding the remote  feet away from the transmitter
just awfuli bought mine to control devices that are in a cabinet behind closed doors
right now i have a tivo and a sony bluray player
the sony will not work unless im standing  in front of the terk unit
the tivo works kind of
i have to aim it just right to get it to work
unacceptable
i have the ir extender cable in use with the sensors on top of the devices on the back side of the cabinet door
ive moved them around about  times looking for the sweet spots no luck
cant blame the remotes either as i first had these results with the oem remotes
thinking they might be weak i bought a harmony one universal remote
no difference  same results
if i open the cabinet door the remotes all work perfectly across the room from in the kitchenif youre trying to control devices behind closed doors in a cabinet skip this productcomplete junk
you have to hold the remote about  inches away for it to work
dont waste your time on thisgood reviews here were for the previous design
new model no goodagain and againthe old version was great different design same model numberthis new version rectangular dead on arrival doaagaini tried it when the new version first came out and it was deaddesperately tried the new version again and again doawhat is wrong with terk
are they unaware of thisis amazon unawarewhy do they keep manufacturing and selling defective unitsmost of the time it works great
but once in a while this thing gets scary
i used it for my cable box and one day it started changing the channels on my cable box by itself
i had to keep switching the channel back to where i wanted it but then a few seconds later it would change the channel again
seriously this thing is scary
stay away
what a waste of you might notice that the newer reviews are harsher than the older ones
i just purchased this from circuit city and it does not work
i tried a variety of rooms remotes and configurations and only time it worked was then the remote was less than  inches from the sender unitas a side notei have tried to write this review on ccs website and i keep getting an error messageyet the ratings on ccs website are very high shadydont bother with this one
ive had to input all my info twice after having it all erased
the battery indicator showed i still had a third of my power left in my battery both times and after the battery power is gone it erased all the addresses and appointments i had input
the readability and resolution is good but whats the point if you cant access the data
dont get a pda that uses batteriesthis is a old school gadget that no longer works well in modern age
it did not work as it should
the co and amazon both were nice about it and took it back
did not work for me
if you get it make sure its worth it
you may want something more current or a better cell phone with the same optionsi owned a perfectly wonderful pioneer  disc cd changer
since my cd collection had approached the  mark i decided to purchase the sony cdpcx unit so that i could randomly listen to my entire collection without constantly changing cds
after reading some of the reviews on amazon i was reluctant to purchase this unit
unable to find another unit that would accomodate  cds i decided to take a chance and went ahead with the purchase
big mistake
after spending hours loading the cds into the system and setting it to play on randomshuffle i soon discovered that several of my cds were skipping
i am meticulous with the handling of my cds so i know that the problem was not caused by my mishandling of them
i removed the cds that were skipping hoping that this was an isolated incident
the next day i turned on the unit and again set it to play songs randomly
once again some of the cds started skipping
when i removed them from the unit i noticed that there were scratches on both cds
i then called up sony to explain to them that this particular cd changer has an engineering defect and that it scratches cds
their response was that they have had no reports of such incidences
i asked to speak with a supervisor who informed me that this cd changer has been taken off the market and is not being replaced with a similar unit
he said that stores still had them in stock but once the stock was exhausted there would be no more available
i then asked him why they were not replacing this unit with another  cd changer model and was told that they are getting out of the cd changer business in favor of dvdcd combo units
i offered the comment that the reason they are not replacing the cdpcx with a similar unit is because they know that the cdpcx has an engineering defect and they are not capable of building a  cd unit that is problem free
at any rate i called the store where i purchased my changer from and told them that i was returning it because it was scratching my cds
i then started the long process of removing the cds from the system and was astounded to find that almost  out of every  cds had been scratched by this cd changer
i called back sony and their attitude was basically that they couldnt care less
once you buy a sony product you are on your own
their customer support is non existent
despite the fact that over  of my cds have been damaged by this unit their response was that they were sorry but there is nothing they could do about it
based on this incident i will never purchase another sony product again
if you are planning to purchase this cd player my advice to you quotbuyer bewarequotthe design of and features on this remote are quite nice
but it does not seem to work with hard drive recording systems
i also cant get it to work with our sony received
there is a support number but the hours are    monday  friday
so those of us who have to work cant easily call for help
i sent an email to their support but have not received any reply yet
its been three weeksi dont know if a fool would buy a product from a company that has no support
i tried  for  daysinoperative
i sent emails through the oneall websiteno response
i was shunted among several audiovox corporate phone queues minutes worth of your call is very important to us
i dont know if a fool would buy a product from a company that does not support its productswarning if your tv or home theater is not in the list it cant learn all the keys because this equipment have memory only for a bunch of sequenceone for all a very disgusting experiencei bought this urc  remote control becuase my old remote a one for all cinema  was never able to operate my sony strkp stereo receiver and would not operate my new toshiba dvrsu dvd recordervcr it did work with my old philipsmagnavox dvd player
of the three items which i needed the urc  to control the two mentioned above and a toshiba af tv the remote was only able to operate the tvi tried every code listed in the manual for the other two devices and not one of the codes worked
i then tried the remotes code search ability without any luck
finally i called customer service to get the unit upgraded over the phone
it took five days just to get through to customer service due to a higher volume of customer service calls than usual and once i was able to actually talk to someone the unit could not be upgraded over the phone
two different customer service reps tried the upgrade process  or  times each it failed every timefinally the second rep told me that the upgrade process very often will not work over a cordless phone and that it never works over a digital phone system a phone system with dsl or a filtered phone line
i have a ghz cordless phone using digital phone service so the upgrade process apparently will not work
she did thoughtfully suggest that i could pump coins into a pay phone for the  minutes or so dont forget that you will pay for the time that you are on hold waiting for someone to answer long distance phone call that each previous upgrade attempt tookso my advice is do not waste your money on this remote control if you have relatively recent equipment which will not respond to any of the built in codes and if you do not have an old fashioned nondigital corded phone with which to upgrade the unit
it may be perfectly fine otherwise but in my case at least it was a complete waste of moneythe cable box im trying to control is in my bedroom
i use an rf converter to feed the signal from that box back into rooms of the house that dont have a cable box
but even from the room right next door the remote wont work reliably
yes there is a closet between the two rooms so the signal has to go through two interior walls with no plumbing or wiring within them
but still this is a distance of less than  feetwhen you add to that the fact that there seems to be no way to control any but the most typical of functions for instance it wont control the dvr part of the cable box its pretty much worthlessthe product has a very limited library and does not support most brands
support on the website gets you no response have sent  queries in the last  months and not one replythe learning feature of the remote is extremely limited it learns only about  buttons before memory is full it is not even enough to program one remote a tv remote has a minimum of  buttons this will learn only  across all devices
the remote works for only about  feet and if the base unit is behind a concrete wall it does not work only works if there is a glass or wooden barrierthe di was working fine for about  weeks then it would no longer get assigned an ip address from the wancable modem
no matter what i did the di would not connect to the outside world
i swapped in an older router i had and my lan was accessing the internet just fine
the di is headed back to amazon for a refundi have had two dlink routers and both have died from overheating
i use my router every day about  hours altogether only doing normal web surfing and minimal to moderate downloading
the first router completely failed had lasted about  years so i thought it had a good run
bought another dlink because hey they are cheap
its been a little over a year and the thing is overheating just like the first one
you can feel the heat just rising off the cheap plastic box
it works intermittenly and will probably fail completely soon
besides spending money twice on something that died so easily i had always had trouble with the advanced features such as opening up ports and even using the dmz feature
i could never get my router to open up correctly to outside traffic
im going to go with a linksys hoping it will last me a little longer and will perform more reliablymy  arrived without the plastic spacer required to hold the cat  cable in the connector
after a few dropped connections i realized the unit was defective star only because you cant opt to choose no starsi bought this thing about a year ago
i wanted a small camera to keep in my every day carry bag and figured this would be cool since it was small and cheapi got it loaded the crummy software took ssome sample pictures hooked it up to the computer and nothing
i have yet to be able to get the picture of this thing
i dont know if its a problem with the software or the camera itself but after several attempts i just put it in the closet and forgot about itthe bag looks good so theres no problem there
the problem is that its too small
somehow when viewing the picture i thought it was larger
in fact the description even says large
dont be fooledit couldnt hold my canon t and one lens
the fit was too tight and i had trouble getting them out of the bag
about the only thing i would put into that bag is a small  point and shoot camera and even then  it would be difficult to add  anything elsethis is a very small bag
if you need something to carry your camera and lens in this is not iti was mislead by the title here
this item is a replacement for the canon cbls
it is not a canon product
it does indeed charge the nbl battery
it does work on an ac or dc power source
the real canon cbls is a neat compact unit about the size of a deck of cards and the ac power prongs fold down out of the way when not in use
it will store quite easily in a camera bag
this item here is about  larger and comes with an ac transformer and power cord and another power cord with a cigarette lighter adapter
just what i needed another product with a transformer and power cords to keep up with
this is listed as the canon cbls but it is not
i will be sending it back because it is not what i wanted nor was it what i was lead to believe i was orderingaddendum today i see that my review is accomapnied by a picture of the real cbls by canon
the price here is about  which is probably the real thing
i paid about  for an equivalent though equivalent was not in the product description
my advice is that you should be sure that you are getting the real canon cbls
if the price is too good you probably are notlocks up everytime i put a memory card in it
not happy at all
i replaced it with a dell jukebox and am very satisfiedinstead look into cfgb lexar x compact flash card
this one is type  and slow as molasses
for about the same price the lexar card which is type  is almost  times faster
if you are into digital photography with atleast mp cameras you need to skip this card and get a faster oneof course as all things computer related as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically
unit works great but buy the  gig
more bang for the the camera works ok  the wrist strap is impossible to put on
i need it since many users need this on the go and it would save the camera from droppingthe wrist strap was so frustrating that we wanted to throw it out the windowthere is also no casecant really recommend it since it gave us so much initial frustrationsi bought a dvd for my son within the last  years and now the unit is displaying error code h
do not buy panasonici bought it put in the batteries and immediately needed a magnifying glass to read the worst lcd display i have ever seen actually could not see in my life
after squinting and fumbling through some programming features i started to feel that i was doing something wrong
i realized that i could select all devices to program except the tv
you simply cannot program the tv
you can program a digital cable box a vcr  etc
but the device acts like it will let you select the tv but it does not
sony cost me hours of shopping and a couple of frustrating hours to find that they shipped a broken product
this will make me think twice about other sony products quality in the futurei got this viking reader after reading all the negative reviews here
i work on the computer industry and usually do not have problems with installing new devices like these
so even after i read the negative reviews i figured i could make this work with the right driversboy i was wrong
i first installed the drivers which came on the cd
windows  recognized all the  drives and showed them in windows explorer
now when i inserted by compact flash card it did not recognize the media and kept asking me to insert the disk in the drivei tried rebooting multiple times installing and uninstalling the drivers
no luck
i even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review
that didnt work eitherafter  days of meddling i gave up and shipped it back to amazonnote  this drive also looks unusually big for a card reader
the photo is not representative of its actual sizeas a networking quotinternalsquot guy i was shocked to find that this product is fundamentally broken at the network layerwhat people are complaining about here is that the device suddenly stops working and must be unplugged and plugged back in againthis is because the device is trying to be too smart and is losing track of which powerline modules connect to which computers
unfortunately in doing so it prevents the networklevel broadcast facilities from working
the broadcast facility im talking about most arp the address resolution protocol would have automatically corrected the problem if the linksys box wasnt so brokenin essence for all you tech guys and gals is that a learning bridge should never quotlearnquot the broadcast addressif you have only pcs and you load the linksys driver they do some magic to keep the devices from falling over dead  but if you mix in a nonpc linux unix macintosh using a hub off the end of your powerline device youre guaranteed to be frustratedthe symptoms are that some of the network works whatever was working before the bridge tables got corrupted and others stop working with no explanation
the box quotselectivelyquot forwards traffic and becomes deaf to other trafficits like being at a cocktail party and having every third person not be able to hear you and saying quotover herequot as arp does doesnt help eitherugh
in my experience this is somewhat typical of linksys products  if you have a windows pc youre fine
if you have anything else they wont talk to youi switched to the siemens powerline module and it has been working just fine for mei purchased this and the usb plusb to set up a home powerline network
plain and simply it sucked
everything else i have is linksys router wireless b and wireless bg
i had no problem working the listed items together and wanted to add powerline
the powerline items couldnt see each other and the setup instructions didnt tell you what components you needed to make the system work
i bought the netgear powerline products
they arrived and worked fine with full instructions
id go netgear in this casethe cameraend connector on this cable does not fit any of our cameras kodak cx etc
it is rectangular not the trapezoidal shape needed by our cameras
the merchant was very nice however and immediately offered a full refundi installed this on my mac duel g tower
it worked randomly for about  weeksbought onereturned  unacceptable many missed keystrokesbought a second onereturned  unacceptable top row of keyboard goes dead intermittentlytried a third one in a bricksandmortar storedid not buy  unacceptable many missed keystrokesthe weird thing is i bought one about three years ago and it was great
i used it until i wore it out
i could touch type at top speed with it
but i guess there is no suitable replacement  ive had to go to a hard plastic keyboard instead
my point here is that its not like i need to learn how to use the device or there is a hardware incompatibility
the old one worked
three new ones failedoh
yeah
the mfr bitterly reports that compusa ripped off his idea and built their own
maybe they did a better job the idea of this keyboard is great
the execution is poor
i bought mine to carry in my carry on baggage on business trips
i have not done anything to it that would have damaged a cheap usb desktop keyboard and yet this thing just stopped working
i probably got  uses out of it
maybe it is great for leaving on the kitchen counter but typing on it was never comfortable and it is far from indestructiblehad this keyboard connected to my computer for only  minutes
keys did not register when pressed or had to be pressed several times very hard
i may have just got a lemon but i am not buying another adesso keyboardkeys started failing after about  months and some of the key markings rubbed off too
not recommendedi bought  of these within a few months of each other because i love this keyboard because of the small size
its set up great
one of the best keyboards in the world
the problem is that the lettersnumbers on the keys come off in  months making the keyboard worthless extremely quickly and then you have to go out and buy new ones
i dont use the keyboards much so the letters and numbers on the keys should not wearoff so quickly but its a big flaw of this keyboard because its happening with the  that i owni know it was my fault for not reading the product description carefully enough but i completely missed the ps in the description and purchased it
and since i havent had a computer with a ps connection since days gone by i had to return it
what was most disappointing was that even though the box suggested that the manufacturer also carried the same keyboard with a usb connection i was unable to find it anywhere online
it went back and i had to go back to my search for the perfect minikeyboard
  finally bought the microsoft arc and itll do the trick but i really preferred the size and shape of the returned keyboard in several ways
if anyone knows of where i can purchase the same keyboard with a usb connection please let me know
thanksi bought this switch box to connect two computers to one monitor  what else would you want it for
seems pretty basic
however both computers seem unable to detect the resolution of the monitors when connected through the switch box and they revert to an inappropriate configuration
i expected the box to just be a passthrough
i dont know what else is going on but since it doesnt deliver on its basic purpose im giving it a poor one starif you want a switch then dont buy this because it product terrible output picturestons of shaking
what is the point if a switch does not product the same picture to start with
it creates a problem by solving one
i hate product like thisrugged totally manualthe b side has stopped workingwasnt used that much
took a whileto troubleshoot since i did notsuspect the switch would faili purchased this switchbox so that i could toggle between at  computer monitor and a  flat screen tv without changing the cable on the back of the computer each time
i installed the cables turned the switch and heard an audible click
when i turned the switch back there was no sound but around  seconds later there was a very faint click
as i toggled back and forth between the displays using the switchbox only the monitor hooked to the setting that had the audible click would display correctly
so back it went
in summary not a good product
tried to give no stars but i guess you cantweve used at least fifty of the previous item with this model number
they worki ordered one of these since i needed another
it never worked
tried on linux windows  windows xp
i think that we got winxp to notice it
however it never was more than an entry in the usb tablein short defectivenow i read a lot of reviews on amazon that say the same thing
does this mean that there is terrible quality control since the basic item works so well or does it mean that amazon keeps sending out the same defective one that gets returnedmaybe one of us should mark the defective one when we send it back to amazon
then the next guy who gets it would be able to tell that he was just sent an item someone else determined was bad
just a thoughtof course it could be the manufacturer just has bad quality control
maybe they should step up
of course if you go to dlinks website good luck finding this item
they really dont want to be selling thesei use a google pixel runs chrome os which only has usb ports
unfortunately this unit doesnt work although the chromebook will support any driver less adapter but this one just doesnt cut itas others have mentioned  either dlink changed the product without changing the model breaking compatibility in the process or these have a high defect rate
tried it with ubuntu  mac osx  and pfsense  all of which other earlier reviews mention working out of the box
i can only conclude that the device is defective or something changed with newer units
either way its going back to amazon to sort out
off to find a different one that worksto preface this review i am probably not the typical usb hub user
if you are a computerbased musician i would urge you to run as fast and as far as you can from this hub
this hub will not allow my logic pro dongle xskey and novation remote sl to function simultaneously
my mac will not recognize the dongle and the sl is spotty
this combo worked and still works flawlessly on a belkin hub
i really needed a  port hub but this was not the solution
dlinks customer service was terrible blaming my hardware for being out of spec instead of admitting that their hardware was to blame
if anyone can recommend a decent port hub for music im all earsthis is a device you either love or hate
you love it if you plug it in and everything works fine
you hate it if your devices wont work with itim in the latter category
i decided to replace my old port hub with this port device even though i havent yet added more usb devices
i had my printer scanner card reader and pda cradle plugged into my old hub and everything was working smoothly
i succumbed to the temptation of getting a highspeed hub since my newer devices are highspeed and i got tired of the this device can perform faster message from windowsi installed this hub and the printer and scanner both registered and installed perfectly
i plugged in my card reader and the computer wouldnt recognize it
i unplugged it and reinstalled the software
still couldnt get it to recognize it
i plugged it directly into my computer and it ran finesame thing happened with my mobile deviceafter working for several hours to get everything to work including reinstalling the software i set everything up on my old hub and again everything ran fineive been working with computers since the old cpm days including dos
and im not such a rookie that i cant plug in a new usb hub
im returning this unit for a refunda few other frustrating things i encountered the hard plastic packaging was extremely hard to get into
i ended up practically tearing it to shreds there is minimal documentation
an insert says to refer to the owners manual on the enclosed cd  but there is no cd the quick installation guide says nothing about needing to reinstall device software
only when you go on the dlink support website do you read this information as others have noted if you are using even a single usb  device there is a chance that all devices connected to the hub even high speed ones will work at usb  speed
so much for backwards compatiblewhen connecting my logitech quikcam  and my logitech usb mouse through this hub trouble is aheadafter starting a camera application eg
yahoo messenger the mouse starts acting erratic and after a few seconds freezes completely
disabling the camera application does not unfreeze the mousei checked with dlink and they have no similar complaints on file so i am returning this item to amazoncom for a refund
and go with the advise of getting another hubthis little hub works great
i do mean little
it fits almost anywhere so you do not have to give up a footprint on a desk
mine hides behind the printeri did not have to use the acdc plugi have the probox and seagate freeagent tb usb  together on it and they work like a charm
no conflictsusb  cord provided is short but depending on your setup that might not be a problem in my case the hub acts like an extension cordupdate  when i ordered a second unit to add to the first it did not work for cascading
i returned that unit and ordered a third unit
now that unit does not work either
so from  stars to  stardlink customer service desperately needs some help
the site is a circle of automated customer service without any provision for email contact
using the internet i found the customer service email and they were less than helpfulon the other hand amazon customer service was exceptionally helpful and worked with me and came up with a plan that should solve the problem with a minimum of hassle
thank you amazoni became so frustrated with this thing losing connection and the constant beeping of my computer i threw it away
get the cyberpower  port that one has never failedcyberpower cphp usb hub port usb  mbps  compatible pcmac plugnplay  lifetime warrantywe needed a powered usb hub to hook up scanner webcam and digital camera to our g imac
the first two on the list needed to be plugged in directly to the imac or to a powered hub so we were always shuffling plugs between these itemswe bought this dlink
scanner webcam both generated low power warnings on our screen and were unusuable
we had plugged in the power supply done everything as per instructionsfinally just returned this to amazon and bought an ibm hub for about  less at local computer store
it works finesoeither the dlink design is poor or we got a dud itemi would not buy another one from this company regardless of the modeland may not anything period
they cost two much to throw away
i also used the powersupply that came with it so low power didnt cause it to go nutsi bought this on the recommendation of an online review to use as a power hub for my iphone and ipad while traveling
apparently though it will provide power only through the power port
unlike say every other usb hub known to man
either that or the other three ports stopped working after three weeks and virtually no usealas i was in a hurry and didnt read the other reviews saying it was a piece of junk nor did i keep the packaging to return iti do wonder about the webpage where the other person said they were using it for exactly the purpose i wanted to use itto this day  october    the dlink hubs including this one will revert all the ports of itself to usb  when even only a single usb  device is plugged into it
so your usb  speed is goneit will not allow itself to be daisychained to an exact same model with any stabilitythe customer service department at dlink is beneath contemptsave your money and your aggravationthis is a nice usb hub
it doesnt have a bunch of annoying leds just one to indicate that it has power
it worked great right up until the two highamperage ports died no power no data connection
ive had this product for exactly one month and one day so im one day outside the return window for amazoni would like to some things change in future versions dont fail after a month im sure its not common but its still frustrating longer power cable
i bought this because i want ports accessible from up on my desk
the power cable hardly reaches and cannot be routed the way i would like to route it add mounting holes on the bottom
i would like to have mounted it on the underside of the edge of my deskupdate i bought another one of these to replace the one that stopped working
its started exhibiting the same failure condition that the last one did
i get power from the highamperage ports but no data
if this behaves like the last one power will also stop working on those ports soonsomething is wrong with thesei had hoped this would help me add all the usb items i have accumulated
sometimes it recognizes peripherals and other times not
just gave up and threw it in the trash went back to my  usb hub for nowi bought  dlink port usb hubs dubh last year for  different computers
 are in my home and one is at my dads house  i was instantly disappointed by the fact that this hub could not supply enough power to run an external usbbuspowered laptopsized dvd burner with nothing else attached to the hub
the cheap  port hub i bought on ebay that this hub replaced was able to power the dvd burner and  hard drives just fine until it crapped out
i ended up having to attach that dvdburner drive directly to one of the usb ports on the back of my computer to get it to work
after that the dlink seemed to work fine
until after about  months of use suddenly the external hard drives i had attached to the hub started randomly autonomously unmounting which in one case permanently damaged one of my hard drives
after a long and arduous process of elimination and lots of frustration i finally figured out that the dlink port usb hub dubh was the source of the problem
not long after that i started having similar problems with both of the other  dlink  port hubs
devices kept randomly unmounting and not just hard drives
in all  cases usb devices that were attached close to the center of the  usb ports are the ones that randomly drop while devices attached at the ends tend to not have this issue
considering that i had this same problem on  identical dlink hubs that were all purchased separately and all used on different computers it seems that the odds would indicate that this is a widespread problemi have since purchased  aluratek port usb hubs aluratek port usb  hub to replace the dlink and it has been smooth sailing ever since so far  months and no problems yet
the aluratek hub supplies much more power than the dlink did and i can even attach my external laptopsized dvd burner to the hub along with  hard drives an ipod touch a printer and a camera and they all work fine simultaneouslyconsequently i would highly recommend buying the aluratek port hub instead of this hub
i did a lot of searching before buying the aluratek and it seems to be the best port usb hub available on the market right nowincidentally the following  port hubs seem to be the exact same product as the aluratek but are sold under different brand names
aluratek seems to be the original equipment manufacturer however
so thats what id buy  check out the great reviews on all  of these devices to get an idea of how well they workport usb  hub blackcables unlimited usb usb  port desktop hub with poweramazons best price is currently on the oem product sold by aluratekaluratek port usb  hubi have two of these and replaced both because when i reboot my computer my usb peripherals are not there until i power cycle the hub
which is across the room both do the same thing with a variety of different peripherals
it took me awhile to figure out the problem was with the hub
try the cyberpower  port works greatthe charging ports stopped working completely about  months after receiving back in december of last yearreally upset that i have to deal with shipping and the fact that the email link on dlinks website for tech support doesnt work plus now id rather have a usb  hub and i wont be buying a dlinkit only charges devices for a few seconds then stops charging
very disappointed with dlink
will be returning it shortly for a better modeleither i got a dud or the product is poorly designed
i couldnt get ports  and  to work properly for usb mass storage devices
ended up returning this and adding pciusb interfaces to my desktop insteadit self destructed because the ports are too small and i tried to insert the wrong cable in one  it fell right insidethis hub is having a lot of problem handling a combination of devices such as ipod and external hard drives while they are all connectedi often need to connect two or three external hard drives to this hub to consolidate the files into a gb external drive
the hub does not provide enough power to have more that  of its  ports connected and when used with external drives you will see that at least one of the external drives depending on how many drives are connected would continuously connect and disconnect until the number of usb ports used is decreased by disconnecting some devicesi bought  and both behave identically so if you want to use several external hard drive and perhaps hook up your ipod at the same time you should look else where this hub will disappoint youi tried this hub for two months with only one printer plugged in hp cljl
after approximately a half a day the hub goes to sleep and the printer is not recognizedthe only solution i found was to unplug the power supply from the hub and plug it back in to reboot it
this is inconvenient for me because i need to have the hub installed behind a desk where i cannot get to it easilyupdate  sep i replaced the dlink hub with a targus acheu  port hub
it has worked continuously for more than  days now without dropping any peripherals offlineit appears the dlink hub was the problem
definitely not recommendedim baffled too
i dont know why a powered hub wont run my macally icekey keyboard or my canon s printer or the brand new canoscan lide scanner i had bought to use it with but it looks as if im back to square one
all of the above items worked as soon as i plugged them straight into my macminis usb ports
everything lights up ive plugged and unplugged the hub and each time i get the low power warning even for the keyboard
a hub like this is supposed to be plug and play especially on a mac
something is wrong somewhere
ive wasted an evening trying to get it to work
im out ups day shipping but im sending it backhad the unit  months before one port died
three months later the unit started producing power irregularities which meant the computer kept rejecting the ports
two strikes but im out
have to buy another unit
no more dlink for me
ive had other gear from this company and find that they dont build stuff for the longhaulupdate  after my device died  months i tried to get an rma to return it
dlink insists that i ship it back to them including all the stuff that came in the box like the quick installation guide
if i leave out that box litter which i no longer even have they will charge me  which is more than i paid for this device
additionally return shipping is at my costdlink warrantee is worthlesswhat they dont tell you is that you cannot use the main selling pointfast charge high current mode with an apple computer
same with linux
it only supports windows computers for that mode  on windows computers you have to install a driver that looks for ipads and only then activates high power mode
thus effectively it is worthless except for ipads not iphones on widows computers
the only way you can use the high power mode is to detach it from the computer so that its not a usb hub anymore then the hogh power mode turns on
that is its just an expensive wall charger not a usb hub  all this is documented in the instructions that come with it but not in the marketing literature
they get  star for being deceptiveupdate  there is now fine print at the bottom of the ad that says you have to turn off the computer to use fast charging mode
why is this big deal shoved into the fine print
update after  months it died
now i find its impossible to contact tech support at dlink
their socalled chat is just troubleshooting database not an actual human
ive sent three emails in the month and all i get back are automated responses
no rma number or instructions on how to get it replaced
the links for phone dont workhowever i did find a number to call them at gethumancom  to be able to get tech support do not choose the phone menu option for tech support as this will just give you another phone number to call that wont list this model on its endless phone menu
instead you have to select the customer service path on the phone tree
then they will say you need to talk to tech support first to get an rma number
they can transfer you to the right tech support phone queue
after an hour on hold you may get an rma number after they fruitlessly diagnose your dead box
you can then call back to customer service to return itor you can just not buy dlink products
if your time has any value this is a better optioni own one of these
every day or two it will flake out requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in in order for the computer to recognize any connected devices
furthermore whenever i try to use my usb scanner the scanning application crashes in midscan
none of this happens if i use my old linksys port hub
guess this goes into my drawer of broken electronics
im buying a linksys port hub insteadthe dlink make for a great night light
were making every effort to cut down on vampire electronics
i found a better product with less light pollutioni have tried using this hub multuiple times and every time it either locks up my computer or freezes it till i unplug it
programs stop working or work slowly
i used it to connect external hard drives and a wireless mouse
the mouse did not work at alldlink customer support says this hub cannot support external hard drives with capacities over  gb
makes this hub worthless in a time when you have to try really hard to find a drive with less than tb capacityi had this product for over  weeks
i have a brand new computer wth windows  and three times i had issues with either the mouse not working or the keyboard stop workingin addition the power cord in the back of the unit falls out i had to tape it down
in summary this product is junk like most of the usb hubs out there a lot of folks have problems with them if not now later they will im going back to manually move out usb jacks when i need them
the quality is not there for these products yet i mean they charge  for this stuff your not getting reliablity
they either burn out andor disconnect periodically
i rather pay  for a commerical grade product get it over with and not have the headachesi bought two of these to replace my slower belkin hubs but discovered that this product is not reliable
true i have a lot of usb devices but these hubs are supposed to handle seven devices at a time and they dont
i have braille devices and it is crucial that they work especially my braille display but it has quit working for no reason and my cd burner has also
and the hubs dont work with some devices especially my book port which is another adaptive technology device used by blind people
im back to my trusty but slower belkini am a fan of dlink network hardware for the home but i just got rid of this hub after many years of tedious ownership
i also dont normally rate devices with  star just because i dont like them
i just dont see how this device could do what it claims to dothe hub was a frequent pain especially when trying to run some devices concurrently with highpower devices like encrypted usb keys
i would have to unplug one device to use another
i finally gave up when the thing just would not initialize in windows correctly anymore when fully loadedbefore it apparently failed if i plugged in a highpower device alongside the key it would sometimes disconnect the key or cause it behave erratically
one possible reason was that  ports running at a full a power each would require a but the power adapter that came with the hub was only good for a
considering that it would also draw some power to function and to power those alwayson status lights there seems to be no way it could power  ports concurrentlythe lights on that hub were also useless because they were always on even when devices werent plugged in so im not sure what the point of them wasbear in mind that its possible there have been multiple hardware revisions of this hub so its hard to know whether the above problems exist in the current model but its something to consideri just got rid of this hub and replaced it with a belkin fu which has none of the above problems it has a a power adapter no status lights and looks nice on the desk
i am charging  devices concurrently as i type and have all ports loadedit glitches the chipset when its taxed on start up fully taxed hub system will fail to start might be funky bluescreen or just halt at bios better off with another usb controllerive used this for over a year and never suspected until reading here that all my troubles seem to be because the external power hookup is to power the always on useless green lights and not to supply extra power to the ports
if this is true then no wonder my external drives would sometimes disconnect at random or my ipad would not charge reliably
ugh if only id known earlier
why would they make something like that except into fooling you its something its not
very disappointed
oh well ill miss the christmas tree effect of the useless green lights at nite but not my external hard drives going off line at randombesides being unnecessarily big and bulky for the number of ports it supports it did not always worki had problems with my surface pro recognizing the devices i plugged into the ports
sometimes it would recognize them and at other times it would not
so i ended up ditching this device for the satech instead httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbergfvrefcmcrrypprdimgsolupdate i wanted to be fair to the dlink hub and say it is really a great little device
it deserves at least a  and maybe even a 
i spoke in anger and should have been more patient
antonline did a fair job and is not responsible once the item leaves their warehouses
the item is really a simple plug and play with a no brainr to operateforgive my anger and buy one of these if you need it because it works great
pcassidyi ordered this on the th from a seller less than miles from my home
this should have arrived on monday the st it is now the rd and it still has not arrived
if one pays for a timely delivery it should be provided
i honestly think the hub will be a fine item and just wanted to warn everyone to avoid purchasing from slow as ants online if you expect a timely delivery to your householdthe upper limit on my dlink port hub seems to be four devices regardless of whether they are self powered
some devices dont work properly in one port but do in another even if they are the only devices plugged into the hub
furthermore some devices seem to collide through the hub
for example only two of my usb drives will run concurrently
worse ive seen data corruption when a drive is plugged into four of the seven ports i thought a la cie usb hard drive was defective until i plugged it directly into the pc
the center three ports seem to blank out occasionally but recover after a rebootim on amazon now looking for a more reliable replacement
my experience with dlink products has been more miss than hitone final nit is the power connector jack is a right angle type and is a bit loose
i had to improvise a strain relief with tapelocks up the computer every time i plug it in to a known good port with a known good cable
support was no help at all
returned productsame with dlink usb bluetooth adapter
device drivers would not install and it was an oem of a toshiba producti wont be buying any more dlink productsi have one of these dubh hubs that i use on my home computer imac and it works perfectly and always hasfastforward to  years later and i purchased one for my office machine also an imac and almost the exact same model
this thing doesnt function well at all
it rarely recognizes a flash drive that i use to carry files back and forth from home to work and its never had that problem at home
when it does recognize the flash drive it randomly disconnects it and in the process corrupted a large document i was working on
luckily i had a backup at home from the previous day but i still lost a lot of timelooking through the reviews here it seems that although the model number of this new unit is the same as the one i purchased  years ago dlink has significantly changed the packaging accessories and apparently the internals andor design because im having the same problems that everyone else is having with power not being delivered via the powered ports usb devices disconnecting for no reason printers not being recognized etceven though this is the first problem ive had with a dlink product reading the reviews here and elsewhere has made it clear that i cant trust dlink to make a decent product anymore
i doubt ill ever purchase a dlink product again as it appears they dont care at all about the issues their customers are havinghave to agree with people on this it appears that the function of the power adapter is the light the leds on the unit
my iphone does not charge my blue tooth ear piece does not flash and my wd portable drive all report errors even as the only device plugged infeel a bit ripped off and i may of been better off going with a no name brand if this is dlinks job one workafter reading the mixed reviews on amazon i decided to take a leap of faith and purchase this usb hub
oh man o man o man i have had problem after problem after problem with this thingfirst off if all of your devices are not usb it will revert to usb
for usb purposes its decentsecondly i am experiencing massive and sporadic incompatibility issues with my  hard drives canon pixma  printer etci have never ever had any other problems with usb hubs so i assumed this would be a decent experience but its been a nightmareat first these hubs worked great
then slowly but surely they started to fail
dlink is a reputable company so i was surprised by the sudden failure of the devices
i kept my older version of the usb hubs grey metal as opposed to black plastic reinstalled them and they work just great the  and  usb ones i hardly throw anything away fortunatelythe reason i bought these is that they claim to power ipad ipod devices
they have a note saying that the computer will say it is not charging when it actually is
well after my ipad would not charge i said okay i can still use these for general purposesplease note four of these devices failed at different times
i tested each one at a time to determine if there was an overload fault of some kind tested them on other computers just to see if there were any kind of driver problems or other compatibility problems
once these puppies are dead they stay deadi do not recommend these devices and i recommend that you do not acquire themi bought four of these all at the same time and all from the same vendor
perhaps its a lot problem but they are all junk
they are constantly dropping connection and i have to unplug the hub and plug it back in to get the devices that are plugged into it to be recognized again
ive used these hubs on xp xp bit and vista and they drop connections on all
these are all different brands of computers and in two different physical locations so i know its not my computer
cables to go  port usb  hub that i replaced them with has had no problems with dropping connectionsi bought this hub two of them in fact lured by the promise of highspeed usb ports and the fact that it was powered the only thing the plug adapter seems to power however is the light that tells you its plugged in
the  cheapo unit i had hoped to replace did a better job of maintaining connection with external drives which constantly spin downramp up using this unit and even my wacom tablet refuses to connect through these overpriced pieces of dlink
no smart phone  from the iphone gs to an ancient android  can be charged with this unit and many devices just plain dont seem to connect at all and those that do dont stay connected for longextremely disappointedplugged it in right away i started getting shocked next came the blue screen at shut down warning about usb device called dlink couldnt understand them they couldnt understand me dont you love outsourcing they didnt even know what a hub was kept asking me which windows i was using
finally after them asking what do you mean shocked
i just told them it was saying vulgar things to me and hung up
never again and i bought two of these
bill in las vegasi owned this hub for a year and twice had to call dlink for a rma number to exchange it under warranty
after the third one died i just gave up
i spent more on shipping than i would have spent on just buying a new hub from a different manufacturerso what went wrong
in each case the hub seemed to overheat and die
i could actually smell that distinct odor of frying circuit board
never had anything particularly powerhungry hooked up two ipods a scanner a digital camerai understand if it happened once or even twice but three times a bad hub
not likely
since the new hub i got from a different manufacturer is working well then the conclusion must be that it is the dlink design that is at faultwhats not specified in the item description is that if you mix and match usb  and usb  devices the hub may only provide the much slower usb  speed for all ports
you dont read that in the product description
you have to wait until you purchase the item and read the documentation
so dont plug an ipod mini and a usb  device in my case a wireless mouse into the same hub or your ipod may have major problems as mine did
the ipod wants to run at full usb  speedswhy is there a problem with the manufacturer providing that info in the description before you purchase the hub
this is highly deceptive in my opinionsometimes you just know that a product is going to be a disaster and sometimes you know it will be a delight
alas i quickly started getting disaster vibes  even during the installation process with the dlink dbtthe installation onto my xp professional os dell laptop was different on screen than suggested by the user guide on the cd and quick install guide
a bad start
it required two reboots during the course of the install  surely unnecessary with win xp
and most objectionable of all i had to key in a  character security code to register the software  how stupid is thatanyway eventually i got it installed and working but it was very difficult to understand or use
for example what do you think that an object push link is
whatever it is i have two of them nowthe software would occasionally generate error messages that sometimes didnt seem to mean anything and other times probably didanyway after a month of not using it i needed to use it again with my nokia   but when i went to use it i could no longer get the devices to communicate and after speaking with tmobiles helpful customer support we identified the problem  a missing dlink driverso i called dlinks misnamed customer support
after  hours on the phone sure with several disconnects during that time and speaking with four different people none of whom could solve my problem a supervisor interrupted to say that it wasnt their responsibility to fix the missing dlink driver so that it would talk to the outside world
the level two support person whod been struggling to help me said he had to therefore end the call and couldnt help any more
he suggested i place a message asking for help in a news groupthe software interface is impossible to understand and when it doesnt work youre on your own
unacceptable in all respectsit does not say anywhere on the documentation of the item that it is not windows vista compatible
i tried to look for drivers and there are none to speak of
unfortunately i wasnt able to return this item because my housekeeper accidentally threw it away
if you dont have vista im sure it works finethis product does not work with windows vista
when i got it it would not install properly
i went to dlinks web site to see if there was an updated driver but it showed that they did not have drivers for vista
i called dlinks sales department as it is impossible to get to a live person in their technical support department and the sales rep told me that they do not have a driver for this device for use on pcs running vistathankfully  i was able to return it to the store after  days
so what was wrong with it firstly  for hardware revision b the software just would not install some error about security code not being valid
wasted many hours over this
a call to dlink tech support resulted in an email from them that only repeated steps i had already tried
not very helpful and more waste of timei wrote back in a stern manner  and tech support finally got back with a solution that involved installing the older driver along with a security code that they generatedok  i was willing to live with this much
when i tried to use the device with the jabra  bt headphone i managed to get a range of around  feet and there was absolutely no signal one room away
even within a room  signal was weak by the time i went to the end of the room
what was this claim about  feet range
this was awful performance and i decided i had enough and returned the productfast forward to my linksys usbbt  
firstly  it installed in a snap
the jabra  now works through the furthest corner of the other rooms  no breakup  nothing
boy  what a glaring differencei for one will stay away from dlink for a long time to comefirst of all im a microsoft certified professional
im not a deep geek but i understand internet communication and what constitutes ease of usethe dlink dbt usb dongle does plenty of ugly undocumented things
for example it constantly monitors the bluetooth exchange folder which strangely slows my mhz systemwhats very annoying is that it hooks into microsoft office applications and adds a menu option send to bluetooth
this pings my firewall on udp every time i start an office application and even though ive allowed that port it totally locks up my computer the firewall logs show it allowing the communication and blocking the communication
right now i have to disconnect from the internet shut down my firewall start the office app then restart my firewall
i have this problem even when i kill the background process bttrayexe which tells me that dlink is hooked into my system in a very very naughty waythis appears to be firewall independent  after prowling the newsgroups i see that this occurs regardless of the firewall you useso i called dlinks tech support
they require your full name telephone number full address and an email address
if you do not give them any of this they will not help youafter many calls to dlinks tech support im  sure that all the problems are dlinks fault
how do i know
for example when they tell you to call microsoft
thats an old tech support trick to get you off the phone
or when they tell you to uninstall the product then reinstall it
i did that the first time they told me
but in subsequent calls they told me to do it again
thats another tech support trick to get rid of youi called dlinks tech support eight times in one day each times hoping id get someone knowledgeable
each call including initial hold times and can you please hold lasted at least  minutes  the longest was  hour  minutes after which they hung updlink tech support is definitely not technical
im not exaggerating when i tell you that they are not technical
nobody knew what a port is
nobody
nobody is technical
nobody
except for three of my eight calls they either hung up or placed me on hold and forgot about me
i know now that if i had bothered to check forums on the internet beforehand id know that this is how dlinks support behaves when they cant solve a problemi got one dlink tech support guy who told me that its your fault for using microsoft
you should switch to linux
i was absolutely speechless
can you believe this
when i regained my composure politely asked him are you saying dlink products are incompatible with windows
 he placed me on hold where i was disconnected after ten minutesdlink bluetooth is horrible
their tech support is shameful and a disgrace
their software is intrusive and does many ugly and undocumented things that slow your system and possibly violate your privacy i dont have time to go into the other firewall issues  ex it tries to access an outside ip addressthis product is to be avoided at all costsi bought this product because i use them on my macs so i figured stick with dlink on this but what a mistake  the driver is a total disaster
it loads generic drivers then it complains about a security code then if you get that all worked out the driver will then declare you do not have a valid license
this thing is useless in windows
that driver is a joke
seriously do not buy this for windows it will not worki have wasted hours on this device trying to use it
after about  minutes of rebooting and driver installationreinstallation i can usually get it to work for a little while before one of widcomm driver programs crashes
once a program crashes it requires another  minutes of work
avoid this device for any windows usefrom the reviews it looks like mac users have better luck with this than windows users
i tried to install on windows xp and it never worked
just say nowouldnt work with built in winxp drivers requires you to load bloatware to run
even after loading the bloat couldnt get win xp to recognize the device the drivers are dicey
called support and they were worthless
guy said something akin to gee that shouldnt happen and decided the device must be faultythis didnt work with my laptopphone combination ibm thinkpad t  lg env
amazon was great about returning it and i received a full refund and they paid for shippingdevice driver would not install
simply hangs
second this is an oem of a toshiba bluetooth adapter
i cannot stand oemd products such as this because the support is terrible
returning the productalso bought a dlink usb  hub that locked the computer every time i plugged it in to a known good port using a known good cableprobably wont ever buy dlink againafter countless attempts to install this product i called customer support only to be informed by their technical support that this unit was not compatible with my operating system windows vista
needless to say i returned the unitwindows vista doesnt completely recognize the device when you plug it in and while it then recognized my bluetooth headset it would not communicate with the headset at all
when i tried installing the software from the included cdrom vista blocked the installation as incompatible and vista sent me to a toshiba website
oops
the drivers which were installed show up in device manager as toshiba drivers not dlinktoshiba absolutely refuses to talk to me about it and dlink says it will not work with vista and i should return it for a refunddlink has no plans to support vista
they dont have drivers they say theyre not working on drivers and they say there is no schedule under which they intend to ship drivers
ok all of that was said by someone in india and who knows if they know actual dlink policy
others have said this product works with vista
well in my case a new hp media center pc not only does the software fail to install it modifies my desktop and screws things up bad enough that i had to use system restore to back up to a checkpoint
nice feature of vista checkpoints are automatically created often enough that you dont have to remember to make one before installinglesson learned
if their website says xp sp or higher that means it only works on xp
nowhere else
now i wonder if amazon will take it backafter about  hour with technical support which was responsive but unable to solve the problem i was able to connect one time
i could never connect after that
so i gave up
i have  bluetooth usb connectors that connect effortlesslyi am using the dbt ver b to operate the wireless apple keyboard and mouse
if my computer goes into the sleep mode i cannot wake it up by typing on the keyboard and i have to use the power key on the apple monitor
when the computer does eventually wake up it takes a good  min before the mouse would work
apple tech support says that they have seen this problem and went through a few solutions but none worked and i was asked to talk to dlink
the dlink tech supports told me that their software stops running when the computer goes to sleep and that is why my keyboard and mouse do not work and there is no solution to that
thus if you plan to use dlink when the computer goes to sleep it wont work
i am sticking with my wired keyboard and mouse nowi have one of these mice but it wasnt purchased here
like several other microsoft mice i have purchased it came with a defective microswitch under the left button
most of the time it works but sometimes when you singleclick you get a double
microsoft mice used to be great they are no morei have purchased  or  of the past couple years out of brand loyalty and only  of them worked correctly out of the box and it only lasted a few monthsthe driver for this mouse caused my dell vista system to freeze repeatedly which it had never ever done before
i put my old dell mouse back on but the system kept freezing
i called the support number in the mouse software help screen to get advice on how to uninstall the software but it referred me to a new number for paid support at  per call
so i hunted up a microsoft support number and got an overseas call center
i spoke with three agents all of whom insisted that the product id number on the back of my mouse had insufficient digits   digits vs the  my mouse carried
lacking a valid pid number they refused to connect me with free tech support but only offered me paid support
ive waited a long time to speak with a supervisor  as i write this ive been on the phone to ms for a full hour with no help at all
im still on hold
where will it end
oh
 minutes into the call the line went dead
i guess thats microsofts commitment to customer service in action
now im on the phone to ms itself via the corporate number i got from google finance
theyre concerned that the pid lacks digits but theyve finally told me how to uninstall this
total time on the phone was  hour and  minutes
now to call amazon to return this chinesemade piece of junk  update microsoft speculated that the mouse was counterfeit owing to its not having a valid product id number
so thats fun
returning the wretched thing to amazon turned out to be wonderfully simple
wouldnt you like to know before you order what country these things are made inmicrosoft usually makes top drawer stuff
it is hard to believe they made this piece of im not allowed to use that language in a review
this thing just doesnt work right
its supposed to have multiple buttons that are programmable with different compatible programs
the right click button was magnifing instead of the depression of the wheel and though the right click could be returned to default with the programming options the wheel could not
this is suitable for trap shooting
throw it into the air and go boomthe right click broke
i should have expected a problem like this  it is made by microsoft
next time ill go with a better brand like logitech kensington or belkinits extremely unfortunate but i cant help looking at this as a predatory product
theres no good reason to make the camera require a proprietary design to begin with but then to charge this much money for it  its insulting
the quality is fine but for less than half the cost you can buy a charger plus four aa batteries and recharge them galore
heck you could buy three more sets of perfectly good aa batteries and never ever run out of juiceim a canon fan but enough is enough
the cameras excellent the lenses are fair to good the ac adapter is a bad buy for the moneythese were recommended as frequently purchased with the plantronics headset i purchased
i did not order at the time but when the very flimsy ear covers on an otherwise great portable usb headset fell off and were lost in the first month of ownership i ordered them
even though they said they fit my model i still checked the measurements
all good  until they arrived
way too small
frustratinghoped to replace an aging microphone screen with this one and eventhough it met the specs it tore immediately and fell off  so  waste of money bucks for this
ok i was desperate and leaving the country for a month and did not have time to go to radio shack
i thought it must be a particularly good one for this price
but the cost to produce this must be about  cents if that
should be a pack of  for  bucks item not one flimsy cover for  bucks
i feel genuinely ripped offthis switch did not work this product would mute in reverse i could not hear the person on the other end but they could still hear me
not good
dont know why followed instructions and tried multiple configurations
this product would be great if you did not want to hear the other party but for some reason you still wanted them to hear youwish i could get me money backthis is not what i was looking for i was looking for only that only had audio not audio and micthis is a waste of money space and plastic
save your money invest in a real headset and avoid adaptersi can only hear but mic doesnt get picked up
enough saidi have tried this with my polycom phone and polycom headset nothing but static
save yourself the grief and buy the amplifieri bought this for my  year old motherfatherinlaw who are both hard of hearing
the unit did not work all that well for the short time it worked and then it just pooped outit made like a toy and does not sound loud
actually my current cordless phone is louder than this one
it has been returnedconnected the headset to avaya phone on headset jackchecked the manual  httpecimagesamazoncommediaidamanmigratemanualpdfmic is not working 
i am able to hear headphones are workingdoes one require additional base system for this to work ive used this with several t yealink phones and with all of them callers on the other end cannot hear metry something else
wish i hadthe unit did not work when i received ittotally forgot that i could return it as some issues in other areascame up and i had forgotten about this headsetso these are supposed to work in stand alone cd recorders
not quite
when the cds arrived
half of the cds i tried in my recorder werent recognized no opc and those that did i had to put in my machine more than once in order for my machine to recognize the opc code so i could record on the disc
hmm not exactly what i was looking for so they are going back
guess i should have stuck with maxell
ill be correcting that mistake as i return these discsi bought  packages of these and they were all defectivenot for digital audio music recorders
i called tdk which make imation media
they told me to check out each disk and send them the defective ones
well all  are defective
so they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder
my dual cd philips machine didnt recognize these disks which say tdk music
the recorder rejected every one
either it gave a error or said insert disc meanwhile it was in there
i dont recommend these model  discs for the philips dual cd recorder
i always bought tdk all my life and since imation is involved i no longer buy them
i use maxell only for the dual philips recorder
i bought  discs and work flawlessly
if you have the philips cdr dual deck use the maxells they are worth it
they say on them cdr music for digital audio  min and are used for the philips dual deckthese cdrs from tdk have been a real disappointment  they dont play in some cd players will play sporadically in otherstheres a problem here that in my experience seems specific to the tdk music discsi recently purchased a  pack of the tdk music audio cdrs as well as a memorex  pack
the memorex worked great  usable
the tdk not so much
so far i am seeing about  failure rate
either my cr recorder philips brand cant recognize it or if it does it wont finalize it after recording
would not recommend these to anyone
however different recorders react differently
mine doesnt like the tdk brand
recommend buying a single cdr or two and trying out before investing in a whole spindle of coastersi bought these at best buys and what a waste of money
after i just opened it and started to write on the discs all the pens did not write clear and some were dryed out
only the red worked fine but the rest smudged all over the disc like it was a paint brush
save yourself from a headache dont buy these markersthe markers were dried up but i was given an immediate refund so im happy about thati have these and a bunch of tdk brand cd markers
after comparing these to the tdks im trashing the memorex ones
they are that badthese pens will write just fine on disks that dont have an unlabeled mirror finish
on those disks however the black ink turns light gray as it dries
i did not try the other colors but the other reviews are certainly discouraging
what types of disks have mirror finishes
i have two from different manufacturers one of which is the archival quality mama k gold the other being a generic disk from workunfortunately the only reason i bought these pens was for use with the archival disks
after all ive been using sharpie markers on disks since the invention of the recordable cd and ive had very very few ever fail after passing an initial test
since i was archiving a sparetime project that i had completed over  years i wanted to do everything i could to preserve it  thus the special disks dvds and pens
i did find one pen that works on the mirrorfinish disksarchival gold cddvd safe pen solvent free
these archival gold pens will occasionally have the same problem unless you scribble on a piece of paper first which seems to make the ink flow better
i tried that with the memorex pens and it didnt work
btw when im writing on disks i try to keep some purell or equivalent alcoholbased hand sanitizer close by along with some tissue
if you dont wait too long to apply it purell will remove markings from disks without a trace
when working with archivalquality disks you might just want to use ethyl alcohol since it is recommended by archival disk manufacturers
we cant forget that the name of the game here is to avoid depositing potentially damaging chemical residues on the disksdont shoot the messengertimi bought this thinking since its expensive it will be better
but i plugged it in and the red light came on i read the manual and it said if the red light comes on you need to change the wiring at your housewhich i didnt have time nor money for it then i threw it away and bought a cheap one which is working perfectthe item would not work or pass power from one side of the unit to the other
led indicators did not power up eitherlike other reviewers i found out the hard way that it does indeed partially block one of the outlets which then can only be used by the smallest plughead like a lamp cord
i have an ac adapter and a fat tv power cord going into an outlet and i cant use this surge protector with them together
i would need to buy a short extension cord to accommodate the surge protector and even then it would be a tight squeeze into the outlet
the older design was square and fit perfectly
i have an older one on my other tv with the same setup and it fits fine
why they changed the design and made it taller is beyond me but they screwed up
hey tripp lite
ditch the tall design and go back to what works
if it aint broke dont fix itmy screen turns yellow on a regular basis i guess this was a faulty unitwhen i get a chance i will probably send it back in the meantime i have invested in a raritran switchman kvm switch a much better value for money propositionthe circuit breaker tripped after a few months
i tried the reset  no go
it was irreparably burned outtripp lite super outlet surge protector  joules ft
cordamazon product available at most computer storesi would normally give any tripp lite product a  star rating but cannot in this individual caseat  i really hate to go out in the car and shop in computer stores for things i want even though i have professional accounts with major distributors here in the northeastamazon has changed my shopping experience for the most part and i rarely send anything back but this time i willwhile the product probably would be fine under normal circumstances  packaged properly before shipping and then having the product work in the most common way in the communications world of we the technicians this product doesnt live up the normal tripp lite expectationsit was not packaged properly on all sides to prevent damage to the strip
it was packaged on the top and sides but not on the most sensitive part the bottomif you are a person that receives almost all the things you buy through ups or fedex you also know that these delivery people are literally running and throwing boxes of product dailymy package came quickly and the box was not damaged but  when an item of electronics such as a surge strip riding in the back of a truck which rides very hard i have little trust as to the item working properly and can not know if it can now work correctlyjust as important to me is this is the first time i have ever gotten a quality surge protector that a red light stands for good groundfor those of us who have worked in the tech industry we like all indicator lights to be green meaning everything is working fine that we installed and to go look for the problem elsewhere when a computer or telephone system stops workingsince most of us will forget rather quickly that this particular item is different will we remember that the red light in this case means good
i know most people including me do not want to make an exception and start making red start meaning something good as opposed to not working properly or improperly groundedi have returned the product in favor of using the standard apc or tripplite products using green for good and red for not working properlyamazon needs to do some work in their description of products being sold especially when speaking of surge strips and in a world where people here in the northeast get lightning storms frequently with trees falling across lines causing surges but also carstrucks knocking down power lines with the same result of power spikesthe average person has no idea how often they get a surge because they just are unaware that many other things can cause surges and they are more common in some areas than others
your surge strip is one of the most important purchases you will ever make and should not be taken lightly everi did not actually use this surge protector
i was looking for something that i felt would be better protecting my equipmentbroke after a year of usage
the retractable prongs wouldnt stay up
the switch that controls retractable prongs broke and the whole thing was uselessbe careful  there are two different versions of this
be sure to buy the correct one not this one theres a power delay when in use during a surge
the other one looks just like it and the portability is greatwhile traveling in china i hooked up this charger to a sharper image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking
a much better buy would be the sony charger with worldwide voltage and for  dollars lessthese items are very thin
i purchased because i tried to install a new pci network switch i had on hand in a new windows  bit computer just to find out it was not compatible with window  biti then needed to purchase a replacement and got a pci express card instead
i never use the built in network cards due to all of the lightning in my area
would rather risk blowing a network card and reduce the chances of main board damage
at least you have a  shot of only damaging the card
not always helpful but sometimes it works outanyway my new computer had the type of mounting where you can not put screws in the filler plates or any add on card to lock them in place you can just put the cap over the cards and plates to hold them in placewith this item being so thin it just rattled around in the slot opening and if you just touch it it will fall outit you can screw your plates in place these may be ok but if you can not i suggest more a more solid product or find the kind that will clip in the hole and not require any thing else to hold it in placecouldnt get it to work with mach
i followed all the steps from artsoft themselves and couldnt get it to work
i ended up buying a smoothstepper board and within  minutes i was turning partsno instructions provided  just the adapter in a plastic bag
hp inkjet printer
i read in the user reviews how some people have gotten it to work and went through the steps
tried different suggestions for hours
the only way i could get it to print was to let the print job fail and then reboot
upon startup the printer would then print the job
obviously of no use
very disappointedi was hoping this would replace some quirky usb to serial converter cables i was having issues with on my pc
it was a disappointment
maybe serial devices werent meant to be in  anymorethe connectors on the card i received are different from the one depicted on the amazon webpage
i cannot use it because it does not fit into my pcs slot
now its too late to return it unfortunatelythe product picture and part number match but they together do not math the descriptioni can only say that you need to be assured that this card will work with your computer
this cards terminalsslot do not line up with my yearold dell  in all fairness however dell is known to use suppliers that supply unusual configurations
for example dell printer ink could only be purchased from dell because other cartridges would not fitworki ordered this fan for my asus sabertooth p motherboard which requires a mm x mm x mm fan with tx connector
i received an opened startech packet containing a mm x mm x mm evercool fan with no tx connector
its a really big trash and because i live outside us i will not return it
really badand it costs  times more
lesson learned
dont be fooled by silver its just silver dyemy unit  ive discovered too late  has an internal ground circuit problem
it puts intermittent bands on any passthrough vga and on the converted rca composite output
the dirty output is so bad ill have to replace this
im stunned startech would release such a cheaplymade product
very disappointed
wish i could send it back for a refundthe only way i could make it work was to hold the svideocomponent switch halfway in
other than that it seemed to work fine
seriously though  holding the switch is not acceptable
i returned this itemfirst reviewsimply put this item was doa straight out of the box
i attempted all of the following as input devices wii console vcr dvd playerand both of the following as displays  viewsonic crt monitor  samsung lcd monitorand regardless of the configuration i got the exact same result  no signal
i will attempt one exchange
if that one is doa as well i will get a refund
after getting the replacementi would like to amend a prior review where i gave  star saying i would give  if i could because it just didnt work
well the replacement does work and i have successfully run the wii through the analog port on my  lcd monitor
thats the good newsthe bad news piping sound through it is bad
really bad
tin cans and a string bad
fortunately you dont have to and i dont any more
you just have to be inventive with your cabling
 the video quality isnt great but this may be as good as it gets with composite
results might be better with svideo but i dont have anything that delivers that
i blame outdated standards here
 it doesnt drive x like you may see in the specs it drives x
this makes the next point all the more confusing it doesnt work with my  crt monitor which i had intended to turn into a tv with this a vcr and a pair of amplified speakers
the monitor works fine on the analog port of the video card so theres nothing wrong with it
it just doesnt get along with the video game jockeyalso of note is that it sends an output signal even when there is no input signal
this means that if your monitor autodetects source it will lock onto the blankscreen analog signal if you try to connect the analog to the jockey and the dvi to your computer
i can forceswitch it but occasionally it still flips back over to analog and is guaranteed to if the machine is rebooted and it wont go to sleep because its always getting a signal
this can be dealt with by switching the jockey to use the vga input even though i havent connected anything to it
it does not attempt to drive a blank signal this way
i just have to remember to switch it back before i can use the wiiin short it does what it says other than the x part but it has crappy sound quality and doesnt work with all monitors
 starsthis thing just stopped working about  days after i bought it
i cant believe it
it seemed sturdy good quality but then died
whats worse it had only been used once or twice as an extension cord for my power drillomg
i cant believe itmy fellowes surge protector was taken right of the box brand new from the amazon packaging and plugged into an electical outlet
pop
lights and everything electronic in the room stops
hmmm
reset the breaker
plug it into a different outlet pop
hmm
reset
plug this item into an outlet other side of the house popso to double check everything plug this device into an outlet at a friends home  same thing popobviously my unit had some kind of internal short circuit right out of the box and was completely unusablea new one might have worked great but in my situation i sent it back to amazon and will spend a couple dollars more and buy the  outlet  joule surge protector from belkin insteadthank god for great customer service from amazoncomi have a customer with three hpdn printers that used these n cards
with these three printers they now have seven dead n cards with the hp acknowledge built in fault
we just recently ordered a set of newer style cards to replace the last three working ns in the printers
hp really screwed up on these and did not make it right with their baseive had two of them in my lone home laserjet
neither lasted more than  months and the last required a cold reset of the printer a couple of times a week
both the printer and jetdirect have to be reconfigured after each cold resetsince it was not completely dead hp wouldnt replace or repair it under warranty  but they did generously offer a tradein for  plus taxfor the last  years ive been using a cheap zonet tcpip print server which is small enough to fit inside the printer and plugs into its usb port
you cant configure the printer over the lan like you can with the jetdirect
but temporarily connecting the printer directly to a computer once in  years to run the hp config utility is a small price to pay for increased reliability
problem free and you can buy six of them for what this costsjetdirects have nice configuration tools if youre managing a lot of hp printers over a network
but theyre otherwise troublesome and overpriced
ns now discontinued are notorious for a high failure ratei have  of these s that are good for nothing
all  of them came from printers and just stopped working one day separately
they wouldnt even show up in the printer menus as an installed device
unfortunately they were out of warranty  new ones were the fix dont get the s  they probably wont lastltedityes  its the card that failed
when i put the card into another printer the cards still wouldnt show
when i put a known working card into the original printers  the printer works againthis lock is poorly designed
upon setting a new combination code and attempting to plug into my laptop found it very hard to turn dials away from my code to engage the lock
once removed from laptop the lock somehow reset in the locked position and my code would no longer work
followed all the directions
also the lock is quite wobbly on the computer even with the supplied spacers
buy the kensington keyed lock instead you wont regret itthis thing was quite for the first couple of days and now its pretty loudto the point where i cant handle the noisewaste of money on this fanits not vibrating off the usb outletthe actual fan is loud
if you put some pressure on it it then quiets downi purchased the port desktop usb  hubthey changed logo design and mostimportantly to me they changed the leds from blue to red
i didnt even bother opening it
you cant trust the other reviews since this is a reviseddifferent producteverything i have is silver aluminum case with blue leds monitor etc
i bought this overpriced simple device based on it being able to match
it doesntmost of the reviews here are from  to  years old
they are for a different productrevisionthis review is for the  port pau targus usb hub
another lump of plastic for my junk box
save your money and buy the connectland for half the price of this one
mine was dead on arrival
i thought it was maybe the power supply seeing as it has a  volt external power port
i went thru many places looking and finally used an old cell phone charger that had the same matchup config
still didnt work for me
no blue lights no recognition at all when i plugged it in
basically useless
if i hadnt taken it apart to look inside for power problems i would return it
but it looks pretty in my box with my other useless dead computer peripheralspurchased july  its now aug th and the thing is dead
no power
dunno what the warranty is am going to try and contact them but honestly that amount of time indicates the thing sucksbought this item for use at the office
we rarely used it
after a few months it just stopped working
it now makes a grinding noise when it tries to access any floppy disk
next time ill try to buy something a little more reliable
glad it worked for so many reviewers
unfortunately it didnt work very long for me so i cant recommend iti bought this for a laptop to do photoshop work on when my beloved trackball broke
i thought cordless might be worth it but this cordless requires a plug in io unit as big as an average mouse
might work for a tower unit but having a huge chunk that will hang off a ps slot and a soso designed trackball as a separate unit i also have to haul around is a non starter
once i saw that huge chunky plug in unit that allows this thing to be cordless it went right back into the packaging and was returned
why would you pay more for cordless when you end up with a corded unit to power your cordless unitthe ad did not show the receiver and that fact that it was on a cord
this device might be good for a desktop application but not for a laptop or traveleralthough a vertical style design this mouse still requires quite a bit of wrist pronation to grasp
too much for my comfort so i returned iti have tendinitis which prevents me from using a mouse on the right side even though im right handed
i must use a trackball on the left sidethis is yet another wireless trackball from logitech that only works for the right handlogitech has no excuse for leaving out lefthanded people
it is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sidesapparently the logitech marketing department must think that lefthanded people must love wires since all their wireless trackballs are for righthanded people only
i wouldnt be posting this negative review if they had a wireless trackball product that worked for me  but they just dont have anyi used it for  yrs from  to 
then it stopped workingi found out that i needed an updated softwarei tried to update it from the logitech website but still could never get it to work rightthe old expression a camel is a horse designed by a committee best describes the logitech cordless optical trackmanright mouse switch this is the only good switch on the mouse
easy to use and a nice light tactile response
how often do you right click thoughleft mouse switches they are small and require x as much pressure as the right mouse switch to activate
using them is like having to push on stiff little warts all day
if you suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome these switches sill be sending waves of pain through your thumb by the end of the dayscroll wheel  the awkward placement of the scroll wheel was obviously driven by available real estate on the device as opposed to ease of use
it is as fluid to operate as a pepper grinder
the micro buttons are still little contraptions that require you to lift your hand off the mouse so that you can press straight down
theyre essentially tiny useless little thingsbad wrist design  this trackball puts a lot of bad pressure on the wrist
if you have carpal tunnel syndrome youll feel it quick
if not the wrist design flaw of this trackball will likely cause you to develop carpal tunnel syndrome sooner than laterthis company designed the venerable marble fx
it was an elegant trackball and used ones sell for x the original price on ebay
it is a shame they abandoned form and function ergonomics in favor of gizmos and competitive check listsi was very disappointed with this item so much so that i sold it again and purchased another kensington trackballthis was a good mouse until logitech discontinued it a couple of years ago
because it is really hard to get now crazy prices
the original trackball was around anyone who pays more than  must be trying to launder large sums of moneyi bought this product about  years ago to use with my windows vista laptop
it worked offandon with driver issues and connectivity issues
i chalked it up to vista not playing well with it and put it on my shelf
flash forward to last week
i have a shiny new windows  laptop and thought hey lets give it another go
it connects just great and works beautifully for about  days
now same issues
it wont connect
it wont stay connected
the logitech setpoint driver doesnt recognize it
it had brand new batteries last week but i put in two more freshly opened batteries today
im using it and i watch the mouse pointer start to stutstutstutter across the screen and then freeze
now it wont connect againhorrid garbage which is now where it rests  in the bottom of the garbage under coffee grounds and cat littermy son has a logitech cordless optical trackman   uses it as a back up to a corded mouse
he likes it but when i go one and tried it i kept scooting it along the keyboard pullout table
the logitech cordless trackball works much better for mei have an hp laserjet ml postscript and an hp deskjet   relatively common printers
i have a pc running windows me and an imac running osx
i havent been able to get either computer to work with either printer the printers work fine when connected directly to the computer  but that defeats the purpose of having a print server
i struggled with the useless manual for hours then called tech support twice
the tech support people seemed as clueless as i was
we walked through the standard printer setup process but still nothing worked
using the ip address of the server i can use the web browser to see that both printers are connected and properly identified by the server but for some reason the print jobs wont go through
i bought this product based on the reviews i found here but somebody should let me in on the secret to setting this thing up
after an hour and a half with tech support not a tollfree call they basically had nothing more to offer
im curious if this is a problem with hp printers  i know hp sells its own print servers  maybe rd party servers dont work
if that is so somebody should say itbottom line  if you intend to use this with an hp printer you may want to ask lots of questions and verify that it will work before you buy itwell after trying to get this item to work for several weeks and having used up a full ink cartridge im sending it back
their product description is very untrue i was never able to get the bidirectional functionality to work the only way i was able to get my printers to work was to use the ip protocol their tech support advised me that that would be the only option and i run windows xp
this is a terrible product and i will never again purchase anything by hawking tech especially with other companies that put out products that actually work
what makes my waste of time and resources even worse is that amazoncom will charge me for the shipping
oh well lessons learneditem did not state it was not   as is current models in this pro line
of no use for purpose i needed
there response was not  good so will just not use them or recommend themmy second netgear fs v just died
neither was over a year old
it didnt actually die and i wish it had because then i would have at least had a good head start on where my problems were
instead it just quits transmitting the internet
it is actually still working with some noninternet components but after having two of them fail for the same reason i am donei bought this so i could have an internet connection with both my xbox  and my computer
but even though they were both plugged into this only one would have the internet connection
kind of pointless to have  ports on this if only one thing is going to keep the internet connectionhad for about   yrs
it go haywired last night flashing leds unable to reset
no reset button unplugged all cat cables and power supply with different power outlet with no avail
never knew an unmanaged switch can malfunction unoperaterable
th product from netgear made didnt last from mos to  yr however this switch has lasted the longest
will stay away from all netgears product from nowso heres the thing when i lived in phoenix and i had this certain cable internet provider and it worked
granted i had a bit of trouble getting it to work right off the bat
but then it worked and that was thatthen i move to albuquerque and this other cable internet provider and i could not get it to work
i even called netgear and even though the guy on the line was very nice and very helpful it still wouldnt worki finally went down to the store and got myself a new router by a different manufacturer and that one worked
ltshrugi purchased this router  months ago
after  months with no problems the unit suddenly stopped working
a call to netgear produced unsatisfactory results
technical support will not talk to you unless you pay a premium
with only six months elapsed on a  year warranty i notice that now netgear only offers a  year warranty  interesting i was not happy
i did not want to spend any more money so i tried the online support
after back and forth for a week netgear finally issued an rma number so i could ship the defective unit back at my expense
the only acceptable service in this whole mess was the turnaround time
i mailed it priority on jan th and received the replacement jan th
the router worked  whole day and died jan th
as a courtesy customer service decided to talk to me after verifying that i had just received the new defective router
that phone call turned into  as i was cut off twice and had to keep calling back too bad they couldnt call me back since they have my phone numberthat would have been much better customer service
each time i had to repeat my story always write down your case id  so they can find you so i ended up speaking with  different technicians who each had me do something different which is my complaint with the online support  different people something else to try all of which i had done prior to calling
the last technician referred me to a supervisor who assured me another replacement would be sent out promptly
she said i could throw the bad unit away
 minutes later she called back asking for my credit card information to authenticate me
i refused stating that she had confirmed all my info prior to hanging up
she refused to let me speak to someone with more authority telling me my repalcement couldnt be processed without a credit card although she assured me i would not be charged for a new unit or shipping
so why do they need my credit card
customer service has not called me but i did get an email from them issuing another rma
i am furious as i will not ship their defective product back to them particularly since the supervisor told me i did not have to and could toss it nor will i give them a credit card which i am guessing goes to people in a foreign country based on their hard to understand accents
netgear has lost another customer my computer is unprotected at the moment but before i unplug my ethernet cable i will file a complaint with the better business bureauif you know anything about routers do not buy this one  it will drive you nuts
first tech support will refuse to give you the simplest of information the router ip address without first registering your product online
if you have a complicated network setup this can be a nightmare having to connect a computer directly to the router to optain a dhcp lease get the ip address then put it back into your existing setupthere is no documentation that comes with the router
the cd contains some pathetically dumbed down garbage but mostly just useless diagramsthe router also utilizes what has to be the stupidest thing ive ever seen  a setup wizard with no option to skip or go directly to advanced setup
this setup wizard will check for an internet connection and fail out if none is detected
in other words unless youre connected to the internet when setting up the router you cant even set up the damn thingin my opinion something as mindblowingly stupid is that is a severe product defect
it was returned within an hour of purchasesome  h over a month period was spent trying to program this device and get it to connect to the internet through a separate modem
it never worked even with downloaded instruction materials from netgear website and a couple of phone calls and emails from tech staff who sincerely tried to help
finally boxed the unit and sent back to netgear
no response from netgear since sendingive owned this product for about a year now and felt compelled to write a review because of how frustrated i am with this product
i have att dsl and apparently the att dsl router has the same ip address as the netgear router
it took several phone calls between netgear and att but finally this problem was resolved by designating specific dns addresses to use  and 
setup otherwise was relatively easy and the router worked though it would intermittently not work and i would have to reset the router unplug it and plug it back in
at first it would work for a few days but now the router has to be reset at least once a day and its getting really annoying because the router is in the basement and my office is upstairs
ive already updated the firmware on this router and confirmed that the problem seems to be with the router rather than my dsl modem
anyway netgear support was fairly responsive over email but they wanted me to adjust mtus or packet sizes or something until the problem went away at this point what they were telling me to do was beyond my understanding and the support people were only interested in telling me what to do rather than explaining what they thought was the problem
at this point ive had it with the router and im looking for a new one that just plain workshere are a few thoughts i had after wrestling with this junk for minmaybe the smartwizard should be called the dumbwizard
updating settings takes an insane amount of time much more so than similar products from dlink and linksys
when i first found that no manual was in the box i thought to myself oh i see netgear is trying to save money by not printing the manual
i later found out that the manual is not even on the cd  you have to connect to the internet to get to it
in the setup wizard i was first prompted to set up an internet connection before using the router
well isnt the point of this to get an internet connectionnetgear put an obnoxious red label over the lan ports telling me to stop and use the installation cd
now i have sticker residue all over the back
using the cd probably made things even worse than if i would have manually set it up from the get gotheres no information in the box that tells me what the routers ip address is and the password
reading the manual it wants me to go to routerloginnet to log in a shameful cover up for  which i found out is the ip addygrrrr
im trying to configure the router right now and i have to wait for the updating settings even more
this is extremely slooowthe ultimate test of a router  if fresh out of the box i plug a dsl modem and another computer into it do i get internet
this router fails the testnow i see the setup wizard
i wonder if that helps
detecting connection type on internet port just runs over and over and over but now it says i have a static ip
grrr it says to powercycle the modem if thats the case so ill do thathappy happy happy i am connected to the internet but im still plugged directly into my dsl modem now lets trying plugging everything into the router and go from therewhat is this madness
the internet light is still amber
and what
only one computer can access the router at a time
now i cant even access the routerwell after an hour of fiddling around with configuration settings this router is going back to the store
it definitely takes the cake for being the absolute dumbest router i have ever worked with everything is automated and wizard infested
there is little hope for manually controlling this router it has assumed from the outset that i user am dumb illiterate and know absolutely nothing about computersi had an older rpv that was sacrificed to the lightning gods
i replaced it with a new rpvafter much trouble caused by their idiotic choice of  as a base address  where the normal default and previous default were   i got everything working again  as  this pos router drops all lan side connections anywhere from once a day to once every ten minutes
the only thing that fixed it is a power cycle on the routerthe indians at tech support are worthless
all they want to do is blame it on mcaffee  even after i told them mcaffee is disabled for testing then the idiot helpdesker told me he wants me to boot all the machines in safe mode with networking and watch them for several days to see if it fails unreal
he claims this will disable mcaffee  it does not
also of course safe mode leaves you in  x  video mode  he did not understand this 
i will purely be damned if im goign to spsend a day or more with my machines at  x  while i watch them to see fi the router fs up 
never buy netgear products again this product comes with a cd called resource cd version 
the following words are printed on the cd packagesetup for apple mac and linux users and then insert the cd open indexhtm and chose your language
click mac installation guide for mac users and setup manual for all others
however there is no mac installation guide
i called netgear technical support and was told that i had to download a firmware update from the netgear website and then download it to the router
i looked at the pagethe netgear technical support person refused to answer my question as to why the information printed on the resource cd packaging was incorrect
the netgear technical support person also seemed to have no idea what an imac was or that an imac does not have a microsoft operating system
after looking at the firmware update page i tried calling netgear technical support again to ask some questions about the firmware update process but i got tired of waiting after around ten minutesi hung up and printed out the amazon return labels
this is the first time that i have ever returned anything to amazon and the last time that i am buying a netgear producti have tried for the last  months to get netgear to resolve a problem with the rp that i have but to no avail
the unit quits working randomly and requires power cycling it to get it to work again
every response has been inane either netgear doesnt have a clue doesnt know how to find the problem or simply doesnt care
and the problem has nothing to do with loads as it occurs with one computer on the network
ive also run every type of scan of my computer to be sure it is not a virus etc and my computer is clean so the problem is with the router
i have a very simple system so the problem is not in the configuration
now netgear will not even respond to my support request email they now required me to register and log the case in as new
i strongly suggest going with linksys and that is what i am switching to
this has to be one of the worst customer service experiences ive hadthe netgear fvsv may seem like a great option for users with the need for many ports but beware
the fvsv loses connectivity too often
every few minutes it seems like i must reset the router switch off switch on to get it working againi would not recommend this router because it has one too many connectivity issuesother than that the router is great
port forwarding seems pretty straightforwardso to summarize dont purchase this router unless you have around  to wastedont buy itits not worth the troubledont say i didnt warn youi had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the fvs
the main reason is the speed
i have a lab and we tested the max internet throughput of the fvss at mbps
this is unacceptable
oh yes this is with the latest firmwareseveral calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem
i contacted their legal deptartment the same day
several promises were made on netgears part wich resulted in them having another level  tech call me again to insist i reinstall my osi have successfully sued to get my money backwith all of my venting done i would like to say that i am still a fan of the prosafe line and will continue to use it
but netgear be warned i will be all over you until you get this product line properly supportedthis thing works okay as a hubswitch but i cant connect to my isp through the external modem
i was deceived by the product description because it guaranteed this device could handle analog phone service which is all i have
therefore i bought this product under the pretense of false advertising and im stuck with a gadget that doesnt work
at least i bought it before the price went up 
now i have to have a network guru come in and see if there is any hope of salvaging my investmentthis was a decent unit when it was new
i used one for years but when comcast got above  meg now  this could not perform above   dont buy if you have more than  meg as this will be the weak link in your chain
i upgraded to the fvsg  years ago and that is a big improvement but limited to  meg
its time for a new upgradestill a beta box if you get much beyond a basic configuration this box is not for you
running the latest firmware  the box crashed several times and had to be initialized
netgears technical support states that this box cannot be used a just a vpn server it must also be used as the network gateway in order for the vpns to work
entirely not acceptablei have this switch behind a dsl modem
since dsl speed is only mbs the  speed is plenty
the unit is nice looking and running coolhowever it suddently stopped sending traffic through it today even all the lights are working fine
i powered down all the computers and reboot dsl modem many times could not find anything wrong  until i replaced this switch with another onei dont know what was wrong with it
all lights work fine
when a cable plugged in the ports lighting up fine
but no traffic passing through
i was hoping if it died at least the light also off so that i could know it is this switchs faulthorrible product
i quotupgradedquot from my netgear rp to this product so i could ditch my software firewall
well i wish i hadnt
i get constant lockups and dropped connections on both wan and lan
noticeably slower web access compared to the rp it replaced although ill chalk this up to a true spi firewall
finally after years of good tech
support from netgear i had the added bonus of talking with a tech
who didnt have the slightest clue about the specs of this router
she spent nearly half an hour insisting that my router had a quotcheckquot light indicated by a check mark shaped led
i kept arguing that my router had no such light although another popular netgear router does
furthermore her official answer to everything was quotjust rebootquot
i felt like i was stuck in a reallife episode of dilbert
anyway numerous updates countless resets full and partial and a mountain of frustration later im ditching this paperweight and going in another direction
save yourself the time money and aggravation and avoid this puppy at all coststhis is one of netgears newest and worst models
its ability to configure rules leaves much to be desired
although advertising states otherwise their technical department are at a loss for words or answers
which brings to fact a second point
this particular model is pretty much without knowledgable netgear technical helpso if its your ambition to find out quotwhat came first the chicken or the eggquot  this router is up your ally
cause youll discover the answere to the chicken riddle before you can figure rules out for this router that will work consistantlyi have had two of these routers both of which have failed shortly after the warranty expired
i kept the router on  but for some reason if the router gets unplugged from the power outlet it is difficult and finally impossible to get the router to come back up after plugging back in after the warranty expired no less
the test light stays on continously now on both routers
no amount of resettingunplugging has brought them out of the test mode
im guessing that they are using poor quality components to keep the price so cheap
i also use a very expensive line conditioner that it iswas plugged into to no avail
will be looking at a sonicwall device for a replacementive upgraded the firmware backwards and forwards but this puppy drops connections like my old switch never does
everything seems to work fine but then a larger download and it consistently doesnt complete
ive changed the mtu size and that seems to have an effect but its still erratic and wont complete downloads
i switch back the to switch and no problem
im using it in wired mode so its not a wifi issuei ordered a sandisk flash card  received a brand that would not work in my embroidery machine
i store all of my embroidery designs on flash cards  the computer in my machine only excepts certain brands of flash cards
i can only store  designs on each card because thats all that my machine will recognize
when i order sandisk in the future this is what i wantthis adapter is slower than my canon rebel xt
i measured about  mbsec with the sandisk ultra ii  gb card  close to the speed of usb  do not waste your moneyi dont know why these types of cards are still on the marketthey are old slow and obsolete
instead search for bit cardbus adapters such as the ones made by viking delkin or lexar which are many times faster but not much more expensive
and they fit in the same pc card slot on most laptops made in the last decade
the bit cards i have used are even a bit faster than usb  and firewireyou can spot bit cards by the gold strip at the top of the card
no gold strip
then prepare to wait an hour or more for your data to transfer while your laptop is brought to its knees
the old silver cards may be fine for storing and playing mps or may be needed for laptops made more than  years ago but any large amount of datasuch as gbs of photos or video will take quite a while to copy over
why would you want a reader that is slower than your flash mediaabout  months after i started using my sandisk card in my canon camera i started to get memory error problems
i reformatted the card in the camera and that got things working for a few more months
now reformatting using the camera doesnt worki called sandisk customer support and they told me i need to reformat using a card reader
then they told me i am supposed to reformat the card twice a month using a card readder
when i told them i dont have one they told me to go buy one or go visit a local staples or office depot and try to use theirs
are these guys kidding
reformat twice a month
walk into a store and ask the sales guy if i can borrow the use of a card reader
no waywhen i insisted that sandisk replace the card they reluctantly agreed to do so and even then they said they would only replace the card this once since i failed to follow the standard procedure of using a card reader to reformat the card
all this over a  card
it would have be so much easier for them to simply offer to replace the card at the outset without all the attitude
im never buying sandisk againi bought one of these when i bought my canon s less than two months ago
the card has rolled over and died on me
i went to the retailer and they said that the defect is a manufacturer issue
we went to the packaging for warranty details and there is no warranty listed on the packaging other that it is warranted to work fit in compactflash cameras
the brand of card next to it on the shelf kodak had a  year warranty for functionalitynextime is kodak for mei bought this card reader to use with my laptop so i wouldnt have a usb reader hang off the side just waiting to get broken off
to my disappointment this reader is incredibly slow
slow enough to make it not worth the money no matter how little it costsheres some specs on my analysis test was performed with a dell latitude d w intel coreduo laptop memory card used was a sandisk extreme iii gb compact flash transfer of thirtysix   megapixel images mb each total size of mb from d to extreme iii cf card via pcmcia the transfer took approx  minutes from extreme iii cf card to d via pcmcia the transfer took approx  minutes from d to extreme iii cf card via generic usb  reader the transfer took approx  seconds from extreme iii cf card to d via generic usb  reader the transfer took approx  secondsjust consider this was only  photos mb total
if i travel with my laptop and take hundred or thousands of photos and needs to backup or download them i would most definitely need to bring my power supply
and when you travel bringing more stuff to weigh you down is the last thing you want to doso with results like these its clear why im in the process of returning this item
i hope you all think twice before ordering this readeri bought this item hoping that it would work in the pc card slot in my civic but when i popped it in and pressed the card tab it would not read from the device
i checked the card reader and media both in a laptop prior to using it in my car so i knew that the media and adapter both work
i believe that honda uses a type i card slot instead of a type ii card this adapter is type iiso if you are thinking of getting this for your car youd be better served getting thesandisk sdada cf to pc card adapter which is specifically mentioned in comments as working whonda
now i am just hoping that the new card that i bought will be able to address a gb cf cardi have had these speakers for a little over a year
they are the worst set of computer speakers i have ever owned periodfirst impressions where that they had really tinny thin sound to them
like louder laptop speakers not good at allmaximum volume is also not very high and they start cracking at anything above half volumenow after a year something has failed so that only one of the speakers worksyou get what you pay for but there are better cheap computer speakers out there for the same or lower pricedo not buyfirst let me state that for low priced computer speakers under  cyber acoustics is the best out there and cannot be touched
usually you get three to four times your money when you buy their products and i cannot say enough good things about themthat said these are absolutely atrocious
i could write a long review justifying why but simply put these speakers if you can call them that are horrible but lets just say they have no quality at any end whatsoever
dont bother with the eq they just suck and are not worth looking at any furtherif you want a much better speaker that is comparable in size and price checkout these carb amplified computer speaker system cyber acousticsif you want to go a step up in price and get superior sound and volume checkout these cyber acoustics  pc subwoofersatellite system cai own both and can recommend either in good conscience although i like the latter much better than any computer speakers i have ever ownedboth are currently available from amazonwhatever you do stay clear of thesethey are pure junkthe speakers work good
but then you plug in your headphones and the volume drops way down
you have to have the volume all the way up to use headphones and then if you unplug them look out
crazy loudi intend to replace them with some speakers that shound good quite soonpure crap
to think the  i spent    sh plus another sawbuck could have purchased a case of pbr in cansim not the type of person who is picky about sound quality so i figured it wouldnt matter if i got cheap speakers
boy was i wrong
these buzz and arent even worth listening to
their best feature is the blue led power light
youd be better off plugging a pair of cheap dollar headphones into the back of your computer
youve been warned
i wish someone had told methese are horrible speakers nothing but static no matter where they are placed
i needed speaker for a week or two until i moved and these are useless
i will be throwing them away and going withoutjeffdont buy these speakers despite the attractive price if you plan on using a cell phone anywhere near them
the interference is soo horrible it makes this painfully loud and anoying buzzingpopping noise because they are not properly shielded by cell phone interferenceim mad that i got stuck with them but im going to buy a more expensive pair next time
definetly learned my lessoni purchased  pairs for an office to be shared by  people myself and  others
the only criteria was cheap headphone jack and decent looking and these fit the bill exceptlike others here the usb power method seemed like a good idea to save plug usage
it may be a good idea but as some others have noted the implementation of the idea is fatally flawedtheres a huge amount of noise using headphones and a ghz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers offvery disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite  with no packagingthese speakers appeared to be a good basic pair of speakers for those who want a nofrills inexpensive system
they look pretty nice admittedly
power is drawn through a usb port which is a nice idea  no bulky transformer
and herein lies the problempower from the usb port needs to be filtered on these speakers it is definitely not
they hiss crack and transmitamplify every electronic interference signal that comes out of your pc
move your mouse and you hear clicking
cdrom usage is even worse
the noise renders the speakers unusable for even the most patient among usfor the price theyre not even worth the effort to return ship them
these are totally unusuable and going straight into the trashwhen i bought these speakers i was very very pleased with the quality of sound and the sleak design
unfortunately after about three months i started getting distortion even at very low volume levels
i talked to a speaker salesman that said i probably just got some lemons
a contributing problem is that i cannot get in touch with monsoon
their site is down  and their new site has been quotcoming soonquot for several weeks now  now i am stuck with once awesome but now terrible sounding speakerthis product is a great idea however the execution is very poorthe idea is that the irock can broadcast the audio from any device that has a headphone jack such as your discman walkman or ipod on one of four fm frequencies      or  for a short distance a few feet which should be plenty to reach your radio antenna from inside your car
since fm fidelity typically exceeds that of cassette it should be better for your car than a cassette adapterthe irock does not live up to its promise
at least in the area where i live los angeles there are stations occupying all four of the frequencies that the irock uses
i wont go into the physics of it all but basically a low powered fm broadcast at extremily short range should completely overpower an fm signal from a powerful radio station miles away
in fact a friend of mine once assembled a small fm transmitter from a kit very similar to the irock using a v battery that did exactly thatunfortunately the irocks signal is not sufficiently strong to reliably overpower another radio station
the sound quality varies wildly depending on conditions and even moving the irock a few inches or changing its orientation a small bit can dramatically impact the audio quality
often in my car i hear the other radio station underneath or even over the music im trying to broadcast from the irockin the end buying a car cassette adapter is a much better use of anyones money
it might not offer quite the same level of fidelity as fm but at least you will hear your music clearly and consistentlyi bought this at the apple store when i got my ipod major selling point of ipod is to connect it to car stereo
but it only had four preset stations that would never come in and faded out quickly if you were ever able to get a signal
i suggest you find the transpod if you want the best in fm signal transmitting
i currently have the sf and it is a nice option
in the end i will probably have to get a better stereo for a direct plugin for the mp playersthis product is a waste of time and money
the sound quality is worse than am radio
if your looking for sound quality dont buy this product
lot of static and interference no matter what frequency you set it to
it does not live up to its advertised claimsthe description for this item as of  is incorrect according to promise technologys web site which i really should have checked before i ordered this card and tried to install it this card only functions as a pci to ata  channel controller it has no raid functionality whatsoever
the descrptions of raid functions seem to be describing the promise technology fasttrack tx card
ive notified amazon about this error and if they change the description thus saving others from the aggrivation i had then kindly ignore this reviewthis is a known fault of this controller that it does not work with optical drives
it only works with hard drives and promise doesnt let people know this ahead of timejunk
stay awaythis is great if all of electrical devices you are connecting to it are lamps or some other device with a similarly narrow plug
this is supposed to be a  outlet surge protector yet the outlets are so cramped together that i can only use  outletsrecently our home was hit with a powerful electrical surge  whether it was from lightning or from a transient power surge we cant say for certain we suspect lightning
three out of four belkin surge suppressors were fried and failed to protect the attached devices including a new  samsung lcd tv and a canon fax machine
the surge cube suppressor i am reviewing here actually melted the plastic bubbled from heat
other units evidenced actual brown burnt singe marks
based on this experience we are switching back to tripplite isobar
as for belkins  warranty go online and check out what you must do and the costs you must expend to seek reimbursement for damage
plan on spending lots of time and money at the post office or upswhatever suppressor you choose opt for the most joules protection and fastest clamping speed you can afford
if your device is worth protecting spending a bit more on the surge suppressor is cheap insurancei bought this protector about a year ago about one month before i bought my  projector
i thought about protection before i purchased my projector because it was very important i didnt lose what i spent my hard earned money
the warranty claim of belkin and great reviews were hard to pass upand a hard lesson that words on a piece of paper do not mean muchthe storyone night i was watching tv on my projector when a storm rolled in and lightning struck near by
the lights in the room went out then back on within a second
the audio through my receiver was still playing along with the dvr all of which was on a separate surge protector
the projector however never came back on it was dead the surge protector was still onboth lights still going as if nothing happened
in my home i have  tvs  computers  av receivers and several more expensive electrical components on multioutlet surge protectorsnothing was touched except for the projector on this dedicated singleoutlet surge protectorthe claim to belkin was sent in within the  days required along with the surge protector still working the purchase receipt of both the protector and projector to show the sole purpose of the purchase was for just such an occasion
also sent to them was the professional repair diagnosis and repair estimate  parts alone the power supply was dead as well as the main circuit board
this was also proof the damage occurred through the outlet and not some magical event
belkin ran their tests and simulated minor surges and found no issues and therefore were not liable
they even sent back the exact protector so i could continue to use itvery thoughtfullong story short dont ever expect to make a claim with belkin and receive compensation for a failure to protect your equipment
there is no honor in this company and i will never buy belkin again
i have never had a failure before and i hope no one has to go through such an expensive trial and error as i havenot only is this unnecessarily large my fault for not checking the dimensions but my  prong plug wont fit into it
the grounding hole seems to be in the wrong place i am in america and the same plug fits my  outlet belkin surge just fine
weirdly the packaging says good for modems etc
 but there is no way to plug one inin all my plan to have a small surge protector in places i need them is scrapped
even if i could connect this is big bulky and ugly
not worth the postage to returnthese things are cheaply made and do not last long
we bought two and have already thrown them away as they failedi installed this on a duplex outlet to protect my microwave and toaster both with electronic controls
i noticed that this only has a single prong
the first time i tried to use both devices together it failed
ive looked for an amp rating but can not find onenannormally i love belkin products but this one didnt measure up
after  weeks of usage it completely stopped working
i tried it in other outlets but no luck
it might have something to do with the switch thing that another review mentioned
im not too knowledgeable about outlets but my other power surge protectors all work great
i recommend trying a different producti bought this to protect my sump pump and one day i want down into my basement to find that my breaker had blown and so i went to my panel and flipped the power back on and immediate pop off so i went to the pump because its a dedicated outlet i pulled the surgemaster out to find out that the thing had arched and now smelled like burning plastic so i riped this piece of crap out and plugged the pump in directly and no problem this thing is  china crapthis is the item made in china and only last for two weeks
i would  not buy again or recommend to a friendi bought  of these for the kitchen and bathroomone of the outlets died after  weeks
the unit normally has a green light and the light went out
could not get any power through the outlets
no reset button
only good news is its less than  days so i could ship it back to amazon for a refundi have a dozen of surge protectors some of which have lasted for years
this is the first time i have had a surge protector croak on me
i bought this for the price and the belkin brand and expect better reliabilityedit now one of the other protectors has also died after  months of use
unit no longer lights up or provides power and im outside of the  day return window
manufacturer warranty is meaningless when the shipping cost is as much as the price of a new one
piece of junkedit  after looking at other wall surge protectors nearly all of them are made so they become useless as soon as it trips
unlike larger surge protectors where you can reset them with a push of a button these smaller protectors only work once
i would not use this for hair dryers portable heaters or other high wattage items
you are better off buying a wall tapon the back of the package the ul clamping voltage is listed as v
the package says that for sensitive electronics you should get a clamping voltage rating of v or lower
so the package is telling you that this product is not a good choice for sensitive electronicsi changed most of my outlets to the modern decora type lowes aspirescrew feature is worthless for these outletsi planned on using these on the old fashioned outlets that i left in
i figured they would cover the plate and i wouldnt need to update those plugs
wrong
the plug in feature is near the very top of the belkin
that means they leave a prominent part of the upper part of the old ivory plate showing
remove the plate and you have unfinished drywall showing  the cutout
you wouldnt know that by looking at the given size specs for the belkin
why dont these cover the entire platei opened one package and will return the other threekeep in mind the only reason im replacing my existing  prong surge protector is to provide a screw anchor
my old one keeps falling out
so my outlets dont have any ground faults or problems
this is a relatively new mid s home in the us built to code
my current load on the outlet is low
w at most
i plugged in this brand new belkin and poof
one of the sockets caught fire shorted and blew my breaker
this may be the worlds fasted surge protector failure
i have to surmise that the engineering behind this device does not exist
fail
avoidthis thing randomly stopped working after a few weeks of perfectly fine useprior to that the only problem i had was that it takes up too much space
although it has prongs for only one socket you cant put it in the bottom socket and have the top socket free for example
also the fact that it uses one socket and has six ports drawing energy from that one socket probably contributed to its completely conking outinstalled it in two older towers
did not work in a toweramd chip with windows  installed driver from disk
did not work in an older dell server intel chip and mo board with pcbsd  oscouldnt get it to work my pc never would boot with it pluged in
pass on this im glad im only out five bucksi used to use this cord when i first got the calculator and it was a godsend so since i lost it and am taking applied calculus ii i thought i could definitely benefit from it again
however after receiving it and wasting a few hours trying to make it work i contacted texas instruments and they told me that the cord does not work with mac os x  and above or windows  so unless you buy an old operating system this cord will not work with any new computer made within the last year
i was kind of disappointed that ti cares that little about their calculator customers and wish there was another brand that could keep up with ti but sadly they seem to have the monopoly what a waste of money
the clam shells would not stay close
i ended up tossing the entire lot of them and went back to the old school jewel casesmy daughter purchased this player
it works with the included software and the base memory only
they have a bug in their sd support and windows xp does not allow you to actually use the card
i didnt know this when i purchased a  sd card to provide additional storage
also this uses musicmatch which insists on upgrading itself from the from the version included with the player
if you perform the upgrade the software doesnt work properly with the player yesi installed the new plugin
all in all this is clearly a device built by a company that doesnt know how to interface to windows and it has caused plenty of grief in our housei loaded the software musicmatch and its difficult to navigate through
took me  hours to initially load the music as you need to copy the cd tracks to a folder then to the mp player
i tried to use it on my laptop which has an upgrade and it cant find the player so now i cant load anything to the player
i tried to contact rca but there is no support for the basic software package
you need musicmatch to interface with the player and if it cant find it then its money down the drain
get an ipod its alot easier as my friend demonstrated and face it spending  hours to get this thing to work plus the aggravation is worth the ease of an ipod just plug and loadi wish rca wouldnt use me as a beta tester and then not provide support unless i pay  for it
the radio presets are also a pain to use
mines going in the trashwe have used logitech cordless desktops for years and i tried a microsoft combo because of a great deal
i have now tried two microoft cordless keyboardmouse systems and can attest buy a logitechthe feel and construction of the hardware is inexpensive
keys are loose and floppy
the mouse feels like soviet plasticthe software is lame too
stupidly simple things like battery condition are not available under mouse or keyborad properties
the last straw was using a simple combination of keyboard and mouse click like shift  click was not possible in windows explorer
maddeningand dont look for support online
microsoft is typically a frustrating experience to find support
its actually worsebuy only compact flash compatible productsafter your camera dies your memory will live on with other compact flash productsi could not agree more on the issue brought up here
as if there were not already enough memory formats yet another one
it seems to be about either desperate or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever
why cant we just have one or two formats of memory
this is as bad as it would be to have  formats of cdrom drives

we cant afford to buy special memory for each and every device
if you buy fujilympus i sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xd

yall are just hatin on a prophetfuji and olympus have found a new way to make money and rip off innocent consumers
a new card format called xd card
a cool way to ensure royalties and extra cashif you have already bought a xd card based camera you are left with no choice right 
so go ahead and buy this card it works fine with fuji camerasbtw if you havent bought your camera till now think twice before getting a fuji
the xd card costs  times the cost of simlar sized cf card as of this writing
and xd cards are useless outside of fujiolympus cameras
compare that to the versatality of cf cards at much lower priceoh and fuji cant seem to manufacture enough quantity if these as of now out of stock at most places 
very bad fuji switch to cfsd or watch you camera sales plummet
todays consumer isnt a fool he can read reviews on amazon before buying stuffit works fine eaven with a compact flash adapter and a pcmica notebook so you only need one wireless card for both pocketpc and laptop but one weak after i boughtit it dies it dosent work any more
im angry because i live in mexico and i cant use the waranty
bad choicejust to echo the concerns about a serious problem with wcf it doesnt really work with pocketpc   yes there is a beta driver but its been in the beta stage for months with no update in sightso look for a cf card that you know to be supported by pocketpc after much research  i took the plunge  and plucked down money for this thing
what a mistake 
musicmatch software syncing to ipod was awful  with dropouts  and transfers in which you had no idea whether the songs were transferring or not
there is no visble indicator of song transfer 
then i tried ephpod after reading some reviews  it just caused xp to freeze
believe me i put computers together as a hobby  and this thing was a big mistake
dont spend your money 
poor software  too expensive  even with the gb 
im returning mine  last apple i ever own i loved my ipod for however long the battery lasted but as i began charging it and leaving it until my next use it began depleting its own battery without any use
it has now been  weeks and my ipod holds a full charge for about an hour with out turning it on
my only choice is to return my ipod to apple and they want money
even though it is still in the warrenty
i highly recommend opting for another mp player as this one costs more than mosts offers great everything but battery
if you always have a plug within  feet of you you might not have this problem but for most of us the point of this is to take us away from plugs and computersi bought one of the windows ipods when they first came out and have had nothing but trouble with the software for downloading music and books audible
music and books would have gaps or be completly unplayable
i would advise looking at the user comments on apples own web site before buying one of thesei bought the ipod from amazon and it was delivered about a week ago
i also bought the apple care protection plan
the product seems to work fine except i am having minor but irksom problems navigating using the buttons and wheel thing
i am using it for an audible book which is supposed to start where you left off
well after  hours it decided to start at beginning again
i try fast forward and the thing goes to the next book
i want to just finish the last hour of the one that is being playedso i call what they call customer service and find that they wont give me any advice whatever until i fax in a copy of my shipping document from amazon and another sheet with a magic number on it from within the extended service package
they say that amazon is not an authorized reseller and that they cannot check my order and date of sale from amazoni explain that i do not have a fax machine and that i will go send the stuff in a few days when i feel like walking that far using my crutchesi think that it is probably a good product but if you are in any way handicapped and it is not convenient for you to run around to get their service i recommend not buying itwhere is the fm tuner
microphone
tivo like buffered fm radio
how about a replaceable batteryfor this price id expect a full feature setdo yourself a favor and limit your camera search to those that use the industry standard memory format compact flashit was a nice camera until it stopped working in the first week of my three week paris france trip
it was working fine i took couple of pictures and turned it off and then it never turned back on
also from other reviews you will see the same engineering mistake
there is a small screw coming out and shorting the circuits and power
i called fuji they told me to send it to a repair center and the cost of repair is same as the camera itself now i wont get it fixed or buy any other fuji product again
this is a common problem that they had with their design in this particular model and they should fix it with no cost at me
if a car has such a common problem they recall it and fix the problem for you with no cost but for cameras you pay  dollars it is some money maybe not same as cars but why do we measure respect with money and they dont respect their customers then ok they wont have loyal customers either
never trust fuji go buy a better camera from sony or canoni was previously very interested in this camera
however after using it for a time it has been very possibly a nearly useless camera
the autofocus is poor at best the movie is only x max and less than fpsthere is also a considerable delay in taking pictures as the autofocus has a meeting someplace inside the camera to discuss if there is any point in focusing on anything in particularthere are many better choices not to mention the finepix si purchased a fuji  last year because it seemed like great value for money
like many things that seem too good to be true it was
almost exactly a year after purchase in which it was used sparingly the camera went dead  it just would not turn on
by the time i got it to a repair center the  year warranty period was over
the estimated repair cost including tax is   i can get a decent new  mp camera for that price these dayswhile it lasted it took decent photos
the x zoom which was a big selling point of the camera was fairly useful
focusing in low light was difficult
overall it felt too light and plasticky
with the breakdown ill never buy a fuji againcouldnt get my computer to recognize the digital camera so had to send it back
could not get any help to try and resolve the problemthis is binocular melded with a very low end submegapixel digital camerai cant even rate the optical portion high because it was very uncomfortable to use
the spacing and spacing adjustments between the barrels are awkward
my nose has to rest on the usb port entry to be able to see into the lensesthe camera automatically shuts off in less than  seconds sometimes not enough time to line up a shot
when the shutter engages it beeps once but it beeps twice more before shut off forcing me to look at the camera to ensure i didnt hit the shutter againthe worst part is my x digital camera opticals gets a tighter closeup than the binocularlogitech keyboard issueon nov i called logitech at  to arrange for an rma
they said no need to send the broken unit back they would send a replacement keyboard out within  hours
they assigned case xxxxxx and rma xxxxxxon nov spoke to a nice personname witheld who was pleasant and polite
i told her that the good news was that i just received the replacement keyboard the bad news is that it is the wrong one
it is a media model which is a lower model than the elite that i purchased
i pointed out that this model is missing  key features the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top the  main reasons for which i bought the elite modelshe put me on hold and when she came back she proceeded to try to convince me that the model they sent me was an upgrade from the elite
i explained to her that her assertion was incorrect and the media model was clearly an inferior model
i pointed out that on neweggcom the media sells for  while the elite sells for 
i again pointed out that this model is missing  key features the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top the  main reasons for which i bought the elite modelshe put me on hold several times during the call which by the way lasted for  minutes
each time she came back she continued to try to sell the idea that i was getting an upgrade
i was patient for the first  minutes of this but im not a saint and finally stopped her
i told her that i was an engineer a very technical and computer savvy person and that no one any where would consider what they did an upgrade
i told her that i didnt appreciate being treated this way
and requested to speak to a supervisorat that point she admitted that the media model was missing features and that she understood my concerns
she then said that they had no more elite models and thats why they sent the media model
i suggested they get one from one of their vendors like neweggcom she said i would have to buy it from them directly and they had no way of compensating me for that
she then said that the elites were no longer being manufactured
what should i believe here
so in the end they did not comply with the terms of their own warranty
when i pointed that out she said that they did by sending me the inferior keyboardhow ridiculous is this
i was appalled
if it didnt happed to me i would have doubted  that it really happened
finally i asked if she was going to comply with my earlier request to speak to a supervisor
she said yes and went on hold yet againshe came back and we waited for another  or so minutes for the supervisor todd who never answered
she then asked if she could have him call me back in a few minutes and confirmed my phone numberwhat nonsense
i have never seen a company tell such bold falsehoods to avoid fulfilling its warranty commitments especially considering that this was all for a lousy  product
wouldnt it have been easier to just make the customer happy and handle this
they won the battle but ill win the war by never buying another logitech product again and i urge all of you who read this sad tale to also avoid buying from themthe supervisor never called
run dont walk away from these guysif you are looking into buy this cameradont
get the sony hdrau highdef camera its x times betternewersame price and highdefif you buy the gl you will get the remove the cassette warning after about a year of useive used this camera for  years
last year i started getting intermittant remove the cassette messages
i wish i had captured the outstanding three recorded tapes onto my pc then
instead i recorded another  minutes
now the error message is solid no matter which tape i usemy experience with canon in the past has taught me not to waste the time or the money to bother having this repaired
i spent about  having my previous canon camcorder repaired
it worked a few weeks and died again each time
having gone to the web to research this bug im convinced fixing this one will be an expensive and time consuming exercise in futility
 weeks plus turn around
and canon wont tell how much the average repair cost is
check the web   lesson learned
ill be shopping a different manufacturer
sony
jvc
never again canonnot worth the money
i actually receive more hdtv channels with a cheap plainold uhf antenna
this is simply junk  dont waste your moneyi bought this product because i read rave reviews about it
however it does not work in san jose and i live on a top floor
after being able to pick up zero channels i bought an rca ant for the same price and was able to get all the channelsi live in north orange county and i found that even after searching for a sweet spot for hdtvthis antenna picked up a grand total of zero channels on a onkyo medium highend receiver
if you live in orange county dont waste your money on this
btw this antenna is not amplified
i am going to pursue amplified antennas nextthe attic is tough for me since i have a twostory home and wiring from the attic to the downstairs denwould be significant
this antenna is identical to the philips antenna just branded with a different moniker
not recommendedthis product is fragile and completely ineffective
i bought two and both fell apart within months after no more stress than simply moving them around
not only were they fragile but they barely work at all
there was little difference in the quality of the signal received with the antenna than without it
simple cheaper rabbit ears worked much better
this product is a complete waste of money
i have rarely been this dissatisfied with a purchase
i wish i could give it zero starsmy cable modem supports speeds of up to mbpstypically about mbps download and up to mbps uploadtypically mbps
i have a gigabit switch on the other side for my home lani picked one of these up because of the linksys warranty
i never got to use that warranty because my first one failed within two weeks of heavy use and the second one a replacement began to fail in a week
i was able to return both devices to staples for an exchange and then a full refundto be fair i push a massive crazy amount of data through each of these two units
i dont know whether the parts began to overheat and fail but i found myself reseting the device once a day and a few days later it was  not working when i got up in the morning wasting much of my time
and finally i needed to reset it three to five times in the span of an hour or twoi pulled them offline when it got this badas these were new units i did not update the firmware
my feeling is these have been out a long time and the firmware should have been up to date without my fussing with itthese units might be ok if you dont need to download or upload a lot of data
if you are a power user they just dont cut it
on the other hand why should you have to reset it
a good router never failsalso i noticed my download speeds were poor
my hunch is there is a bandwidth limit to the device that is far below that of cable modem speedsso the bottom line is this
it is a cheap unit required reseting frequently and probablyalmost certainly has limited bandwidth
so it is clear this is one to avoida final hint if a router had several gigabit lan ports it will have higher bandwidthi used this router for  years with firmware  and vpn on all the time
i just updated to firmware  thinking it would help with windows networking netbios which never worked well through vpn and its now useless
it will not respond to hard resets or pingsthier support site really sucks too
its out of date and incompletewhile attempting a firmware upgrade of befsx from version  with file befsxvcodebin using  following instructions in the linksys online help system answer id  results in warning 
upgrade file pattern error
phone support did provide a work aroundanswer from phone support download the upgrade utility from the befsrv other router downloads page and use it to upgrade the bin file to this router
the v upgrade untility on the router itself is defective they saycompletly unusable after install completes and router reboot as abovend call  went through all the troubleshooting and ended with you need a new router because you may have installed the wrong firmware and the router is past its one year warrenty
two breaks to the supervisor did not help with getting a replacement router or rmai think any router will due now
i thought linksys had the best reputation and products
but i think it matters no longer
check prices and reviews then decide
dont depend on name brand anymorethis router would be no stars if possible
i just spent two hours trying every trick mentioned on dslreportscom to get this working with no success
flashing to previous and newer firmware had no effect
i spoke with a clec tech on the other end of the connection who reported fragmented packet errors
swapping out the router resolved the issue
we were using sbc dsl speedstream  connection hardware known good i didnt have another brand on hand to check harware compatability
id highly recommend another routerdont venture down this pathregardsjeffsearch  for befsx and see what i meanprimary use of this device is as a vpn endpoint
however vpn very unstable and many features dont work
so bewarei got this router when out company switched to vpn for remote desktop connections to increase security
this is one of the worst routers i have ever used and i returned it to amazon after about a week
the longest uptime i have ever seen was about  hours
their support was horrible and told me that they would not support the product at all if i upgraded the firmware from their website
i have since switched to netgear vpn routers and those have been up for about  years now
i used to recommend linksys but now i tell people to stay away or carefully check the model and version number and compare them to the reviews and unfortunately the firmware sucks
google befsx firmware upgrade problems and see what you get
i had mine running a stable but vulnerable firmware and decided to download the latest firmware from linksys site to close the security hole
unfortunately it wasnt until numerous problems began router reboots disconnects no internet connection that i checked for firmware issues and found problems via google
there are no warnings on that linksys download site
they are essentially providing software to break your product
it got so bad i couldnt connect to the internet anymore
i had to go to work to download an older firmware unfortunately linksys does not provide these
from dslreports
they fixed most of my problems but there is a list of bugs that still have not been fixed
fortunately i dont use the features that trigger those bugs
im providing the link so that someone who has purchased it can upgrade their firmware at their discretion
otherwise i would say do not buy this product
its unnecessary headaches when other routers will work just as well
though i hear dlink products also have problemsi am not very technical when it comes to case fans but i do have ears these things are the loudest fans you can possibly meet
i have two in my case and everytime i turn it on i feel the need to put earplugs in my ears
if you play music o boy youre gonna have to play it really loud to overcome the loud loud loud fanpros moves lots of air it workscons loud loud loudi bought this card for my canon s as it was listed as one of the accessaries for that camera got lazy that day
weve taken no more than  shots when we started getting image slots marked as quotincompatible jpeg formatquot all overi went on the simpletech webpage
one cant just send an email to themone has to fill out a form and give out home phone etc and the faq which one has to dig for doesnt seem to have an answerive thrown out the package so i guess i cant return it
how annoyingi will never buy another simpletech product againi hate to write this
the tivo service is great
living without it is hard to imagine
but i have now had  tivo series s break in the last  months
this is an unacceptably high failure rate
and tivos returnexchange policies are weighted heavily against the consumer
the first time it cost  to replace with a refurbished unit
this time tivo wants  to replace again with a refurbished unit that only carries a  day warranty
both times the problem appears to be the hard drive  once the entire unit just went haywire
this time the unit downloads program data but fails to load it properly into the units database
after  hours worth of calls to tivo tech support both times the engineering department decided the unit had to be replaced
just a heads up to prospective buyers
i am going to purchase a rd party replacement drive at least it carries a  month warranty and keep my fingers crossed
good luck if you purchase one  i hope you have better lucki have  tivo units  hour and  hour that i have connected to my home network via wireless
i purchased  units thinking it was going to be the ultimate television experience and because there is no way to record  programs at once with one unit eg
 and frasier concurrentlythe positives using tivo to record programs is even easier than you will expect
playback with pause and rewind of live tv is great
once you get it set up doing things over the home network really makes it simplethe negatives if you have a cable box with digital audio output it digital audio will not work with tivo and neither will hdtv
also it does not include component video inputs or outputs so you are left to use inferior connections
from these perspectives buying tivo now assures you are buying a product that will shortly be obsolete
you will be disappointed in the quality of playback on hdtv and of the audio quality compared simply to just using a cable box or satellite with hdtv receiver
it is really behind the times on these areas
also their warranty and service is poor
there is only a day warranty on labor year parts and you must call a toll ie
not tollfree number and wait on hold for  minutes to get service
web support is nonexistent
one of our units was louder than the other from the day we bought them and has grown louder and louder to the point we needed to call for support
after initially refusing to service the unit unless i pay  for the service tivo  month past  month warranty window finally agreed to reduce the cost to  since their web site led us to believe the sound was normal when we first received the unit
unfortunately this fix will only guarantee that the replacement box will work for  days  after that i will need to pay full price to repair it if it has an issue
given that they are sending me a replacement unit ie
from a service inventory rather than repairing the one i own i have a feeling that there are far more issues with the boxes than people believe
it is not surprising since the units use a hard drive with a fan ie
with moving parts  not flash memory which run  x  overall i find product quality marginal at best and customer service to be exceptionally poor
it took a lot to get the service price reduced even though we firmly believe our unit was defective from day 
also dont be fooled by the capacity noted on the product
it only holds  hours of programming if you use the worst quality setting which most people would find unacceptable
a more realistic capacity is    of the quoted capacity which is what you will find if you use the  higher quality settingsfinally i am most disturbed by the reviews of some of the tivo fanatics particularly some of the people on the tivo community site
these folks believe that tivo is the ultimate and will lead you to believe it so you also buy it
others are so thrilled with some of the features they do not take the time to fully understand the product before writing a review
for example a subsequent to my first writing reviewer claims there is no need to purchase a box  a subscription but obviously has no idea what he is talking about
it is as plain as day on the tivo site
you need to buy the equipment  either a monthly or lifetime subscription
if you want to share between the units ie
record on one watch on another you also need to purchase network cards  the home media option for both units
it is not inexpensive
 units  lifetime service  cards  hmo  over  it is also a little disturbing to see only positive reviews in the amazon spotlight given that there are genuine issues to consider when purchasing this productif you are considering tivo now i strongly recommend that you wait until they release a product that is compatible with hdtv and digital audio before making the investment
they market these series ii boxes like they are the latest and greatest but in reality they are already about obsolete
remember a lifetime subscription pertains to the life of the unit  not your life
if you buy this now and find it obsolete in a year ie
when you buy hdtv you will need to buy another unit and service againthis is my second sony trinitron
now this one has fallen to the sony kiss of death
it keeps turning off and will not restart
it will run from a cold start for about  minutes and then die
i have gotten repair estimates of  
for a possible repair
this is a common problem with a poorly designed power supply that overheats
sony truly built a defectively designed tv
i am finished with sony
it is all baloneylogitech manufacturers rebate is a farce you will not get the rebate in most probablity
in spite of sending all the required forms etc for an earlier logitech product they say i have not sent the quotoriginal upcquot code
ha this camera is at least  years old
im not even kidding i have one in my order history from february  skip this and get something newer
id recommend the c its cheaper  right now
and its better in every metrici would buy this in a heatbeat but i run both mac os  and mac os x mass ox unfortunately this only works with os xi tried this keyboard for a week
i really liked most things about it but it has a killer weakness
the function keys dont work the way they should
when you boot they are in this new quotenhancedquot mode
some enhancement
ive been using computers for over  years and now they change the function keys
they put a key on the keyboard that lets you toggle it but you have to hit it every single time you boot
if you forget youre doing stupid things like cutting and pasting or sending email instead of the action you thought you were takingif they had an option to make it default to the normal state id have kept it but its a deal breaker as is
i would have given this combo a  otherwise
i love the mouse and cordless hookup is wonderful
this has to be the most boneheaded thing ive ever seen
i suppose if you never use your function keys this keyboard will be great but its ridiculous as is
get this  you have about  second to hit the flock key to toggle the function keys at boot so you can hit the f key to get into the bios on your machine or to hit f to get into safe mode
hope you didnt miss it
ive been a happy and faithful logitech user for  years
i will never buy another of their keyboards again as long as this feature is unchangedi have three of these mice all gathering dust the first a christmas present the second obtained when the christmas present died the third a replacement for my wife who confiscated the second mouse and liked its light weight even though it was explained that the mouse was a cheap poorly constructed product which accounted for its light weight
all three mice died all very soon after the end of warranty  hows that for precise product engineering
do you think macally will provide any replacement or reduction in price even if its only a couple of weeks past warranty expiration  no
 absolutely notas to the problems initially the scroll wheel begins to fail and finally does
shortly after the scroll wheel begins failing when the pointer is placed in an open window or pane of a browser the window or pane jumps up and down by 
needless to say this makes it difficult to track and select what your after in either window or pane
this finally becomes intolerable as you scrabble about trying to open the file that you want or select your item in the web pageas to tech support a joke
there seems to be only one techie who does not speak the kings  er  queens english
his comments concerning mouse failure proceed along the lines of you have been failing to properly be of installing the driver software
you must begin again to properly be of installing
this will be of solution to your problem
end of discussion if you can call it thatwhat macally calls customer support appears to be only one very rude young woman who is incapable of operating outside her very limited training box
no customer supporthelp heresuffice it to say i will not purchase any macally product of any sort again if i can avoid doing so
as to the mouse a poor product with poor support and in my opinion an extremely poor company as wellmy advice do not buy
essentially junknot only is it light and dinkyfeeling but on every restart the system complains that systemlibraryextensionsmacallymousekext was installed improperly and cannot be used which is odd as it works anyway
reinstalling from the cd appears to proceed normally but the message recurs
their website tech support area is no helpi would not buy one of these again
good feature list for the price and it works fine but it just doesnt feel like it belongs on a mac
its also much brighter than it needs to be and flashes red with any vibration including music i get the impression this light leakage is intentional to look cooli have had nothing but problems with this wireless router
the wireless connection setting on the router has to be reset every time i bootup my laptop in order to obtain a connection
and the ip address from cablevision keeps getting dropped works fine without the router connected and must be manually renewed every few days
the tech support people at smc refuse to believe that it is their router
the wireless card in my laptop works with  other wireless access points at my job perfectly
but still smc tech supports insists its not their router
i have tried every thing even a new smc router
i finally returned the router and purchased a different companys wireless router
needless to say the new nonsmc router works perfectly and ive had it for over two months nowas others have noted this thing tends to lose track of what it is doing and have to be rebooted sometimes several times a daytech support thinks the product has a few problems but isnt interested in dealing with themdont give up your fulltime money for a parttime producti bought this to copy my stack of vinyl to cds
unfortunatly the record players cheap price reflects its performance
i was not able to copy a single lp to cd without it skipping tracks
there are no adjustments on the turntable
i finally dug out my old dual  and revived it enough to use it
there is no match between my  year old dual and the pl
so far the dual has played all records without a single skip
after spending many hours trying to be happy with my purchase i finally threw the pl in the trash
i would not want to sell it in a garage sale or on ebay to someone who would expect a turntable that they could use
save your money dont buy this onewhen i received my first unit i thought at first glance that it was an unbelievably good bargain
it looked great and performed really well for about four hours
then the motor started to randomly speed up and slow down of course destroying the pitch and sound of the music
i figured this couldnt happen again so i shipped it back and received a second unit which also performed well for about the same length of time before it went bad
i also noted that the belt used on this model is very small and thin although this wasnt the source of the problem
both of these units were manufactured in march  and may have been part of a unique production batch that received defective motors but i wasnt willing to give it a third try
i have a friend who has a slightly more expensive audio technica model and hes been very happy with his
i suggest you go for a nicer model if you want to be problemfreenot the greatest sound quality but now after playing  songs only it started to slow down considerably cant use it anymore and i dont have the original packaging
can i return it like that
besides the packaging the turntable itself is in excellent condition hardly used at alllefteris kritikakisi purchased a hoya cirpl filter on amazon
i am an experienced photographer and can say with certainty that it doesnt work
at all
regardless of position of the front element relative to the rear there is no change in color saturation reflection or any of the other criteria that circular polarizing lenses should correct or effect
in one instance i was able to take better reflectionfree photos through a window with my iphone than with my canon eos rebel xti with the cirpl filter on either my efs mm lens or efs is ultrasonic mm lens
in short the two elements of the filter might as well be made of window glass
fwiw this particular filter was manufactured in the phillipinesi wrote to hoya and am waiting to hear back
i will update when and if i doi did alot of photography in the past and hoya was a filterlens you could count
im now getting back into this format and boyoboy hoya is not the same
this lens was spottedbuyer beware this is no longer the same product
maxell has recently changed their audio cdrs
formally they were manufactured in japan now they are made in taiwan
all the older maxell discs would play in everything
however a large percentage of discs in this new cdr media are defective
the new discs will no longer play in my panasonic boom box or in my honda car stereo
worse some of these cds will fail to play in anything after a few daysmaxell has been one of my trusted use for blank discs for longer than i can rememberup until sometime in when maxell changed their discsheres the differencethe  model has the maxell guy on rhe left and the cdr tihng on the right
on the top it says maxell in big letters
also if you feel the background it is a whole lot more stable
it doesnt chip easily
also the plastic used was not scratched easilythe  model is a whole lot worse
it says cdr onl eft highlighted
on top of that it has maxell in small letters
on the right it says  and the maxell guy is right below it
the top of the disc is obviously used with cheaper material and it scratches easilyanother thing noticeable from the two is burn errors
ive had no burn errors at all with either of the  models regular or music
on the  model at least  failedalso when using nero express i tested imation and sony cdrs just to make sure my recorder was ok imation had a  fail rate and sony had a  fail ratemy recorder works finealso i tried burning at slower speed with no better resultswhy would imation and sony work on my computer and maxell wouldnt
because maxell cdrs are garbage
avoid at all costs get imation sony or get maxell but only if the discs look like i explained on the  modle becuase those were literally the best cdrs ive ever ownedi used to buy these all the time
they were made in japan and had a bluish dye to them and when you held them up to the light you couldnt see through them
i never had a bad burnthe newer ones are now made in taiwan
they have a silver dye and are seethrough when held up to the light
these cds suck
dont buy themthese headphones dont do what they are supposed to cancel external noise
on top if it adds it own hiss
in other words you are better off using a regular pair of headphones or one of the noise blocking earbuds than these noisecancelling ones
i bought mine about three years back had thrown them into my basement because they did not work but just rediscovered them after moving to a new place
im astonished this model is still selling
dont buy it im about to try the sony mdrncas another reviewer pointed out the picture in this listing is a monaural adapter showing only one band around the plug where stereo plugs have two
i took a chance that the written description was accurate  that this was a stereo  to  adapter
i needed it right away so i had it overnightedwhat i received was not only a monaural not stereo adapter it wasnt even a  to  adapter
what i received was a monotostereo  to  adapterwith this kind of uncertainty you might want to opt for a different item with a clearer more consistent listingi should have never ordered this item
should have read the negative reviews first
save yourself the 
got this thing and the first day it breaks
my speaker fell off my desktop and the plug broke right off like it was nothing
not worth the metal its made with
dont order it
i decided to take the loss of my  since id rather not deal with customer service even if i could get a refundi was sent a  to  
adaptori had to make an emergency trip to radio shack to get the correct adaptor but amazon did refund my moneyi wanted a  to  mono to stereo
what i got was a  to  stereo to mono
i think ill just go to a brick and mortar and buy it there
this page is too confusing and potentially a waste of moneyi had this radio for six months when the button for presets broke
it would not work
so i called sangean very disappointed
i had to send it back with  for repairs
the case needed soldering
stick with sony
this radio is not worth ten dollars
 day warranty just enough for them to rip u off
this is the second sangean i had trouble with and will be the lastsomething is wrong i have this same exact model at home and love it
i bought it a few years ago at my local camera store
i purchased this one for my vacation house so i wouldnt have to bring it back and forth
it is nothing at all like the one i bought a few years ago
the bubble was broken off when i got it but the box was not damaged at all
i didnt even notice the bubble was broken at first
i set my camera up on it and tried the different functions
it was jerky and not at all smooth when panning
i couldnt find the bubble to see if it was level i thought they moved it but it was nowhere
i looked in the bottom of the plastic bag and there it was
at first i thought i just had to snap it into place
wrong
it had broken off completely
i can only guess that this tripod isnt being made where or how it was before
dont waste your moneythe thing was useless to me because my device needed a power plug about  mm larger
advert was misleading that it would fit the listed cd playersthe sound is okay but i dont recommend this item for one simple reason no power cord
it doesnt state at least in the description above that theres no power cord included with this unit
that costs extra time and hassle
there are a lot of units out there that do come with a power adaptor buy one of those insteadthis adapter is not for use with a radio
i live in a fairly strong signal area and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out am  a kw station
 which is what i listen to most oftenthe use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless
on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lostinvest in batteries rather than this productwarning  i was about to buy this ac adapter for my grundig ga radio
i thought i would check ebay first
the one listing on ebay had a better picture and it was clear from the diagram printed on the unit that the polarity is reversed
this will not work with my radio and amazon says it willbecause of the negetave coments on this item regarding feedback noise and even though my primary use is for cdmp books and not music i didnt buy it
instead i purchased the one from radio shack part number  that was suggested by one of the reviewers
there is no feedback noise associated with this power adapter in either music or cd modei was going to buy this to power a sony sw radio i have as i try to spend a month in israel every year
the sony weighs a bit and i would have been very sorry to take an adapter with me that did not work
thanks for the advicei bought this radio for am usage
when you plug it in with ac you get noise on am
sony discontinued the old adaptor that had no problem with nose and introduced this one
i thought sony meant quality
this radio is junk for me and i am returning it
i called sony and they were aware of it but not too concerned
they told me to search the net and find the old adaptor
it sells at a premium no thanks sonyi bought the velbon e when it first came out a couple of years ago
it was not long before the leg mechanism broke internally
i had a very hard time getting the velbon address to mail it back to for warranty work
i finally found the address after contacting the vp of marketing at velbon and mailed it backafter receiving the repaired unit it worked again for a few weeks and then broke again
it has been sitting in my drawer since
i am going to return it one more timemy advice  its a great concept but is of no value if it breaks this easily
i would avoid this producti was very disappointed that an isolation transformer failed to resovle the  hz hum nose emanating from my electric guitar amplifier
perhaps this particular model simply is not robust enough
i returned it for a full refund but had to pay return shipping this is a heavy device that is expensive to shipif any musicians have suggestions then please leave a comment
thank yousee the attached photo  when it appears  to see the problem
a gap in the needle nose pliers that should not be when fully closednot a heavy duty outlet strip
if it did not cost so much i would have returned
found a heavy duty outlet strip at walmart for less money
do not waste your money on this itembeware  the new ones are junk
the ones with black cords have a main button that has a hair trigger and doesnt click
im having to take them apart and unsolder the microswitches and move them around
have wasted  buying many of these all from different vendors cant find a good one
one was doa the ones with silver cords click but are way too slowconsider this a no stars reviewyoud think this would be pretty good because it bares the olympus name however it didnt work right out of the box
dont waste your moneywould not display screen displays no signal maybe its my monitor still have to trouble shoot that i will give a update another review after i trouble shoot my monitorthis item doesnt work
i tried to use it with a dvi source to output to vga
im an it manager and seller of electronics so i tried every trick in the book
no dicethey should informed you that digital signal cannot be converted to analog  because of that i wasted my money more details should have been given such as you would also need an adaptorwe got new hp zrw monitors the worst in the world at work
the computer i have only has a vga and an hdmi plug for monitors
usb input can also be used but that solution only results in a small subset of video resolutions of the other two options
those of us that dont have dvi plugs on our computer were given a dvi to usb adapter module
and i thought if i replaced it with this i would get more resolution choices like the hdmi option
instead it doesnt even see the monitor with this plug
if i unplug it i get a message that a monitor was unplugged but when i plug it back in it doesnt see anything and the monitor shuts off
maybe it works in other situations but not this onei purchased this item thinking that i could go from vga to dvi since my home tv does not support a vga input
well i got nothing well not to really say nothing but all i heard was a beep like it was trying to work but then nothing
i tried using this on another laptop that i own and again nothing i thought it might just be the connection so i just went from dvi to my tv using my other laptop and that worked fine
i for some reason can not get this device to change the signal at all
so like the other person posted this is a waste of moneyakwingnuti wanted to connect my cable box hdmi out to my vga input only aoc monitorit did not worki bought this so i could use a dvi cable and hook my pc to my tv
i had been using a vga cable with an adapter on my pc but wanted to push my tv so it was flush with the entertainment center the dvi to vga cable prevented this as it was on the back of the pc  this cable would have been perfect if it had worked
i tried several dvi cables that i knew worked and no signal at all
i am returning this to amazon todaynot much more to say i plugged it in it did not work
dont waste your money
more words requiredam using a kvm which is only dvi  which for most desktop type cases these days is fine
however the two laptops i have that id want the option of using on one port are only vga  hdmi
this did not work there was no signal pass through at all
i see it has worked for some others  maybe the local computer store guy can hook it up for someone and make them happy  too cheap to pay to return iti purchased two of these
neither of them worked with any usb device i tried and i tried several
dont purchasei ordered  of these usb extensionswith usb  devices  devices tested one cable worked sometimes and the second cable worked rarelywith usb  devices usb mice and keyboard both cables worked finebe warned these are not high speed cablesthe  ft version of this cable is sold by the company cmple it is not the same cable listed in the description
cable quit charging my iphone after only  uses
make sure that you get the cable sold by amazonthey are fing gray not whitethey slapped a label over the one that reads gray usb  standardthe new  label reads white usb  standardwrong color a problemworse they do not support  my keyboard an apple wired typei dont want to bothered with a return for a lousy low cost item like this
even if i got free shipping the trip to the post office to mail it cost me more then they are worth
when a company does this type of mislabel i get so annoyed
it cost me time and aggravation
for what an item that is well under  bucks
well if you want gray cables that dont work with apple keyboards buy these  white  ones
this  company should be avoided there is no way the over label of white  usb can be an accident
they are just hoping people dont return them
thanks for nothing but more work for a lousy few buckswill not work with eyetv that no doubt requires a more robust quality cabling to power the device
this cable would probably be ok if it didnt need to power somethingbought this cable to use with a  gb usb drive
it was enough to power the hard drive but not enough for windows to detect the drive
i ended up using it to connect a printer
not recommended for connecting hard drives or for high speed data transmission
you get what ya pay for i guessthey dont work or work for very short period of time and then for some unknown reasons they stop working
its a great idea but the construction of it leaves much to be desired
i hate through money away on junk like this no matter how little it wasconnected my original iphone cable to this in order to extend its reach while my phone charged and it did not work
do not buysee the cat  ethernet cable adapter review
it was either that one or this one i never received
the one i did receive came directly from singapore and fell apart
i used super glue then it workeddid what it was supposed to but stopped working after  months
it wasnt that i was constantly plugging and unplugging cables from it i simply used it to connect two ethernet cables and left it alone
by the way i have tested both of the cables in question and both still work perfectly
very disappointing
i replaced it withtripp lite n modular coupler straight rjff which is working perfectly so farbe careful with this item pins  and  come disconnected intentionally
you can clearly see in the receptacle that pins  and  are bended downward
this is a pin coupler sold as an pin coupler unbelievablethese are cheap chinese junk and didnt last any time at all
ive since purchased others from belkin made in the us and they have worked without any problems for over a year
pay a bit more but get better qualityi kept clicking on the free download option but all i got was ads trying to get me to buy versions of memorex software
i finally got tired of trying to get memorex to make good on their offer whereupon i decided to cut my losses trash their useless to me labels and firmly resolve to avoid all memorex products in the futurei use large quantities of matte cd labels for inkjet printing and was very pleased with the memorex brand for ten years  colors printed vivid and true the labels were easy to apply and adhered well
but the most recent pack i bought proved  completely different
their new paper has an obvious grayish cast that takes color poorly eg reds look brown blues look gray and the finished labels look dull muddy and cheap
this new paper is also so thin that ink bleeds into the adhesive layer and the labels are prone to wrinkling during application ruining the cdwhat was once an excellent product has been cheapened into one too shoddy to waste a cent on
i will never use memorex labels againwindows  users beware
i bought this product was listed on microsofts site as being windows  compatible
however neither windows update nor the usrobotics site have drivers for it
worse windows vista drivers dont appear to be available
not sure who the target users are but im not one of themi tried unsuccessfully for a half day to uncurl four of these
no luck
had to tape them down with gaffers tape to make them safe
dont even think about using them in colder outdoor settings
fortunately i still have the inland version of this product which is much easier to work withwhen i received the package the box from the cord concealer looked as if it had been open
i dont like how it is rolled up because it makes it very difficult to get it to stay flat while you tape it
also you dont get enough tape
i only used  ft of the cord concealer and i didnt have enough tape to cover both sides of the concealer so i had to leave gaps in between to cover the ends and the middle of both sides
after a couple of days the tape slowly starts to come off due to the cord concealer wanting to roll back upthis might be good for one cable or a couple of wires but it does not have enough room to meet my needs
i was looking for something to cover a coaxial cable and a couple of pairs of speaker wires
the channel for the cables on this cover is less than  by 
it is closer to  x the sides have furled up and do not set flat on the floorwhat a failure i needed to cover a cord but this thing never got flat even after being heated
after a couple of weeks it keeps curling up and becomes more of a hazard than just the wireswhen i hooked this cable up from my mac mini to a tv there was interference on the signal
when i hooked up a different s video cable that i had there was no interference
i dont recommend this cablei simply hate itevery  hours i have to reboot italso i upgraded it through internet to the latest firmwareis it something else or the modem itself i cant tell but with the same line and pc there were no such problemsall i have changed besides the modem is the router a dlink dglbefore that i used the wire hgb worked great well i simply dont recommend iti just bought a toshiba e from amazon and expected to use a pair of sandisk mb sd cards but when all parts arrived the sandisk cards seem to be nonfunctional in this pda even though several reviews of both sd and pda used both together
when i inquired at toshiba they didnt confirm or deny that the sandisk products should or wouldnt work they merely said to check the manufacturers website for a compatibilty listwhen i did that and selected sd cards and toshiba products no results came up which while not stating it unequivocally implies that sandisk sd media is not compatible with the toshiba productshow something with an sd logo on it would end up being incompatible with another product also bearing that same logo is beyond meso you may want to think twice before buying this sandisk sd card if you have a toshiba eeven after reading the reviews in this forum i still bought one of these cards because the price was so good
i also thought that the problems were only with palm products
they are not
i put the card into my rca lyra mp player loaded songs onto the card started playing one of those songs and the player shut down after about  seconds
after trying several songs and having the same result i played songs from the internal memory and all worked fine
i tried this with many different songs and anytime i play a song that is stored on the card the player just shuts itself offbtw this card was made in chinano matter how good the price is heed the warnings in these reveiws and dont buy this cardi had the same experience as another reviewer here the sleeves smell very strong i put them out in the garage till i can return them
i bought these elswhere but came here to see if others had the same experience  low  behold yes they did
to me its almost a musty odor probably has something to do with them having to be shipped from taiwan
the sleeves ive bought in the past were made by ampad here in the us ill go back to buying their brandi was expecting better keeping the good netgear reputation in mind
however i was very disappointed by the reception
my computer that i used this card in is no more than  feet from the router which has proven itself to me in many ways
but the wireless netgear cards reception stinks
signal quality and strength typically stays around  and  if im lucky
this was not the case with certain usb wireless cards and the linksys pci wireless network card
i attribute the poor reception to the small size of antenna
the linksys counterpart has a much larger one and receives wireless signal much betteri strongly recommend you not buy this item and go with the linksys counterpartthe picture quality of this webcam is best described as one you might expect from a lowend webcam you bought  years ago
very disappointing and the extra features as a digital cameravideo clip camera are only frills to hide this fact
with picture quality so bad none of the extra features matter anywayi absolutely would recommend buyers to look at other alternatives
if you receive this as a gift see if you can return it to the storeas many have said this product is not your standard plug n play and linksys support sucks
you would think they could answer a simple question like is this print server compatible with an epson cx
 but obviously not
i spent many hours and much frustration trying to get this to work but to no avail
i guess the krux of the matter is dont try using a print server on a combo printer
im returning mine and i guess ill stick to a standard printer connectionin fairness to linksys i will say that all other linksys products ive bought have been easy to configure and worked greati bought this modem to run with my ivm interactive voice machine i did finely get it to work
some problems i encounteredno cd and not enough paperwork to download the drivers
i called tech support and they said download here
the driver they have wasnt an exe file
i spent too much time figuring it out
i had to beat it into my computer
lolfull duplex no way this is a half duplex modem
just copy the full duplex and half duplex and past it into google and do your research
also the caller id didnt work at all
bummerthe multitech website has software that you can download to use with the modem but you had to buy it
i did try the software but i wouldnt buy it for the price
it was hard to use and it had a doss like look and ran like doss
you can find better phone software on the netim lucky if i can get it to download  meg without locking up
only supporte  meg cards  not   will not support secure digital cards
built like a plastic toynot happy
am returning this piece of junki bought one at costco and ended up returning it thanks to their excellent return policy
here are my thoughts its pricey and for the money the included headphones do not fit well and fall off in sports activities the battery life is very short the clockdate resets when you change batteries the controls are very easy to accidentally hit in sports activity no crossfading of songs the fm radio is difficult to use and has poor receptionand finally it may look rugged but despite the fact that it is even in a padded belt clip falling just  feet onto a carpeted floor made it break
not very good for sports ehin short i cannot recommend this unit for its intended purpose of a sports mp playerai bought this last week looking for a rugged player
i read the reviews here and saw some people say it stunk some people said it was great
the first time i used it i was thrilled
and thought the naysayers were idiots
well after about  hours use it started to sound like an old walkman on low batteries
you know quoti got one hand in my pooccckkkeeettt annddd thheee ottther one haling a taxi cabquot
not only that but whenever the volume was at  or higher it randomly pauses
also the casing is incredably cheap
anyway i took it back to bestbuy where i got it and but the creative labax muavo nx   so far i highly recommened it over this product even though you gotta pay more
and oh yeah always buy extended warrantines on any mp player every bad review ive read here already sums it up i had the same nightmare with this horrible machine
avoid save your money get an yepp zen or ipodat first i was excited with my new rio mp player
i downloaded my favorite songs upgrade the card etc
but then i dropped my rio player
and that was the end of it
i called customer service and was sent from one person to the next to the next to the next none spoke english
i finally found out their customer service phones are answered in a foreign country
ok i understand we all need jobs especially the third world but they dont understand me and cant help me
then i finally get someone who says i must prove i purchased the rio player to get a customer authorization number to replay my rio because it cant be repaired and must be replaced
i only dropped it once on my living room rug  how weak is this device anyway
this happened  months ago ive yet to receive my replacement
ive lost my money
hold off and save for a better quality player and better customer service
i do not recommend any rio products because of poor customer service which you will eventually needunit constantly shuts itself off and loses tracks even with a brand new battery
doesnt fit in belt clip case provided by manufacturer
comes with itunes software but isnt compatible with itunes
and to add insult to injury you cant return it to the store once youve opened it
you have to jump through hoops to return it directly to the manufacturerin short save your money this thing isnt worth it
either go all out and get the ipod or go with a great mp alternativea sony net md playeri cant believe i bought this thing
the holder is of very poor design cannot manipulate buttons easily and the clip broke after  months of use no accessory source to replace
now like the other reviewer i must hold the thing in my hand while running kind of defeats the purpose of quotsportquot player doesnt it
i dont care what anyone says the radio stinks pure and simple
i am going to try to take it back to the store i bought it at but am not real confident
in any event no more rio products for mesave your money i should have taken the advice of the other negative postings
i had this on my home network for three months and it only worked for the first  weeks
i even did all of the updates and patchs and it could not handle my vpn to work and the wireless would surf at below dial up speeds
i had to buy the linksys to replace it and it has been working greatgot this router  months back
was very happy to see the design of the router and misunderstood that it will even perform to the same level
first time i insert the configuration cd into my laptop boom
my wireless network went for a toss
thankfully my laptop has restore functionality which allowed me to restore the settings prior to the netgear installation
im savedit worked soso for about a month
after that everytime i want to connect to the net i have to shutdown my laptop for atleast  minutes and then start it again
after repeating this for  times it might connect
feels pathetic
i would prefer a dialup connection over this routerim giving one star since im able to connect to the internet atleast few times a daywhile easy to set up and otherwise works fine as a router it leaves something to be desired
i cannot maintain a persistent connection either in or out via this router
if i login to any of my usual working computers using ssh the connection is dropped and timed out after a few minutes meaning i have to login again on another shell
this is not an intermittent problem as when one connection dies i can immediately open another shell and ping the device or log in again  it just drops the connectioni also plugged my old nonwifi smc barricade back in and had none  of these problems so i know it isnt mei tried to email customer service and got no reply
i called customer service and got a fellow who didnt know what ssh is and whose only solution was to reload the driver from the very slow websiteso im returning this device and getting something else
probably a wifi smc barricadei bought this router and a netgear wireless pcmcia card
could not get the router to work properly with my motorola surfboard cable modem
spent  days on phone with netgear tech support in india difficult to understand themgave up
bought linksys
plugged it in and it worked
no configuration
linksys interface is slightly better
still no idea on why the netgear router gave me so much troublebottom linelinksysup and running as soon as i plugged it innetgear days and i gave up tech support no helphmm since most of the glowing reviews here are written by people without a profile i wonder if they are not fake reviewsim a real user and im not happy with the netgear mrv which i bought from amazon
note this regards the v version not the older onebasically the cable router part works ok  but wifi is a joke
i checked out negative reviews here and also on cnet and found that many people including myself get no more than  ft of reception with the netgear even in the same room
this is a far cry from the  ft indoors promised in the users guideworse i emailed customer service no phone number to call over a week ago and didnt even receive an acknowledgement let alone a response
i emailed them again this morning and its been  hours still no acknowledgement or response
this is one terrible company to deal with in the leagues of apple and samsung in terms of simply avoiding to assist their customersi suggest you avoid netgear until they improve their products and customer support
in the meantime go with a better brand like linksys or microsoftthis netgear mrv meaning version  router has so thoroughly messed up my network its just unbelievable
i tried to replace an old apple airport base station with this router
i have a dell with a microsoft usb wifi adapter an imac with an old airport card and they all worked fine with my old airport base station but i wanted some more ethernet ports
i hooked up the netgear and everything went to pot
after fiddling and fiddling i got the dell to talk to it wirelessly and the imac to work on one of the netgears ethernet ports it wouldnt work on the wifi at all
but thats not what i wanted and the thing kept dropping the connection
i emailed netgears customer support and guess what they said
they would be happy to help me if i would pay them 
it seems there is some fine print inside the box that says support is only free if my whole network is netgear equipment
the box says  technical support on the outside
ok so i am only paying  for this thing it is now unreturnable i give up
i put the airport back into my network i pulled the netgear out and tried to put my network back like it was
no soap
my imac cant seem to find the airport base station and the dell periodically drops the connection
this netgear thing has screwed up my whole system
wow
i guess im on my way to the apple store to get a new airport instead
i hope they can give me some clues on how to fix the imacs airport cardunless you have an all netgear system do not buy this or any other piece of netgear equipmentpurchased this a month ago and have been rather unhappy with this product which gives unstable wireless performancei was attracted to netgear by the rebate and now i regret it
i should have bought a linksys wireless routerap instead i thinkmy wifiready laptop is about  feet away from the netgear router
there are about  walls in between and reception is poor
about  of the time its fair  of the time poor and  of the time when i try to use internet its unavailable
this performance is just not acceptablethe manual set is also poorly written
you get two pieces of printed materials a confusing starter sheet and an isp information sheet
get this on the printed quotget startedquot sheet it asks you to refer to the manual on the cdrom before you should turn your pc back on
what kind of genius wrote this
luckily im a techie so i had no trouble deciphering the nonenglish guidethe routers major strength is its cool design but its poor signal strength means you should probably go with a more established brand like linksys or dlinkthe router described on amazons page and in the downloadable users manual offered as part of that description is not the router you will get
all information describes netgears original model the mr
you will get the mr v which has no stand is half the size has a db antenna rather than the original db and it is not removable like the original etc
the mr v is an inferior cost cutting product
which probably accounts for the wide range of ratings you see in the  customer comments
except for those that didnt get their rebates which means they paid even more for an inferior product
read those comments carefully before you decide to buy on price aloneand amazon  how about updating this page with current informationi suffered with this unit for about  weeks before i caved and returned it
i replaced it with a far more expensive apple airport extreme which works wonderfully
i have a mixed macwintel lani think my unit was defective probably a defective  switch
it worked well in wireless mode with range better than my older smc wireless card failed on that onei really stress my lan backups etc so i might expose problems others might not notice
i suspect though that this is a true defect that hits some of these devices
i wonder though if the mr ever works properly with a secondary external switchwhen i bought the device it didnt work at all with my cisco  dslrouter but a firmware update fixed that
still a bad sign that out of the box it was doa on my lantech support never replied to an email inquiryif you buy this device  do not send in the rebate until youre sure you wont return iti bought the mrv abotu  months ago
it has recently completely stopped working
if i unhook everything and power cycle my modem the router works again for about  hours and then it dies again permanently
as if i couldnt tell the shoddy quality of this thing just from pulling it out of the box and looking at it its performance has sealed netgears reputation of making complete trash
its worth spending more to get something that actually works
i plan on throwing this out my car window at a very high speedas much as i want it to work netgears mr wireless router does not work with my compaq  g enabled laptop
the laptop works great at borders tmobil hot spot compusas many wireless networks in their store etc
the router does indeed work with netgears own pcmcia card in the laptop but not the built in g which should indeed be compatable with the b standard
if you use netgears own pc card pcmcia you are fine but be careful with any other vendor which claims to have compatability with the b standard using netgear productsi bought it from amazoncom when it was on sale
it worked fine for over a year until i encountered some technical issues when i was changing the wideband internet service provider
i needed some technical assistance and i called netgears customer service
although i never called them before and never had to bother them for help they told me that i could not receive any assistance since the purchase had exceeded the threemonth period unless i agreed to pay a huge hourly rate
i was upset very much and vowed never to use netgears prodcut againfortunately there are other vendors in the market
i bought a linksys wireless router as replacement
it is such a pleasant experience to use and get help any time i need from linksyss customer service
i was told that technical supprt for the product is lifetime and i have since asked for technical support twice about  months apart the last time when i moved and had to reinstall the router in my new place
i really want to say many thanks to linksys and their excellent customer service
and surely i will never be a netgears customeri foolishly purchased this router a year ago when it was on sale with a mail in rebate
to this day i regret the decisionbasically the device is a piece of junk
the wireless signal strength is terrible and wont work past  rooms
furthermore the router will shut down its wireless component every  days so that you have to manually reboot the thing to get it working again
no amount of upgrading the firmware helped
netgear support was completely uselessif you are looking for a wireless router buy the linksys wrtggs and then go to  to install their custom firmware
you will have a  router with enough functions builtin qos custom firewall etc
to rival business class products five times its costpull the router out of the box plug in the network cable between my laptop and the router supply the network ssid isp ip information wep key and ip range for dhcp

move laptop next to wireless router and the connection stabilizes but it takes  seconds to get to each admin page
local throughput on a file copy approached kbsec for at least  seconds
web connections are hopeless
manual says to try a different channel
still awful
manual says to disable wep
still awfulsend email to tech support with details of problems including the fact that i upgraded to   they tell me to upgrade the firmware to   i am getting a little upset and tell them i have already upgraded the firmware
they give up and send me to phone support
i call netgear and explain my problems including the frustrating experience with email support
phone support tells me to upgrade the firmware to   i sigh quietly and explain one more time that i have already upgraded the firmware
phone support sounds puzzled by this
phone support puts me on hold and later tells me to change channels i do so with no effect
phone support seems baffled i ask if it could be that the product doesnt actually function as advertisedi give up on phone support and send the netgear mrv back to amazon for a refundthis router is awesome
it really is
design is great
connectivity is greatif you want wep encryption forget it
theres a problem in the firmware or hardware or something that drops your connection after  minutes in wireless mode
disabling wep eliminates the problemif you have a centriono notebook forget it
confirmed problem from netgearif you need technical support hah good luck talking to a bunch of nonenglish speaking indiansthis has been extremely unreliable
it loses wan connection frequently within minutes
sometimes it is connected but will not pass any dns traffic
even resetting does not help
stay away from itupdate this is completely dead now
even the ethernet ports are deadi bought a wireless netgear mr almost a year ago
after a couple of weeks of usage the wireless connection started to break up
assuming i had interference from my unshielded tv cables i hardwired ethernet connections to the router and everything worked fine
a couple of weeks ago i started to get download error messages then i started having trouble with sending and receiving emails same problem two different computersi sent six emails to netgear and called twice
they had me update the firmware and change the mtu size to   and finally  nothing helped in frustration i bought another netgear ethernet router rp  i am still using the same settings as with the original router  and i got perfect communicationsi tried to get an rma from netgear under the three year warranty
even though the replacement rp from the same company works fine i was told that they could not give an rma and that i would have to call their premium service at a cost of  to have them diagnose the mr over the phone note that i have already been in touch with customer support for two weeks
if premium service is unable to fix the problem they would then give me a rma
it seems to me that the  probably covers the cost of the replacement router
they have lost a customerthis one was garbage and dumps out after about  hourapparently rev
 or b has upgradeable firmware
but not this crapsteronward
to goodwill ye shall be tossedthis router seems to have a range of about  feet
seriously
i recommend the similar smc wireless routeri tried for a couple of days to get this adapter to talk to my ipaq h
i managed to get filesharing to work but not the networking internet or activesync connectionsthe manual is next to worthless and nearly devoid of usable informationincidentally i have some spread spectrum wireless phones that are  ghz units
the working range with this adapter was about  feet
whether it was due to the phones i dont know but i was very dissappointed in the rangei purchased the belkin bluetooth ft usb adapter so that i could synch my ipaq  pda
however after software installation i could only get bttray  incorrect license type and error  unable to start stack service
when i contacted belkin tech support i was told that the problem was caused by the microsoft service pack   according to belkin microsoft has included their own version of bluetooth in sp and it is not compatible with the belkin adapter
when i asked for their suggestions they replied that i should uninstall sp
they told me that sp works with some devices and xp works with everything
i asked when they were going to update their drivers to work with this adapter and they said that they didnt know
microsoft had not yet published their interfaces
my feeling was that as far as the company tech support was concerned the device works ok with xp original so any problems i am having are just my tuogh luckthis is the worse mp player i ever owned first the batteries are proprietary not aa as was advertised
it also skips and out right refused to play some mps even after i put them on a brand new cd
after i did that i put the old cd in a friends mp player made by memorex it worked great
its also not any thinner than a normal one
my recommendation stay as far away from this frightful thing as possibleit looks cool has a lot of features comes with lots of accessories the batteries last a long time  this seems like it should be a great player but the radio wont tune correctly to stations below  or so  it just keeps receiving the bottom of its range no matter what the station is set to it wont read some audio cds that i tried saying no disk it wont read a cd of mps that i burned replacing the contents of some directories with random ascii chars it seems to chop off the last second of some of the mps on one of the mp cds that i burned it chopped up about half of the songs into multiple songs resulting in a blip as it goes from one to another  iow it will list a song three times with playing time for each one a third of the total time sometimes while playing mps it will randomly jump to the middle of another mp in another directoryi wish i had read these reviews before i bought this mpcd player
i saw it in circuit city and thought that it had a lot of features i liked so i purchased it
what a big mistakeproblemso skips on regular audio cds even when sitting stillo skips and pops when playing mp fileso jumps from one mp file to another in an entirely different folder 
o fails to recognize folders showed strange japanese characterso fails to recognize some mp cds at allive only owned this player for a week
how could i have encountered this many problems in such a short time
i actually exchanged the player at the store today because i thought i had a defective unit
from reading the rest of the reviews i realize i have a defective productdont touch this player with a foot pole
im returning this player tomorrow and getting the iriver slimx imp cdmp player insteadall i have to say is this is the worst player ever
my mp cd player kept on skipping and having a rough time playing cd music
i didnt even bother of keeping it i just throwed it outside my window into my trash can
there is way too much negative description for this player and it is way too much that i am not going to list themriovolt if you want to try to make a better innovation for the community then i suggest you to fix up this riovolt sp
stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this mp cd playersome buttons on this like the eject button does not work with the latest mac software
there is no sofware update to fix this problem either
dont buy thisfell apart within a month of normal use
absolutly the worst keyboard design i have ever seen and cant be repaired like a regular boardthe claim that the macally slim keyboard is a scissor switch keyboard is patently false
this keyboard is decidedly not a mechanical switch keyboard of any sort
anyone who thinks otherwise need only pop off the extra key that isnt used below the shift key on the right
if you pop this off which you can easily do with your fingernail you will see a scissorlike mechanism but the sole function of this is to hold the cap in a stable roughly level orientation
this scissorlike mechanism has absolutely no effect on the feel of the switch
the switch itself is contained within the little plastic capsule that looks like a miniature bottle with a neck
when you push straight down on the top of that neck the neck inverts down into the capsule
the feel is slightly different from the feel of a typical membranedome switch but the difference is negligible
to the extent that there is any difference in feel it has only to do with the behavior of that little bottleshaped plastic capsule and has absolutely nothing to do with that little scissorlike mechanism that you see under the capi repeat this is not a scissorstype mechanical switch
for intents and purposes it is an ordinary membranedome switchin a true scissors switch the mechanism introduces a nonlinearity between motion in the direction of the key cap travel and motion in the direction along which the spring is compressed
it is this nonlinearity that gives the mechanical scissor switch its characteristic feel
this keyboard does not use this mechanism
it does not have the feel of a scissorstype mechanical switch because it is not a scissorstype mechanical switchthis is just a cheap runofthemill keyboard
the mechanism is cheap
the force is excessive from when you first start to depress the key
the top surfaces of the individual keys are much too flat and because of this my fingers tend to wander from sidetoside so much so in fact that i have difficulty keeping my fingers on the home keys
despite the scissorlike mechanism that is supposed to hold the caps level they tend to wobble when you press the key offcenter
the exacerbates the difficultly in sensing the centers of the keys and this is highly annoying
in highquality keyboards there is a cylindrical protrusion on the under surface of the caps that slides within an opposing cylinder thus preventing the cap from wobblingi can find nothing in particular to like about this keyboard and no reason whatsoever to recommend it
it is just a cheap keyboard that is fully in line with the cost
if you want a keyboard that feels like a cheap  keyboard then this one is probably as good as any
but it is not i repeat not a high quality keyboard that you can buy for 
you get what you pay for and nothing morethere is no current driver for this keyboard buyer beware
i contacted the manufacturer and they confirmed this fact
this product is of no use to me whatsoeveri bought this product for a  notebook
i could see virtually no improvement in the heat reduction performance of the  fans
i was disappointed with the lack of quality in this product and turned off by its design and cheap plastic appearance
it did not appear to be constructed with any lasting longevity in mind
on that note i promptly returned it for a refund and purchased an aluminum frame cool master note pal
it has definately cooled down my computer and has been a good choicei bought a macbook pro which runs pretty hot and needed something to help cool the heat generated from the notebook
i opted to buy this targus pau notebook chill pad at a northern california frys electronics store since the price seems right and the spec was comparable to other models that costs  more without the sales discount offered at the timeanyway after using it for about  months i noticed that the fan noises started to get really loud and annoying
to the point that it is drowning out the sound from dvds or videos that is playing on the macbook pro
the amount of air that the fan circulates is also reduced considerable
trying to clean the dust built up was a real hassle design does not allow for easy cleaning
using the compressed air cleaners helps but it does not fix the fact that the fans seem to be spinning offbalance and rubbing against something when turned onby pure coincidence my roommate also has a targus pau for her laptop and she complains about the same issue after hearing the familiar loud and annoying sound coming from my chill pad
below is the list of pros and cons that we came up with for the productprosfans initially circulates a fair amount of air to help cool down laptopschill pad is not heavy so it is portableruns on power from usbconsdesign quality  poor
made of cheap plastic that cant support the weight of average size laptopsnotebooksnot much clearance underneath the chill pad to draw airdifficult to perform routine cleaning to get rid of built up dustrubber pads on the corners not sufficient enough to prevent scratching the bottom of your laptops with the chill padunit is light weight but bulky common complaint for almost all products in this categoryproduct lifespan for me is about  months my roommate gave up on hers after about the samefan noises can get extremely loud and annoyingunit has stopped working while plugged in and turned on and caused notebook to overheat and shutdown unexpectedlycant easily replace the small component fans even if you take the unit apartwould i recommend or purchase this product again
most likely not unless it is priced cheaper as a disposable equipment that you replace regularlygreat ideapoor buildit lasted  months and then diedi used this product for a few months and then it just completely died
i kept it in good condition and everything but it just stopped workingeven tho this is pretty cheap it totally doesnt cool down my notebook pc so its just a piece of totally useless metal plate
in theory it should lift up your notebook to allow better air flow at the bottom but in reality no it doesnt have any cooling affect at all
its cheap but still a waste of money for a student like myselfi bought the coolpad after reading the positive reviews here on amazoncom but am quite disappointed
my fujitsu has vents both at the bottom and in the rear so it doesnt overheat but can get quite hot when i edit digital videos a cpu and hard driveintense task
i bought the coolpad hoping it would help cool down the laptop so the laptops internal fan wouldnt have to work too hardto my disappointment there does not seem to be any cooling improvement whatsoever
if your laptop has vents only at the bottom and has no rubber feet then this may help
again its a strong may or might as in perhaps as acknowledged on the packaging
i suspect the coolpad doesnt elevate the laptop high enough for the convection principle to work in realityon the plus side the coolpad does insulate your laptop from the desk surface thus preserving your desktop as well as prevening spilled coffee from soaking up the bottom of your laptop computer
the upper metal plate also rotates which is nice for showing others the screen or when you use the laptop while watching tvbut the coolpad doesnt do its main job right hence its useless
if you want something that can really cool your laptop look for a cheap product called bytecc notebook cooler which has two builtin fansgot this item thru staplesat a substantially higher price than amazon
what a waste
this item was doait shut down my laptop instantly
dead
kaput
gone
the chill pads fan never workedand it shut down everything on my laptopno response at all
wouldnt even go thru the startup sequence
once the kill pad was unplugged from my laptop the computer returned to life with the help of a complete restore cycle
i could not return it fast enoughdont waste your money on this one
bad choice and a computing hazard
may damage your computer
i learned this the hard way this product is very flimsy
do not buy it
will not last for mroe than a few weeks unless you baby itbuy a zalman
i purchased this chill mat and it worked for a short period of time
the connector would not stay in because it was a prongtype connector and not a usb  connector
the company sent me a new cord but it would not stay in either
i tried every which way to support the connector so it would stay in but finally gave upbought the zalman and it has a variable fan which is almost silent and havent had a moments problem with ityou wont regret going with the zalmani purchased this laptop cooler last year at a retail store opting over models that cost  moreat first this worked pretty well
all i needed was the edge to handle some light gaming that my laptop couldnt handle without additional cooling
it worked well in that regardthis cooler has a usb powercord but the cord terminates as a dc jack to the back of the chillmat
while some people might consider this a plus this is the single biggest failure on this item
the dc jack input on the cooler itself was poorly constructed causing the fans to spin up and down for a while until eventually they wouldnt spin up at all
a laptop cooler that cant spin the fans is next to worthlesshowever this cooler has no channels for air and doesnt sit high enough from the table to even add airflow when the fans are off
in a very real sense this laptop cooler is actually worse than simply putting my laptop on top of a book for cooling benefitsi strongly recommend other people avoid this and find a better producti have a dell inspiron  that is now  years old and has logged hundreds of thousands of miles so i take care of my stuff
this chill pad asinbakay targus pau notebook chill pad was purchased for my notebook
it did cool pretty well
laptop speed performance and battery life improved while using the chill pad
after just  months of use i have just thrown the chill pad in the garbage
just three weeks after i bought it the plastic feet began to fall off
no problem i thought and purchased new plastic nubs to repalce those that had fallen off
whatever paint is on the unit the plastic bumps will not stick to even after using the original adhesive backing which has stuck to my dell for years contact cement and super glue
no plastic bumps on the bottom  big discomfort on my legs
today i noticed that my laptop was hot
i checked the chill pad and the fans were not running
initial troubleshooting pointed to the usb plug not making proper contact so power to the unit was intermittent
replaced the usb plug
chill pad ran for about  seconds
further troubleshooting revealed a broken wire at the flexy joint on the miniplug that plugs into the chill pad
the wire is so thin that i had a heck of a time trying to fix it very cheapand finally disassembled the unit and wired direct to the fans
testing my work only one fan was running
i surmised that even though i soldered all connections shrink wrapped everything and used a grommet at the edge of the chill pad case the targus wire was so thin that something probably pulled loose during reassembly
rather than waste any more bench time on a unit which had  gauge wire in it i threw the whole chill pad in the garbage
by the way my inspiron with a  lcd screen overlapped both sides of the chill pad by almost an inch
if you are looking for quality and a large enough cooling solution for a  laptop look elsewhere than this particular targus uniti bought a targus pau notebook chill pad to cool down my laptop in an effort to extend the life of the system
almost from the beginning it was problematic and represents one of the worst purchases i have ever made when it comes to computer equipmentwhen it was brand new it worked pretty well but it did not last
after a couple of weeks it started to get louder and louder and finally one of the fans decided to quit working
i disassembled the chill pad and oiled the fans spindle and that helped it for a couple of weeks before it did it again
so to keep the thing working i had to take it apart every couple of weeks and oil the fans
this was a nuisance but was not really a big deal as i have been through this kind of effort with other fans in the pastthen it began to just cut off and on intermittently
i traced it back to a short in the switch
by keeping some tension on the cord i was able to keep it runningfinally this evening it was making loud noises again and all at once it made a loud pop and cut off completely
it had selfdestructed  the fans finally developed some wobble and the blades hit the enclosure snapping some of the blades
so i dont believe i even got  months of total runtime out of this thing and its in the trashtargus usually makes good stuff but this particular chill pad is absolute junk
i cannot recommend this solution under any circumstancesi use a laptop at homeon my lap
ive gone thru two of these units now
the first unit lasted only about  weeks but id lost the receipt so couldnt do anything about getting money back
so i bought another and it lasted about  months until it started to not really work well and now a total of  months into ownership it finally died completely
the concept is great
the product is cheaply made and doesnt last as long as it should
computer stores sell this product for like insanetoday im buying a different brandwell seethe air flow from the two fans is barely noticeable even half an inch from themand flow is in the opposite direction of what i would expectie
the air is sucked in from the top and pushed out along a longnarrow strip on the long thin side
this causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad
and i suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in airi would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of itthere is no way to reverse the flow and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axletotal waste of money other than to see how cheaply todays products are madelet me first say that the pictured version the light silver one is an excellent product
ive been using it with a fujitsu t laptop for almost a year but it works great even on widescreen  laptops its whisper quiet vents all the air out the back and is not dependent on airflow from underneath whatsoever
some reviewers have commented on poor positioning of the fansthats actually a nonfactor due to the air channels which allow a small amount of air to constantly flow past the bottom of your laptop  and thats really all thats needed to keep heat from building up
i use my laptop to edit video which used to make it scorching hotand even with normal use i had to keep a phone book under it though even that got warm on the bottom after some time
the old version though thin and light enough to take anywhere even coach class on a regional jet made my laptop feel cool to the touch
ive been using as a bonus it drew a very negligible amount of power which at most cut down battery life by a few minutesnow the bad news one day the engineering and marketing teams at targus got together and were really bored
apparently the er surgeons of the usa were telling them to stop stealing their business by preventing burn injuries  so they decided to make their redesign so terrible that no one would want to use iti discovered this when i ordered the pictured item for some friends off of amazon im their primepimpthey sent me the new improved one twice
the old one sucked the air down and blew it all out of the backthe new one blows it up which causes the air to spread around which can still make you warm if its on your lap
also its much louder drains the battery of my laptop much more and heavier thicker etci could use the old one in classes with no one noticing but the new one is loud to the point that youd be embarrassed to have it in public
its definitely not something thats portable due to its heft and awkward size
another problem is that it draws air from the bottomso if you have loose clothing are placing it on a couch etc the air intake will get blockedlastly the fins arent shielded well and they arent built well
i had a few blades take flight and one of them made a nice scuff on my laptopi hope that they either  bring back the old version or  at least change the picits very misleading of targus to keep the same model number for a product that is in no way alike
thats like ordering a lexus es and getting a toyota carolla and the dealer justifying it by saying wellthey both do the same thing and are both made by the same company
the pictured version is at wlmrt its worth a test drive and the extra price
im just thankful for amazons great customer support and gracious return policyshame on you targus shame on yougot it on salewhat a waster
really noisy
ended up turning it off and using it like i did the cheaper version portable cool pad just for the elevation off the tablei bought this cooler at the same time as i bought my acer aspire  laptop almost  years ago now
it worked well for a few months and then began cutting in and out forcing me to jiggle the connector the usb cable plugged into to keep the fans running
eventually it stopped completely
i took it apart to see if i could repair the connector but it wasnt possible
ive been using the laptop without a cooler but im very careful not to block any vents
so far so goodits a small unit
i have a  macbook pro and i cant use it
im just gonna give it to someone with a macbook
i whish they made them to work with a  or  macbook proi have gone through three of these coolers
all with the same issues
either the wire stopped working or one of the fans
it is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long
it does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor
go with the antec laptop cooler excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year
the antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that onethis product became extremely frustrating to own the minute i needed it  a power failure
i was in the middle of heavy design work and it beeped for about  seconds before it died and didnt even help the pc hibernate
this has happened since for  years
now i am here shopping for a new one not made by apc
i need to replace this one and i realized what i waste this was
its a glorified surge protected and should not be used for anything serious
it will indeed failafter one month of use it now randomly beeps and randomly kicks the power off you can hear the relay inside the unit going up and down
doesnt matter if anything is plugged in or notanother notable the onoff switch on the unit does not turn off the  outlets that are surge protected
most computer equipment now are vampires draw power even when turned off
i personally prefer to cut the power to my computer equipment when not in usei have had better luck with other apc productsupdate aug  the unit magically got better
now it only does the random shutdowns once a month or so
i would raise the rating a notch or two if it allowed me toi didnt buy this from amazon
it was a delayed impulse purchase from a local store a few days ago
after getting it home i became curious about product reviews and checked with amazonuser experiences were a bit scary to say the least
creatives scant  day partslabor warranty only added to the insecurity
however the player worked sound was beautiful so i tried to convince myself that everything would be all rightthat was monday evening
as of friday morning the player was totally dead
pressingholding the power button did nothing even after inserting a new aaa batteryin fact i tried two brand new batteries with the same result each timethe memory module still functionsi inserted it into my computers usb port and all is well
i didnt buy it as flash memory for my computer however
i bought it as a portable mp unitand thats totally deadmy faith in creative labs is shakenfrom other users comments from my own unhappy experience with this product and from the pathetic excuse for a warrantyand creative even wants you to pay to ship the product back to them during the warranty period
forget it this item is being returned to the place of purchase within  hours
there are better choices from better companies with better warrantiesbuyer bewarei bought this mp player thinking that it would be convenient and also double as a hard disk to move files from home to work and vise versa
since i have had the machine i have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times within  months
currently it is not working at all
this machine has been extremely unreliable
often i would go on a trip and it would simple not work one then needs the cd and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again
and  after you reformat it you have to reinstall all the songs you had on there before
when it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were
i thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use
nothing is further from the truth
i am only upset  now because i cannot find the receipt to return this junk
please do yourself a favor and get something elsewhen my new fujitsu laptop came with a free muvo mb version i was pretty happy that i got a supercompact mp player even though i save most of my mpwma files on my ipaq  pocket pc
but after one week of use i was sorely disappointed with this poorquality koreanmade product with the creative labs nameive been a fan of creative labs ever since i replaced my dead adlib sound card with a creative over  years ago
over the years ive been happy with their sound cards so the poor quality of the muvo came as a very sore disappointment for a loyal customer like myself
let me tell you what happenedi loaded the muvo with about  songs
i went on a short trip and when i got off the plane i found the files on the muvo corrupted
it couldnt have been an airport xray scanner problem since both my ipaq  and my panasonic ewear camcorder are totally fine no errors with their flash memory
i reformatted the muvo and loaded a few new songs but as i type this right now one of them is corrupted and not playablesince i got this free i probably shouldnt whine but judging from recent reviews of creative labs products posted here on amazon i dont think they are the same innovative customerfriendly small company from singapore any morethe thing is cheaper at the circuit city website
thats all i have to say about itwell i bought the muvo in late  for my sonwithin  months problem occurred
we managed to useit and repair it reformat download new driversfor another  months
but eventually it just canteven be power oncalled creative lab support they said its exceeded themonth limited warranty
in the hope that they willfind the problem and theirconscience i sent them the broken device and  dollarsexamination feethe result came back quotit cant be powered on
if youwant to replace it please pay an extra  dollarsquoti was mad as hellin a fury i canceled my  dollars credit cardbill  and they didnt contest that
but i still missedthe  dollars i spent on fedex shipping
and i missedthe  floppy drive that i could have kept myself i learnedthat i may be able to use the broken mp player as afloppy drive by reading the reviews on this websitei will never buy anything from creative labthe muvo i bought worked very well during thewarranty period
after that it would not turnon even after reformatting
it still worksas a usb flash disk but wont play musicbased on research on the internet to find a fixi found that this is apparently a common problemwith the unitthis player is too old and not worth the money
spend a few more bucks and get a player with gbs of storage space and way better audio outputthis product and the bundled pinnacle  studio software delivered spotty performance
it generally capptured the video from tape ok but the interface and especially the capture format options was very nonintuitive
the dvd rendering was slow and results were hit and miss some were ok some failed outright and some were rendered with annoying frequent color shifts about every  seconds throughout the entire dvd
this all took place on a new fast machine with plenty of ram and disk space
im pretty comfortable with new apps but the studio  is very hard to figure out
consider the pyro av link from ads insteadpinnacle systems video editing software studio and studio pluspromises so much but delivers very little of it
furthermore the technical support they steer you to is almost nonexistantwith studio videos that i had edited and saved for later burning to dvd became impossible to access making all the hours i put in a total waste
studio and windows xp dont get along well resulting in frequent crashes and loss of data
emails to pinnacle technical support got no answer
when i read about studio plus i hoped all these problems would be resolved so i ordered it
now that i have it i find it wont install tells me i entered the serial number incorrectly after about a dozen attempts i have given up
again i tried to reach pinnacle technical support and am getting nowhere
its like beating your head against a brick wall
users groups say canopus doesnt do as much as pinnacle promises but it delivers and the tech support answers when you call
other people recommend adobe premiere but say its diffuclt to learnbut one thing for sure if you want to feel the agony of frustration try pinnacle studioi wish i had read some of the reviews here before buying this program
it looked great very nice design lots of options
a few crashes here and there but ive learned to save often
the real problems come in when you try and burn a dvd
its really bad at only burning part of your dvd which causes your movie to stop in the middle
adjusting brightness can lead to an black screen on final dvd burn
still images which you lay titles over etc all get lost when you save your project and reopen itits too bad the layout and design is just awesome
i had such high hopes when i read through it
i hope they can fix some of this for the next release since this version is nearly uselessseized my windows xp machine disabled almost all of my other usb input devices and now puts me in an endless loop of files not found for uninstall
i cant get it off my machine
software tries to load all this other crap on your system
the mouse might be nice but my suggestion is that all of the logitech programmers go back to programmers schooli purchased this mouse after reading the many positive reviews
but its performance is very disappointing
it wont move the cursor to where i want it to be and its very frastrating sometimes
it is lot worse than my old microsoft wheelmouse
this is my second bad experience with optical mouse
the extra functions with this mouse like navigating are nice but i seldom use them since a lot of browsers now provide mouse gestures that are more convinient than using the mouseive tried this on five surfaces  a soft foam mouse pad a textured pad a smooth plastic pad a dark wood table and a light wood table
i have four other kensington and logitech cordless optical mice that work on all of these surfaces
the mx lazily lags behind at best and skates off across the screen at worstits a little too narrow for my hands too
my pinky has to go a long way to grip it and it leaves my hands sore after a few hoursmine was new from frys but would stop responding could no longer ping it after a few minutes
resetting the router by unplugging it would allow it to work for another couple of minutesi guess i just had a bad one but googleing seems to indicate its a flaky producti got a netgear wireless router wgt that seems a lot better and barely bigger or more expensivei bought this two years agothen it went deadcontacted linksys and they said it the life of this router is only around  years anywayso if you want to buy a router and not have to replace it then find something elsedont waste your timewow
i suffered with this thing for  days before i gave up and returned it i bought a gigafast eer router instead and most of my problems dissapearedbad things about this network everywhere router runs hot
internet is very slow wice as slow as without this router
tech support hours are limited and are a long distance  didnt work with secure sites like hotmail ok neither did gigafast router at first because of earthlinks mtu settings but the very able tech support helped me there
if you are having difficulty with secure sites like hotmail or yahoo mailtry this  change the mtu pppoe client value from  to  and click  saveto prefacei am not a bose hater
they make some very good products which i own some of but they also make some that are not so good and overpriced
this speaker falls into the later categoryi test drove these at a big box store and i was shocked at how cheap they sounded next to speakers that were much less expensive
and the speakers in similar price ranges just blew these away
these have no base and no high treble
about the only application i can think of for these where they would be acceptable is as dialogue speakers in surround sound systems
and even then not in my house because i prefer my surround speakers to have better rangegiven some of their innovative technological breakthroughs bose should be ashamed of themselves for selling such a product and marketing it as a high quality item
maybe they are rugged and will hold up well bose has a reputation for that
but what good is that if the sound is not goodlots of good reviews which make me wonder what the people are comparing these to
i would just urge wouldbe buyers to compare with their own ears before they buyi watched spidermman on a bose set of speakers in  this consisted of the vsc center bose towers i dont remember the model number but its the one with the tweeter that point the wrong way and woofers in the backside and these bose  for surroundsthe sound coming from the center speaker and these speakers was so unbearable at high volumes that me and my friend agreed it would be best to turn them off and just watch the movie in stereo
they both sounded very muddy and resonance comming off the plastic construction was quite annoyting
theyre both cheap feeling in construction and i would not be surprised if they both used the same woofers inside the center and thesewhen you are buying these speaker you are basically buying from the bottom of the barrel of what bose has to offer which is really bad considering how mediocre their more expensive offerings soundafter considerable research and pricing i have found this product just what i was in need of
excellent sound productionmy new lens will not work with my canon new d
it will not screw on properly
i am returning itafter using this lens with other lens i conclude thatthis is the worst lens i have ever used so farand it is useless for crop sensor cameras
and i am wonderingwhy this lens came with canon d as a bundlewhenever i bring this lens out i always regretmm is not wide enough
and the general purpose quality of mm is below the general qualityif i compare this lens with sigma mm sigma is so muchbetter
sigma has so much quality and the sharpness is reallyamazing
i normally dont realize it until i switch the lens withthis low quality canon mm
comparing with tamronsmm within the same range i think that tamron isstill better
and i am wondering why you should use this lenswhen you use cropped sensor cameraand i you use an expensive full frame camera there is noreason why you make your full frame camera a cheap point andshoot by using this lensi bought this lens about  years ago with my d
first thing i noticed was the lens creep  the lens slides out very easily if held at any downward angle very annoying
the worst part is after very little use but just out of the warranty period the autofocus stopped working
google it these two issues are incredibly common
none of the suggested fixes worked for me and canon wants  just to look at it
canon ought to be ashamed for producing such junk and then not repairing their mistake
very disappointedeither it was damaged in shipping or i got a defective lens
for whatever reason the picture quality on any photo taken on this lens with every setting stop is onoff tested came out blurry particularly on the left side
photos taken with my old stock  lens were dramatically clearer
the zoom range was decent but im disappointed
sending this lens back
it didnt even come with a manual
i was really looking forward to a lens upgradeupdate i reordered the same lens from the same folks and surprise this one came in a real canon lens box with manual and everything
clearly the one i sent originally was not brand new
be advised if you dont get a manual and a canon box youre getting sent something that someone else returned
that said the new lens is beautiful
the shots are crisp and even using it for a few pictures its pretty awesome and the best lens i haveif i could id change my rating from  star to   for the hassle i went through returning the bad lens i have to take away a stari bought this lense about  years ago and used it very little
ive used it at christmas and various vacation trips
its by far the worst lense i own
in fact i have several canon lenses that suck
it seems canon has a problem with quality control
make as many new models as possible to keep share holders happy
i would rate this minus  if i could
canon wants  just to look and see if anything is wrong
plenty autofocus sucks pictures blurry no quality control
yes i feel better nowvery disappointed with this lens from canon it has been released from  and until now there is no improvement  the creep of the lens is not only annoying but also dangerous for its safety not very comfortable for a walking lens focus is slow colors come out washed out and at  you  need a tripod for a sturdy  image
the good range is between mm it looks great on rebel ti but that is not enough
i returned but i wanted to give it a second chancei looked for a used one but all were with dust inside and dented lenses  had the chance to compare it with the mm and i can say there is a big difference between those two lenses
i preferred to keep the  and i will recommend you keep your money for a better lenscanon generally makes excellent lenses but my copy of this lens is awful
even at f with a fast shutter speed and low iso images are blurry when blown up to 
it also suffers from severe ca particularly in bright settings
yes this lens is inexpensive but i cant recommend it at any price
you would do much better to save your money and buy a better lenscanon should pull the mm f off the marketi must have gotten a bad lens based on these reviews but then again maybe they dont have to look at thousands of images at  in a photo editor
this is the worst lens ive ever owned
it is soft soft soft
even my cheap mm  is significantly sharperone reviewer said its sharp on all four corners not mine
it is embarrassingly fuzzy on the corners at any aperture and the edges as well as the middle too and forget about zone focusing
one of the great things about a lens like this is you can supposedly zone focus so that at f everything from  ft to infinity is in focus  wrongfor the price this lens is a ripoff
this lens does have a sweet spot but youll wait a long time finding it and itll happen once in a blue moon
how can an image from a lens shot with a canon d at  and f on a sunny day be soft
unbelievable
another reviewer wrote it can be had used for  euros  i dont doubt it
whoever buys mine when i upgrade should call the policei bought this lens a few weeks ago and it consistently produces out of focus images at f through f  amazon was great to work with and they sent a replacement which turned out to be defective as well
ive shot several hundred images on each under various lighting conditions using my d mark ii body
the two exaples i evaluated are very poor performers at f and wider
one went back to amazon as defective another went to canon for a warranty claimi hope they can fix this lens because i really want it to perform as well as some of the better examples of this product out thereif you buy the  f l is be sure to test it at wide apperture values while you can still return itshame on canon for a poor quality control processi really urge everyone to stay far away from this product if you value your cassettes
the one i purchased mangled the first cassette i put in an irreplaceable one  how could i have been so silly as to put it in without testing the player
in any case this product really is a piece of junk
but then you get what you pay fori do want to add that amazon came through for mesave your money and buy the more expensive hoya super hmc haze uv filter
this filter ruined my precious vacation photos
stay away from thisthe construction of this jump drive is pathetic
also i recently lost everything i had stored on it
i have a simpletech mb usb drive and the construction of it is o times better
go with simpletech youll be glad you didi read the rebate problems some have encountered here but i still bought it
i recieved a denial from the company for not recieving the original upc
i had sent the original and i no longer have it to resend
how am i supposed to prove that i did
even if i had a copy of it it still wouldnt prove that i had sent the original
go figure
my impression is that im dealing with crooks who tease you with the rebate and find an execuse not to honor the rebate
i called them after going through a maze of prompts on a long distance call and they promised to take care of it in  weeks
im still waitingmy advice if youre buying it because of the incentive rebate dontas for the quality of the product i cant comment since i bought as a gift for a relative overseas
havent heared from him yeti purchased two of these drivesone for my business and one for my daughters college work
one had to be returned immediately as it would cause the blue screen of death whenever it was removed from the computerthere is little documentation for the device both with the package and at the lexar site one of the most laughably sparse faqs i have seen which leads to some misunderstandings  the data light which is used to tell when it is safe to remove the drive does not illuminate on windows  only on xp
this is not mentioned in the manual
i was told by lexar that this is normalit just is not mentioned in the manualas others have posted i have found the device can become unreliable after a short time
occassional blue screens when the drive is removed
when deleting very large files the blue screen is almost assured
within the first month i put in the drive to find all the imformation on it mysteriously gone and unrecoverable by me
i foolishly trusted the drive to hold the only files i had long enough to get it to another computer
i know i should have made a backup but it still should not have happened
soon afterward i found that the i could not rename files in the windowthey would show only the name given when they were created
this was true on whichever computer i used the device in
soon after that i could not drag files to the window either
i could only alter files that were already on the drive but not rename them
i use the briefcase function to transfer files between computers so i should have backups on both my home and office computers
one evening i found that one important file containing several thousands of dollars of transaction records for customer orders had mysteriously again disapeared from the jumpdrive as the briefcase files updated therfore erasing the copy stored on the computer too
as of this writing i have not been able to uncover the files which may result in many hours of record rebuilding and possible financial lossesi cannot recommend this device as a reliable method of either transferring or storing datai have transferred files between computers using floppys for six years now without these problems so i have to assume the jumpdrives are at fault
there are no other problems with the three other computers they were used onlexar has a help chat but it is slow and not very helpful
i used it a couple of times but the person at the other end was unable to solve the problem
both times i got the same person which leads me to believe they dont have a big help staff
the long delay between questions and answers led me to think that he was handeling a lot of peolpe at the same time tooif you have the time to wait a day or two between responses the email help is better
lexar did offer to try to extract the files the first time they went missing but as of this time even if they could i no longer trust the devices
i am writing lexar to see if i can return them for a refundi bought the drive from amazon who is not at fault here
they promptly replaced the original defective drive
lexar is now going to have to take the hit for the quality of their products because of the time that has passed between the purchase and the time the drive started to fail
well see what happensi run linux ubuntu  on my newly built computer
i have searched everywhere to try and find the drivers for the  and there are none
this card is from  and the manual recommends that you use windows  and  i found out that it used to work with linux back when they came out with the th and th version update
i am am sending this piece of junk backit was supposed to record for  minutes but it didnt even record for  seconds
all the card was designed was to sell you more software if you want to record for more than  seconds
i am a victim of their scamkeeps falling off my camera
not like the originalwell same thing here i bought this cap thinking it was going to fit the lens i had it didnt fitwill wait for future nikon lens purchasethe only reason im putting this as  star is because it didnt fit my camera
i dont know how to tell what lens fits on what ir what size to getthe most flimsy camera nikon has ever made with a very bad lens
junk
most used nikon film cameras are much better than thisthis is nikon in name only  the durability is just not there
nikon created a plastic toy that looks and acts like a nikon fmfm but it is not the same
the plastic build does not hold up under use and repairs are more than the camera is worth
if you baby your equipment then maybe this will serve your needs but if you are looking at it for teaching purposes  then do not waste your money
i strongly suggest buying a used nikon fm from keh or someplace for half the cost
you will get a much better built camera that will serve your needs for years to comefor the price of the substandard entry level cosinamade not nikon
junk for sale here you can purchase an older top quality mechanical slr made by canon or nikon in used but nearly new condition and have enough left over to have it clad by a professional camera tech and also for a fast normal prime lens and some film
though buying new is in my experience often the safer bet when it comes to camera equipment in this case you are simply wasting your moneyand if you are not constrained by the need to use a traditional mechanical camera then by all means do not for a moment consider shelling out good money for this junk
three hundred dollars in  will easily get you into mm outfits that cost thousands less than a decade ago
used professional gear beats new mediocre crap hands down in my bookbe warned this teleconverter does not fit all nikon lenses
read the specifications on nikons site before purchasing this teleconverter
i was disappointed to find out only a few lenses will fit this teleconverter
nikon has added a small piece of metal to block use of other lensesi wish nikon would allow other lenses to fit this teleconverter
they claim that the elements will touch
if that is so then all they need to do is make this teleconverter slightly larger to fit without elements touchingit would have made a great edition to any lens collectionthis device started out well
i even bought a ndhowever after only a month the mounting bracket to the monitor faileda week later the nd also failed
that one had just been supporting the lcdmonitor and not moved at all
the problem is a very poorly manufactured support which gets all the stressi would only recommend this for a very light un used lcd say under  poundstried to get a replacement and have yet to get an answerthis item seems like a good idea but the truth is it really does not work well
the threads are too shallow and the hinge part is always in the way
i used it for about an hour then took it off and went back to the teathered lens cover
if you want one for free ill send you minei so wanted to like this strap but i ended up tossing it in the garbagesee i bought this german strap years ago and it has been the best strap ever
but the label fell off so ive been searching for another one
i hoped this optech was its equal
both are neoprene straps with quick connects
but the german strap has skin neoprene on one side which means it never slips off my shoulder
sadly the optech strap has nylon fabric on both sides and constantly slips off my shoulder
i almost dropped my nikon quite a few times
bad design for the way i carry my camera
i tore the nylon off one side and solved the problem but now the strap looks like junk
not the way a pro wants to lookbut worse  the cheap plastic devices that attach the strap to the camera are too large too stiff and always  always get in the way
and after a while i got tired of being forced to move those darn things out of the way so i could shoot
i give up
into the trash it goesoptech doesnt tell you about these things and give few details about the construction so i cant tell if i should try another of their straps or not
the ones with the pro loop attachments may be better but most of those have large thick shoulder straps
that type is hard to pack in my already overflowing bag so i will pass on optech
hopefully they will see the light and resolve these problems
its not hard
but my advice is to pass on this strap and keep lookingi owned a  disc sony player for at least a decade before seeking to upgrade hence i assumed the quality was good based on prior personal experience
i also needed a recorder to play extended music playback for four to seven hours for office clientele
in short i was sorely disappointed after loading  cds into this  cd changer
consistent with the other reviews ive since seen for this this player lately especially here at amazon it has at least three major flaws i have experienced  it sporadically skips between discs in the middle of playback
 after  minutes of continuous play in the random play mode you can count on it to stop playback and spin at high speed without resuming play
resetting it or cutting it off results in an abrupt stop and an ominous screech that i am sure will result in long term damage
this happens consistently every  to  hours regardless of length of use ie two or three hours per day
worst of all the player has begun throwing discs
 discs at a time are displaced into the rear left well recessarea behind the carousel
you must remove discs and rotate the carousel to a point where you can reach in and retrieve the discs by hand
meanwhile these discs clip one another as the edges snap past each other when the carousel rotatesthere is no problem with sound quality per se and random play is acceptable excluding interruptions see above although not totally random at times
however reliability functionality and ease of use do not apply to this unit as malfunctions escalate over time
not to be too harsh but its best use may be as a storage unit for your cd collection
select a smaller unit an alternate model or a different manufacturer for better performance and do your due diligence in advance despite name brand reputation
ps
note the tag suggestions for this product none of which sent by mecornwallgreat facade within lousy performance
skips from disk  sony can do better
do not buy this product  waste of moneywe bought this machine for a christmas present for the inlaws knowing id wind up installing it
the first disk played fine but while i was eating lunch my fatherinlaw tried moving to a different cd
it wouldnt play
itd go back to the first disk and play it fine
so i shut it down restarted on disk  and now it played fine but wouldnt go back and play disk 
i moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an oldfashioned vinyl record with a scratch
both cds worked fine in another player
in the meantime motherinlaw is busy putting her collection of cds into groups for me to programnot this holiday season
this suckers going back to the big box store from wence it camelike most people ive slowly converted most of my music collection over to flac and  mp
so this cd player didnt get much action over the last few years which should add to its lifespan right
wrong
it just plain died
i had to take it apart to retrieve my  discs and then it went into the trash
ironically enough i pulled an old kenwood disc changer out of the box it had been in for at least  years and it works like a charm
go figurei had cdpcx  since  yearsno problem at allbut this one can not read the cds and making best afford to break my cdsworst this is not happened all the time and impossible to repairi dont trust sony anymorebut finally i remove the cove and remove all related loading mechanismi found a problemit was a switch which is not workingafter i replace the switch no problem at allbut i believe that this product never been in quality controlso nowfinally i have the chance to review a product that singlehandedly took out almost  of my total cd collection at one felt swoop
and it did
i have been a more than avid music collector since i was  years old
i am now  years old so that takes in a lot of territory believe me
i also am very eclectic in my musical tastes so i have a lot of differing forms and kinds of music
but i shant get too far from the point herei purchased one of these sony  count cd players several years back when i upgraded very seriously all of my av equipment
this was a counterpoint to the sony receiver that i bought and it was plenty steep in the price range
i was impressed because it would afford me the chance to use my collection much like a juke box all of my own and this was before downloads were all the craze and mps were just making a crack in the music world via largely to sony
at any rate i got into the cd craze very early into its introduction and i had quite a few cds by the time i got this unit
more than  cds but still a very substantial amount of my also favorite cds were put into this player for the reasons i stated abovein short before it ever reached the one year mark of ownership this product malfunctioned so badly that it broke and also deeply creviced a very large amount of seriously scratched cds so that there was barely  of them left after realizing that in an effort to save them i would have to take the hood off myself even if it did dewarrantized the player itself
it didnt make any difference the damaged had been done and the cds were totaled at least the majority of them werei have tracked this particular item that sony still obviously makes all these years later online and in big box stores where they still carry them and i can tell you one salient fact
it is never if this particular sony model is going to malfunction it is only a matter of when and just how badly the malfunction will affect the cds that are in it
i have watched the reviews of this changer over many different websites and online and inevitably someone else usually several owners report the same thing about this product over and over  again and again
it is like watching a train wreck happen and you couldnt stop it even if you know it is going to occur
its an awful thing and sony has had countless reports of this happening numerous times over the intervening years since it first was introduced to the public  as i was in its first year of marketing  and its always the same and it hasnt stopped them one whit from continuing on making it so that more unfortunate occurrences of it continue to plague buyers who dont know what they may be headed for
 ie
see other reviews one and two star right here on amazoncom just possibly it might make someone who doesnt know what can happen and does all too frequently not mistake in buying itsome of the cds i lost back then are irreplaceable they were dropped from labels and not picked up by other bigger ones etc
in short no longer available some not even in vinyl if you can find them that is
if my review along with the other reviewers herein stop someone from sharing a similar fate then it will be well worth it
i was a first year modelbuyer when i got this and i wish i had been able to be forewarned it might have made a difference
and then maybe not
this is just a wellintentioned let the buyer beware warning and i see that i am in some good company as welllynnluvi purchased this machine a couple of months ago and have never had such lousy service
after loading the machine i hit the shuffle button and the carousel stopped the shuffling process after the third song
customer service had me ship the unit to their service center in laredo texas
we received a refurbished unit back in the mail
what a joke
i reloaded all the disks for the second time and the same thing happened
i heard a crunching sound and the shuffle mode did not work
i had to ship the unit again to texas and received the third unit
same problem
none of the three machines worked and they all have the same problem
i personally do not think the people in the service center even look at the machines
sony used to be a quality product
they obviously have all this crap made overseas and the work is all inferior
the service is horrible
this is an inferior product made by a fifth rate company that no longer cares about its products or customer service
i will no longer purchase anything sony
it has left a bitter taste in my mouth
companies like this should not be in business in america
i rate this company and its miserable product a minus ive owned this machine for  years and it has now sat in the box for the last two
i have only three complaints loading cd is cumbersome into the correct slotpossible answer is to create a thin slide like extension that can be anchored to the opening and provides a ramp into the slot
i should swing away into discrete depressions in the top
labeling is a painnot sure how to improve this
but there must be a more automated way like using wireless access to identify songs like on my media center server
it wont play some personal burnt cd with my playlistsive tried different type of cds and its hit or miss
it scratches the cd it playsintolerablemy final solution was to create a jukebox of my own with desktop computer and ripping music directly to it
this solves all four of my issues so i will not be looking for another hardware solution againsony cdpcx disc megastorage cd changerstay away from this one
unit worked until after the  day amazon return policy and then started skipping or not loading cds
the cds would play fine in other players
contacted sony and sent it to their replacement center
they have a great policy for warranties
you spend your money and buy a new product
they replace it with a refurbished product
after you pay the shipping to them
and the refurbished product has the same issues as the original
when you purchase a cd changer you at least expect it to play cds especially brand new cds
sony customer support recommendations are first to clean the cds and second to unplug the unit and reset it
neither one will fix anything
i am convinced from after the fact research this model has a serious design problem yet sony just looks the other way
i now appear to be stuck with a hit and miss cd changer
it will not load or play a brand new cd but will load and play one that was on the floor of my truck getting stepped on for  months  after sending this unit back to sony and paying the shipping i still have the same problems
i just purchased a yamaha  disc carousel and i am not even shocked that the same exact cds that will not load or play when they do load in the sony play just fine in the yamaha
imagine that
i will never buy anything sony even if they were the last manufacturer on the planet
i will now try to get what i can for it at a pawn shopi dont understand all the hype about tivoli radios
i have a model  and a pal and both of them have terrible fm reception
the model one in my office is next to the window
i am  blocks from our local npr station with uninterrupted signal path
i cannot tune into the station for more than  seconds before the static becomes unbearable
this is also the case with my pal
if you can lock into a station these radios have pretty good sound for such a small package
the retro look is very appealing and i bought them for the simplicity in their design and based on the reviews
however the knobs on the model one are very cheap plasticy and as stated above the fm reception is deplorable
these radios in my opinion are overpriced junki will continue my search for a decent sounding tabletop radio  but it will not include anything by tivolii wouldnt ever buy a tivoli product just because of their bad customer serviceno i dont own this model i owned the tivoli pal but based on my experience im offering my advice to stay away from tivolii registered my new tivoli pal and i had to install two new batteries at almost  each and then it died completely after only eight monthstivoli customer service refused to honor my registration as proof of purchase does anyone ever keep a receiptthey wanted to charge me another  to repair itas every rd review is saying the radio will not hold a station
you will be listening and the station will just fade out
you will retune it and then it will happen again and again
when i grew up all fm radios had a switch for this problem i think it said afc switch for automatic frequency control
it would make a tuner less sensitivetivoliif you read these reviews you could add this switchtivoli just keeps making this radio because it sells on its good looks but they dont address this problemi own a digital radio that does not do thisthe tivoli audio model one is nice looking tuner that performs reasonably well and sounds ok and i could recommend it if it was priced around 
at the current sale price of  this tuner is not recommended at all
the construction quality is decent with a very nice wood finish
tuning is also fairly sensitive but not more so than any other good table top radio
the sound is simply too bass heavy and not really listenable for talk programs
pop music sounds alright but classical and jazz are simply too fuzzy due to the bass emphasisif you can find one second hand for around  then maybe give it a try
the current unjustifiable cost is due in part to tivolis popularity in novelty shops and high end department stores that sell overpriced gimmicky gadgetsradio has poor calibration of frequency poor sensitivity
company just pushes cause its modelled after the klh table radio
dont waste your money on this nice looking but very poor preforming cheap chinese crud
i wont buy another
i would suggest sangean or cambridge audio but not tivoliive had this radio for about a week now and other than the cheesy plastic knobs it looks great and until today worked great
it just started to drift as others have observed
sure glad i bought it from amazon as its going to have to go back as defective
i chose this one over the sangean for looks and perceived quality
i made the wrong choicethis is exorbitantly pricedi had a very high expectation but was very disappointed upon hearing the sound of this radio
it is not even close to a hp or mac laptop sound quality
with these laptops you could hear many instruments especially on the treble side
i did not expect a lot of base for this size but the sound should be at least vivid
it is mediocre
though it is slightly better than a bedroom alarm clock radio
come to think of it
no cd player no remote control
man the price should be  max in my opinion
so one star for the price and two stars for the sound
the physical look is just finei have never returned anything to amazon but i had to with this one
thanks amazon for expediting the creditmy rating is in strict relation to the retail pricefor  its zero stars for  its one star and so on
for  it would be five star rating
the  tag price is unjustifiedthe goodthe radio is relatively small and goodlooking it has its own elegantly simple style
it is offered in a variety of wellmatched colors
the heavy wooden box  sides only does have its appeal and helps it sound more like an adult radio
the tuning dial mimics precision instruments and has a nice feel to it
jacks for auxiliary audio external power supply and antenna come handy
the sound is pleasantly deep and if one finds it too much it can be dampened with a ball of tissue squeezed into the bass port in the bottom or with a piece of duct tape plastered over the holethe badprice is outrageously high at  retail you dont get even a half of what you pay for
it is made in a large asian country famous not so much for quality as for super cheap labor and at this price it could be happily made in usa
the fm reception is very average and am is outright bad
the analog tuner tends to drift over time
the tuning dial is off a few degrees
the switch is hard to turn
its not stereo  at this level of fancy at least the phone jack could be stereo
the speaker outputs a continuous lowlevel hissing noise even when the volume is turned all the way down
i tried connecting external dc but it doesnt eliminate or lower the hissthe uglyi bought the model one radio for a friend in europe and intended to replace transformer in the power supply to make it compatible with  vac
when i opened the radio i found a lot of rust on the few metal parts inside
it was ugly and cheap
in fact i havent seen anything that ugly in any other new radio
with so much rust it would probably fail in a short time
i sent for a replacement and the second one had the same hissing problem but was ok rustwiserecommended
for  with no rust inside  yesradio shipped was labeled a v model and the enclosed north american power cable would not fit
it was literally a square peg in a round hole
the first tech suggested carving the cable to make it fit and see what happens the second one suggested just using batteries
back it went and ill be looking for another brandi bought my unit to replace a older sony stand alone
it worked fine for  months although the fm reception was a bit disappointing for my  npr station
one morning it juststoppedworking
i contacted customer support and they were completely indifferentit now sits in my garage a monument to poor quality and lousy customer service
sure looks good sitting out there though update
last july i got tired of looking at it sitting in the garage so i contacted tivoli and arranged to send my unit in for repairreplacement
for a fee  i think it was  but could be wrong they sent me a new unit that worked pretty well untilyou guessed it the tuner has crapped out on it this weekend
the fm band gives me nothing but static and noise
i wish i could give a  star rating for this colossal piece of junkyou have been warned about this company and their crappy radios
buy at your own risk
i should have listened to myself perhaps i got a bad one but i found this teleconverter completely useless
my equipment consisted of a canon d and the latest tamron mm telephoto lens with vc
im aware of the limitations as well as the probable need for manual focus
unfortunately no matter what settings i used tripod or handheld with image stablization or how well i focused the lens this teleconverter could not produce a sharp picture
i went as far as taking a photo with just the lens and then taking the same exact photo with the teleconverter
note i took several photos to account for human error and took the best photo from each series
i then took each photo into photoshop
i enlarged the lensonly image by  x is more like  so that the subject was the same exact size
even enlarged the lensonly image was easily sharper than the teleconverters image
so in essence this makes the teleconverter completely useless
like i said maybe i got a bad one but i cant recommend this item to anyonedescription of this product is incorrect
this teleconverter will only mount tamron lenses on a canon camera body
the instructions included with the teleconverter specification notes state this device is designed specifically for use with tamron lenses
it is not compatible with other lenses
this is in direct conflict with the amazon description tamron  af x teleconverter for canon mount lensesi am in the process of returning the teleconverter
it was very disappointing xmass presenteven though it is advertised to work on a dslr it will not fit the canon lens
i called the tamron tech support and they affirmed it will not work on digital cameras
it resides in the useless junk pile along with other stuff i bought on amazon that did not perform
the resellers advertise stuff that does not fit the manufactures description
too bad as the price is so low it does not warrant returnsi have a trendnet wireless router and like it
figurd this would be similar features minus wifiit was so wrong
the filtering options on this are the worst ive ever seen
this is pathetic
i am a network administrator and planned to use this as a simple gateway for a wireless camera system that has its own rf receiverreally useless
ended up getting an old linksys router and disabling wifi and installing ddwrti called tech service and after holding for five or ten minutes i got a rep and was told they would need tocall me back
i never got a call backi returned the routersays i can enable the router hardware firewall to protect me when i have to temp disable my kis software firewall but couldnt figure out howi called their hardtounderstand ts times
 but their clueless techs kept saying it wasnt necessary notbahhumbug
oi beg to differ with other positive reviews here
im using a mhz ibook with os x the operating system saw the device right away and it worked flawlessly
the sound quality however was much much worse than my home cd playernad ampb  w speakers
the sound quality out of the xitel unit was very close to the sound quality coming straight off the analog headphone jack of the ibook
my thought when i heard the unit was a few of my hard earned buckssomething that boosts my levels a little but sounds no better im sorry xitel youll have to do better than this
try at least to sound as good as a  portable cd player and then ill be interestedwont work in cd recorder as advertised
these are identified as the type to use for cd recorders mine is a philips cdr  showing the digital audio logo but the recorder would not read them
in addition while they can be used to record from a computer cd burner as can the cheaper cdr data discs at least half of them so far are defectivei bought the sony purple color packaging and they work fine
they have a slight greenish sheen to the recordable side of the disc and that is what you want
in the past i was quite satisfied with maxell products but these discs are a waste for those buying to record on a standalone component recorderthe question and answer portion of the product page states these do work in a teac recorder perhaps so but not in my philips same as magnavox so be carefuli needed the best cdrs available in a hurry so i went to walgreens and passed up on memorex sony and another less expensive brand in favor of this goldenfaced maxell cdr count music spindle
they were all coasters playing intermittently and then sticking
not a usable one in the bunch
amazon doesnt deliver on saturday or i could have waited
the  cdr spindle of verbatim discs that i had ordered from amazon came on monday
immediately i tried burning the same minute music file using the same equipment for recording and playing back the file
no problems
perhaps it could just as easily have been the other way around
nevertheless its somewhat like the restaurant business
if that first meal is undercooked etc the customer is hesitant to return
these maxells do have a somewhat embossed uneven upper surface to accommodate the fancy gold and silver patterns
im not sure but that tiny irregularity could be too much for some players to cope withi brought this to replace a very  old rca tv  with a corroded remote
initially it worked for my husband but when i tried several times later
i couldnt get it to worki ordered this and it said it would work with my brand tv however i tried to program it and it does not work
i would not recommend this to otherswe tried several batteries and tried on several deviceswe read the directions and followed them carefullybeing a name brand we assumed it would work but we never got it to do a thingnot one device even our rca tv worked with itit was so inexpensive it wasnt worth the time to return iti so not recommendthey last    months then you start to hear nosie and crakels
i have had to remove every one i installedinstead of using your nice clear landline connection make and take calls on a broken cell phone from the bottom of a sealed mineshaft
it will still sound better than your phone will sound with these things on iti dont know what phones these designers have but unless you have a handset from the late s these wont fit properly so that connections will sporadically come and go
you and your caller will still be connected but whether you can hear or be heard seems randomon other words this particular cure is worse than the disease
save your money and buy a headset or somethingfound out that it is  years old
driver install was painful
but eventually i screwed around with enough things it started to work
not even worth i never got this card to work
after installing the software it detected a poor connection to my home wireless network whereas my netgear card shows a very good at the same location
i never got the internet to work after messing with setup for quite a while
the software routes you through the xp networking wizard and other really unhelpful software
i would advise everyone to go netgear or something else
the range is bad setup is way too difficult and the product is not user friendlygood things about this camera cheap
very lightweight though not particularly small nice quality lensbad things in even moderately low light like a room with windows on a nice day the camera still needs the flash
without it the pictures come off blury and off color even with white balance adjusted
expect to take all indoor pics with a flash  ditto for outdoor at dusk
very little in the way of manual settings
if you switch to manual you can choose from some preset whitebal adjustments eg
incondescent flourescent and make some minor adjustments to whatever the camera judges is the best exposure
but none of these settings is available if you want to use the self timer
memory is very expensive
this camera uses fuji and olympus new xd memory
its smaller and not particularly fast
it also costs three times what regular digital camera memory flash costs
so tack that x  premium back on the pricei got an amazing price on the camera with coupons and such but im still returning mine because sometimes id like to be able to take a good picture without that flash look
you can manually disable the flash but the pics just dont look good without itgot this to split the vga connection on my tv so that i didnt have to keep swapping cables between my computer  xbox  unfortunately the screen is unreadable with this cable hooked up
every screen has multiple shadows and the colors are all screwy
at least i only spent this switch worked fine for me using an ancient noname lcd monitor at x
however when i switched to an nec  x screen one display kept twitching
experimenting it seems that the signal from one computer is leaking through into the other  the problem is only present when the not displayed computer is connected
this is only a problem with one of the two computers suggesting that it depends on the video card one card is an old but fairly highend nvidia the other built in to the moboanyway in my case its unusable at the higher resolution
unfortunately belkin seem to be the main competitor and my experience with them an old  port switch has been poor too
added later  the nvidia card later failed so its possible that there was a problem with the cardhooked this up to a dell desktop and an ibm tp via docking station
mouse doesnt work with ibm laptop even if laptop is rebooted
checked the manual and it says if you have an ibm or toshiba laptop it wont support both mouse and keyboard so use the laptops keyboard
yeah righti called customer service which has no tollfree number long wait time and they eventually just said yep doesnt support ibmwish i had sorted the reviews by worst first before buying rather than relying on the overall ratingwould no function with my old ms ergo keyboard 
sent it back
tried other keyboard laying around and noddaafter exchanging emails with iogear for days support it finally dawned on them that this kmv switch does not work with windows what a piece of junk
i am tired of having to restart my machine because this thing bonked out because i typed too quickly
apparently it cannot process too many keystrokeswhen i type quickly the iogear mini kvm switch apparently gets confused and freezes up and starts switching the monitor off then on then off then on in  second intervals
the keyboard is no longer responsivethe only way to fix it is to turn it off by unhooking everything that can provide electricity to the unit all cords to both pcshowever sometimes that doesnt fix it and i have to restart my machine which means i lose all unsaved workmy advice is that if you work from home avoid this at all costs
if you are in the middle of doing anything important and you type onetoomanykeys at the wrong moment your work is toasti got this device and immediately loved it
however i have a usb mouse and i used a usb to ps converter to make it work with this kvm
over time my usb mouse has stopped working properly and i have to unplug the mouse for several seconds and plug it back in
otherwise it does odd things like completely locking up causing my browser to go backwards and forwards and sometimes closing windows
so i dug into the documentation and found where it does indeed say that you cant use usb devices with it which make this purchase was a complete waste of my money
i suppose it was my fault but they could have made the usb  ps conversion incompatibility more eye catching
it is very interesting that their usb version of this device is almost twice as expensiveupdate after going through two usb mice i tried another usb mouse same type of mouse and the mouse has been working fine for probably  months
so im not sure if it was the mouse or the iogear deviceive been a netgear fan for several years
after trying belkin and seagate b wireless components and signal dropping to poor in the next room i loved that netgear components gave me a very good or excellent signal anywhere in the house
so when i got a tivo i thought id use the negear fa together with my netgear wireless acccess point
big mistake
didnt work on the tivo at all
to test it i tried it on my computer
didnt work there either
called netgear tech support got a pleasant young lady chinese i think whose english was marginal
spent an hour trying to explain the problem not sure she ever understood what an english speaker would have understood in two minutes
finally she gave me a totally false and nonsensical solution
she claimed that the only way to get a wireless signal is to have exactly identical components on both ends which of course is absurd
i later saw on the tivo website they have a list of compatible adapters and the netgear isnt one of them
my fault for not seeing this first
but this doesnt change the fact that the fa doesnt work and the tech support was a total waste of time
im sending the fa back and my view of netgear has soured considerablyi have a amd athlon xp  x agp capable motherboard  watt power supply mb ddr  ram
i got enough to make this card run great the only problem is the my card wont run at all  i was able to play gta  once at ultra high resolutions and it ran sooo sweet
but that was only once
i talked to ati and they told me to do a few things make it work better
nothing worked so i sent it to them they sent me a new one back
still didnt work it would freeze constantly just trying to start a game in unreal tournament k max payne nhl  gta and the list goes on
i am extremely dissappointed by the capability issues that it had
i paid  bucks for this card and i havent been able to enjoy it yetive had it for  monthes
im sticking to nvidia from now on
do research before you buy any card this pricei bought this hoping it would be better than the tecsun pl that i own
boy was i wrong
to be honest it picks up the fm and commercial am stations better than the tecsun pl but thats itmy biggest annoyance with this sony is the scan feature
i am talking about scanning the short wave signals
not your preset channels
first off it really doesnt scan it just goes up five and repeats
in other words you are on signal mhz
when you select scan instead of scanning through    etc it just jumps to  then  then  and looks for a signal on those channels instead of scanning all the ones in between
also if you choose auto scan it leaves out huge portions of the band and in stead just looks at the more popular section of the frequency
so instead you have to manually scan it yourself with a very cumbersome controli ran several tests
i choose ten signals that my tecsun pl received including the time beacons
the only channel the sony picked up was the  mhz
for this test i was in california
on one other signal it faintly picked up a wee bit
and before you ask i used the same settings and the same external antenna on both setsalso the sony just does not have the same whistle and bells and the ones it does have its difficult to use
for the money the tecsun pl is much better
plus on the tecsun you get the airline bandsif you want a very expensive radio receiver with horrible sound to pick up your local fmam stations then sure buy this otherwise keep shoppingi bought this radio a few years ago
i never liked it
i used it very little due to its poor reception and poor controls
i recently sold it pratically brand new for 
dont be fooled by the positive reviews
this radio is not what others claims to be
it has very poor reception on all bands
the display window is tiny
the light is dim and cheap looking
the design and technology on this item is not good
if you want the very best you can get buy the sangean x
check out my review on the sangean
i recently posted it on amazon
if you find the sangean too expensive anything from ccradio is good too
forget about this one
sure it is made in japan but not even that can save it
youve been warnedif anyone is considering the sony icfswgr world band receiver radio i suggest looking for another portable set
i read the reviews and then made the purchase
my main interest was to purchase a good shortwave radiothis radio cannot pull in the signal very well at all even after clipping an extension wire onto the antennai located an old grundig yb portable digital shortwave radio to compare to the sony
the old grundig is far a better radio then the sony
the grundig yb pulled in every signal and locked on
the sony scanned right over them as if they werent even there
heres a brand new sony radio and i am going to have to see if i can get some warranty work to fix the problemto compare the sound i will say the grundig yb is better
there is a fuller rich sound for playing the fm music
sony is okeh but not greatyou would think that if its a sony its gotta be good but the sony is a phoneycurrently i am only using the sony as an amfm radioi looked into warranty work and sony will replace it with a refurbished one that may have cosmetic damage
i didnt purchase this radio to trade it in on someones old refurbished radio
the cost to me would be the price for mailing the radio in maybe 
 extra to listen to swthat is if the replacement radio will work as intended
still taking a chance here
i am now attempting to locate someone who can maybe fix my radio
if not i will continue to use it as an amfm onlyin the old days the radio could be brought to a sony repair station to be fixed
there used to be one in the area but that is not the case now
getting someone else to fix it is not worth the cost as the total would equal the purchase priceappears with the mass produced chinese  products there is no quality control
you may get a good one or you may get a bad one
word of advice do not throw out the box right away like i did on trash collection daywith just a little more common sense and effort this radio could have been great
however i found it to be a huge disappointment
the first thing you notice is that the whip antenna is not securely attached to the radio and moves around loosely within the plastic radio housing
when the antenna is fully extended this translates to a  to  inch leftright thrashing
the digital display is invisible when looking down on the radio from above
this would be for example when the radio is on a table or night stand and you are in the seated position
the radio must be tilted back or you must look at the display from below for the digits to appear
the radio has a multitude of slide switches which are notorious for going open or intermittent
but the main disappointment is the tuning scheme used in the ssb mode
to hit the correct beat note there is a thumb wheel on the side of the radio that provides a frequency offset
the problem is that the adjustment or rotation range is about plus and minus  khz which is very course
this makes fine adjustment of the lsb or usb pitch very difficult
the range of the thumb wheel should have been plus or minus  khz rather than  khz
all in all the radio is just awkward to use
you wouldnt want it on your night stand in the dark as the dial light is very dim and useless
put your money into something with better engineering such as the aori loved this radio at first
it has a lot of bells and whistles and appears to be a quality radio
the earlier model lasted  years so when it finally gave out i purchased this model with the expectation that it would have a fair lifespan
it was treated with kid gloves sitting on my bedside stand in an airconditioned house and used for about one hour a day
after two years one year after the warranty ran out i tried to turn it on and found that keys were locked and  was flashing
i did everything the manual advised and then tried the sony online chat
i was advised that it needed to be sent in for service
then i tried email
they came to the same conclusion and added the link for service
no repair was available but they offered an exchange for a reconditioned radio at the cost of  plus tax and shipping
that is nearly the cost of a new radio
i will never buy another sony productif you want an expensive disposable radio with neat features this is the one for youmine stopped working about  months after the warranty ran out
a waste of my hard earned cash
replaced it with a samsung v
works flawlesslydid i mention the toshiba was junki cannot speak for intelbased macs but these cdrs have given me problems on all my powerpc based machines
my beige w external burner g refused to write them at all
my g quicksilver did write them but several times when i went to retrieve data from a memorex cdr it was damaged
my g handles them fine but the drive makes a horrid scratching noise that it doesnt with for example maxell cdrs
also i was burning them in joliet format for use on a pc which may make a differencewhen i called memorex about my original issue they told me my drive the g external didnt like their cdrs and that was that
tough for me eh
i will say they seem to work fine in pcs and it may be some problem with pioneer burners both the g and g have these
all the same id get a smaller package before i hauled off and bought a hundred of these if i owned a mac and especially a powerpc based oneafter using a pack of these with no problems i did not hesitate to buy another
sadly my experience with the second lot was very poor
i estimate that about  failed to burn
the failures normally occurred near the end of the burn which corresponds to the outer edge of the disk
as a result i will not purchase this brand again since it appears that they do not have good process control from one lot to another
keep in mind that amazons return policy is not designed for items that you use up over time
thirty days after purchase you are on your owni have never had a huge problem burning music onto cdr discs till i purchased these memorex
i am an avid amazon customer but i did not purchase these from them
i still felt i owed it to all buyers to warn them
had i bought them from amazon i would have been able to return them hassle free with the huge problems i encountered
regretfully i purchased a  spindle of these memorex cdr discs somewhere else and  out of  have been unusable and turned into everready coasters
i have a great hp computer with a superb recording drive andd also use roxio as my main recording source
over the past  years i have used many different brands from name brands to store brands and honestly never had problems other than the rare and random fluke bad cd
but here whenever i go to record my own playlist the cds have a mind of their own and will burn some of the songs but not all
like everyone else i thought it was me until i realized howe many hours and discs i had gone through
i tried burning through itunes as well as roxio and i am not a novice
i do know what i am doingso does anyone out there want  coasters
i wont even attempt using these ridiculously subpar cdr discs
and as one other reviewer said items such as this really are basically a  or  star product
if you purchase a  spindle pack and have  discs that may not work that is a  star product but if you use over  of them and  do not work as is my new score at the time of finalizing this review that is in no way anything above a  star product
please be kind to yourself avoid the hassle and purchase another brand
last note i found a cdr review site that categorized excellent quality medium quality and bad quality cdrs and memorex was on the bad list
and remember amazon sells the product but is not responsible for its subpar performancei finished one disc spindle of memorex cdrs x which all were burnable on my lacie burnertsstcorp cddvdw shl at a speeds of xx
i still needed more copies so i opened up this new spindle of  of these same discs both brand and kind
of eleven tries i had eleven duds  nine had sector  unreadable upon verification and wouldnt mount one had sector xx unreadable on verification and wouldnt mount and another sector  i went through the spindle dropping down about  at a time hoping to find a spot in the spindle where they become usable
both the spindle that worked ok and this dud  cd spindle were made in chinadecided to see if they would burn using my internal macpro laptop burner a marshita dvdr uj
i was able to burn  for  successfully at speeds of xx
they were from the same levels on the spindle that would not burn on the lacie
im still giving them a  star because of their poor quality compared to the first even older pack of memorex cdrsupdate  i have continued to successfully burn  of these cds using the xx speed of my internal drivealmost all of these memorex cds that i attempted to burn failed due to disc errors or other problems
the cds thmeselves had a strong chemical smell as well
definitely avoid this productall the other reviewers are in fact correct youll be lucky enough if  of the package arent dud cds
i tried the dud cds on four total computers so i know my technology is not at fault
the computers wil spit them back out in the beginning deeming them as unwritable or when it is close to  completed the computer will come up with an error message
do not waste your time and money
it literally took me one hour to burn two cds because i ended up going through so many cds just to get the job done
what a huge frustration and headache
please listen to the onestar reviews
we are not lying about this joke of a productand as far as ordering these through amazon the first product i received was in a huge box with little padding therefore the spindle broke and cds were everywhere
luckily amazon has a wonderful return policy
the next shipment i received was in a smaller box however the top clear plastic lid popped off but since the box matched the items size the cds werent detached from the spindleive tried burning data onto these from my hp  burner and the uj burner in my laptop
my kids also have a high failure rate on these with their macbook burners
theyre just junk
stay away from them
i have good luck generally with verbatim disksthese cds are the worst performing cds that i have ever bought
after encountering problems on almost all the two  packs that i bought i did some research on what a quality cd would be
it was decided that sony was the only cd that we could depend on for copying audio to cdr  other name brands that have better quality cost way more but sony is the best for the mid to low grade discs that we must have
with the last order i switched to sony and have had no problems at all
i do not know if memorex checks their quality but maxel discs have perform okay but sony is the best in the price range that we can affordamazon most of the  pack cds arrived with the case broken
you may want to check your packaging to be sure that they are protected
otherwise your service is okaystay away from memorex cdrs
they burn fine but will not play on many cd changers sony for one
if you have pioneer changers they will work but id be leery all the samethese memorex cdrs did not work well at all for me
i would not recommend themi bought a spindle of  as the price seemed like a pretty good deal
i tried burning  of these
out of that group of twenty twelve were dudsi am no audio expert by any means and there may be some great reason why they didnt work with my system
unfortunately there was no warning indicating that they might not work well with certain types of computers
the system that i am using is a dell that was new within the last few monthsi have also bought the verbatim cdrs and had very good luck with them
i would caution buyers to consider buying a smaller quantity initially if they are thinking about buying the memorex cdrsat less than a dollar per sparkly frisbee this is the best price i can find for frisbees
they dont fly very well and they break relatively easily but this is the best value i can find for  frisbees in one placea lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable cd media
the problem with that is they dont work very well for that either
i too tested this for myselfusing nero burning rom i tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs at x just like youre supposed to you know to be safe
it worked
it burned fine
then it took  minutes to open a simple html document on the burned disc
subsequent trials run with the verify written data checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning
its like writing with a white crayon except this is white paper
this persisted on several other computers with different cd burner drives and even different softwarei finally realized what great frisbees these things are
cheer up people they are great fun
so grab your spindle go outside and start chucking these things at your neighbors annoying dogi need to sue memorex for selling this junk
these disc are just a form of abuseabout the only thing bose has going for it is pretty packagingthe sound build and electronic quality is mediocre at best given its outrageous price pointmy sister refused my advice and bought this system
then i bought her a cheapo jbl powered sub and cheapo jbl satellites which cost about the sameand she was stunned
i just felt bad for best buy they had to absorb the lossi was unable to sync them up and try them out
my package contained two receivers
they are not marked the way to tell is the receivers have one phone jack the transmitter has twodont waste your money the sound of this headphone is very badand the price is too expensive to this bad qualitywhat is with the crazy price on these things
i have bought a bunch of them my last order for seven pairs a little over two hears ago
the current price is six times what i paid on my last order
and it wasnt the first time that i had bought them in fact i think i had previously bought them even cheaper from or through amazon
it may sound like they are not very durable but that is not the case they are fine in durability and excellent in sound
i just have an unusual requirement and go through a lot of them
plus they were so cheap i felt i could keep a drawerfull around like flashlight batteriesand now this crazy price
i reflexively give them a single star
actually that may not be quite fair
their performance may be competitive with buds in this definitelynotdisposable price range
but id need a very good explanation before i bought them at this price
i think i will scout around a little and see how many stray pairs i have lying aroundgarbage
not much else to say
horrible sound quality
i would feel bad asking my neighbors kid to listen to thembrought these as temporary solution before my headphones arrivehorrible even for this price it sounds like shitthrew away after a few minutessave yourself some troubledont buy this and go down street and get an ice creamplanetreplay the site that facilitates the sharing of shows over the internet stopped that function on 
the ethernet port still gets the program guide only
this is a big lossbad news  these players aparently suffer from a hardware flaw involving the progressive scan
many users report problems involving video quality issues after activating the progressive scan feature including myself
to solve please go to cyberhomes website and click on support to rma your player
unfortunately a firmware upgrade will not help thisit performs very slowly 
unfortunately this negative feedback is coming from someone who really likes iomega products
ive had their zip products for years really like their zip usb  mb drive and the mb usb  mini drive both acquired recently yet this one is going backthe problem im pretty sure is winxp sps support for usb  disk devices when attached to usb  ports
other combinations perform well
i have written several articles on usb  mini drive products here on amazon giving those products great reviews but not until i formatted those devices as quotntfsquottheres something about fat and fat formats thats in conflict with winxpnonetheless i was optimistic about buying the zip  because i figured that if it runs slow like the  minidrives ill just format it as quotntfsquot
however six hours after buying it it was back in its box i had given up in frustrationmy benchmark was a web site that weighed mb containing  files
no point starting small given my experience with usb  minidrives
well it took  minutes which was an awfully long time for a  device on  ports on a fast pentium  so i tried to format it as quotntfsquot and iomegas software didnt support anything but quotfatquot
not even quotfatquot
i saw articles on iomegas web site indicating that they dont recommend quotntfsquot for zip products yet they provide instructions on how to use winxp to do the formatting instead of their own software
its not point and click folks  but never mind because once i formatted it as ntfs this benchmark ran in  mins  secs
mb a minute is not goodbefore i packed it up to return it to officemax i ran this benchmark on my  year old computer which has win and some seldom used usb  ports and it ran my benchmark on the iomega  in  minutes or so but not before hanging me twice
not one to give up without a fight i reinstalled my iomega  usb  on the winxp computer and the benchmark data ran at  minutes
i was not at all surprised
by the way since you asked the benchmark ran in  min  secs on my pny usb  attache mini drive ntfs remember
using that as a standard the iomega usb  should have run this benchmark in less than  mins  if it did i would have kept itin summary if your computer has winxp sp and usb  ports you are extremely likely to have the same miserable performance ive had
please buy the product from a dealer who will take it back
and  dont be beguiled by reviews that say it was really fast when they copied a single mb file in only  minutes or so
that might be true but its not the way we use computersthanks for your timebought the wrong size and had to return the product
other then that im sure it would have worked fine
i only gave it one star because it didnt fit my productafter a nd try i received the same product
i left a detailed message about what i thought i was getting
i wanted the sizing of aaa and received aai purchased this product after confirming from motorola talkabout websitethat this cradle charger is compatible with mtr but it is not
it is actually an upgrade kit for lower end talkabout productsi cant return it as ive taken it out of countryanyhow the mtr comes with a wall charger so this becomes a cradlestandbecause arent stamped with the belkin mark in fact i bought two at the same time from these folks and they even look different ones shiny and the other is dull looks like they were just grabbed out of the nearest import box of the day and they dont work at least for critical applicationsim using these in a high speed monitor extender system that specifies cate up to  feet
these  cables make the system unacceptably noisy whereas other cables i have work perfectly
my guess is that these arent really belkin at all but cheap imitations instead if they are shame on belkin they look exactly like china made junk cables that have little or no twists in their inner pairs
i actually cut a cheap import cable open that was advertised to be cate and found that there were only  twists per foot on the inner conductors where cate spec says there should be  twists per inch
i didnt cut one of these apart because im returning them but my guess is id find the same
unless youre using these in a slow dont really care system stay away or be annoyedugh
time to just buy some decent belden cable and make my own stupid cablesinterestingbecause my last review wasnt nearly as bad as itll be now
i kindly mentioned before the headphones were functional along with the negative things i had to say
well lets skip the positive and go to negative since they felt the need to get rid of my last review somehowtook their sweet time sending it sitting in limbo for a couple of days on the trackingnot the item pictured
i expected red like the ones in the photo instead i got these cheap black looking thingsthese things are completely terrible for me
they dont stay in the earand actualy fall off when im lying on the bench  and the sounds is bad
stay awayi used these for biking
they were ok for a few days minimal wind noise but the left side just stopped working after less than  hours of usei bought this on seeing  star rating in amazoncom
it was pretty good when i bought
now i could not hear any sound from my right side headphone
very disappointed on the quality from sony
be aware when buying thisit is very difficult to see any detail in this binoc
very small view very difficult to focus
i tryied to use them on a shooting range
i can only see more or less decent with one eyei am buying nikonthis is poorly crafted
too bad bushnell puts their good name on junk like this
also it would seem to me that if a bino were tripod adaptable you would not need an adapter if the screw hole is positioned properly you would simply screw the bino straight to the tripod
also amazon should make their description match the manufacturer so both amazon and the customers would see that  this adapter is not compatible with the legacy  x  mm binomy first impression when i took this camera out of the box was that they forget to put the guts in the cheap plastic shell that holds this thing together
ive never owned a pro camera that is so cheaply constructed
it feels like its ready to break at any point and will no way hold up to the beating a wedding or other pro work will subject a camera to
it doesnt get any better in use
the camera is built on a nikon f a consumer body that has been jerry rigged with electronics from fuji
it features an itsy bitsy viewfinder thats like looking down a tunnel
the focusing screen doesnt have any split viewfinder for manual focusing which is an absolute requirement for this thing because its autofocus system is pathetic unreliable and simply doesnt work right
exposure is likewise eraticwith a lot of work and a lot of luck nice images can be produced
but if you want reliability and consistency forget this cameraalso dont even think about it if you want to shoot handhold below 
anything below that and i get blurred images thanks to the lightweight body and lack of internal dampening
this is the worst body ive ever owned for camera shake problems
i have the dh at work and can shoot at  of second with it and no blur
the fuji would produce a fuzzy mess at thatalso dont even think about using a cheap lens on this thing
it demands great glass
were talking ed lenses to get pro results
it also wants silent wave motor focusing on the lensesin short buy this camera and youll be facing an endless pit in which youll toss money for batteries cards lenses and backupbuying this camera made me appreciate my nikon fs bodies all the moreyou cant plug two of these in sidebyside the plastic surrounding the business ends are too fatthe item i received was ont exactly the one pictured
those received appear to be made of high quality materials with stout connectors
having a tight connection at the rca jack is important but these are ridiculous
its nearly impossible to fully seat them and when removed they pulled both of the rim pieces off my female rca jacks on my nad tuner
these things are just way too tight to be of good use and might damage your equipment
some cables are designed to be loosened by twisting the end before inserting but this does not appear to work for these cables
overall very disappointed in these thingsi realize palm is desperate to stop losing marketshare to micrsoft but putting several year old technology into a new shiny box isnt fooling anyone
ill give you the two reaons why you shouldnt by this
 no backlight makes this palm  worthless on planes dark places or in bed
i cant tell you how many times ive reached for my palm after ive gone to bed to check my schedule or add some note or idea ive just thought of
unless you like waking your significant other by turning on all the lights you need a backlight period
 mb is a joke
its  and i cant believe palm would actually put out a pda with only mbthis limitation really makes this pda not worthy of consideration
even though palm coders do great work minimizing app size just a few modern palm apps will eat up all your memory
no expansion mean when you run out of storage space after adding a few cool apps means its time to buy a new pda
guess what palm wants you to do thenmy cents as a longtime palm useri am actually a huge fan of canon optics
when i first started searching for a dv camcorder i looked at canons
then i realized that canon does not know how to make a quality camcorder
the zr series all of them suffer from tremendously bad audio and the mc is a worse model than the mc
actually the mc was probably the best dv camera that canon ever made and it just so happens to be the one that is discontinued
since i am so fond of canon photo equiptment i wrote this review hoping that canon would hear its consumers cries and fix thier awful camcorder problemsdo yourself a favor and stick with a sony or panasonic
they each offer solid audio video and featureswell here is an up date to my last review i know now not to by used canon gear no matter how much you save
come to think of it all my canon gear video and film and digital doesnt seem to hold up very well at all
yep no more canon stuff customer support from canon bites the dig one as wellthis little box aint so bad it plays my recorded tapes to my computer for editing since my pro grade canon xls that refuses to without eating tapes buyer beware
the used stuff can cost you more in the short term than you think my canon xls will cost me  to  plus shipping to get professionally repaired this little canon optura mc save me from losing what might be the lastof my kids sports games
so if you have issues with your canon xls or got burned like i did this will play then into your computer throughout the  dv inoutput cord although not the same resolution it will save your memories from being totally lostthis came apart the first time i removed the cap
it is glued together and the glue just pulled apart and i tried to take the cap offi wear glasses
sometime when i clean my glasses it cannot clean very welli see this item then i think my help but actually the hair of brush start falling down and when i use the other brush it make everything dirtythis was try before i clean my brother digital camera and it is good i make this trydry tip ineffective
i figured it would have had to have some kind of wet solution inside it to wash smudges
all this thing does is smear the dry black gunk that comprises the polishing tip
i got no benefit out of this item whatsoeverthe brush sheds like a labrador the other side is nothing but a shami circle glued to a suctioncup and overall the pen isnt that high tech to spend  bucks on
id recommend the amazon version to anyone looking to buy one
its got great reviews its cheap and it actually has prime shipping
i though this one did however it still took  days to show up
oh and the vendor for this uses usps which in my eyes is a way of pissing on the customer
theyre good at getting letters across the world quickly but packages arent their thingi dont know if it is dryrotted or if theyre all this way but the cleaning tip not only leaves black pieces of suede or whatever it is made of but leaves black streaks anywhere you use it
i rubbed my finger across it and my skin was stained black
returning immediatelyi watched the video read the instructions and this seems like it should be awesome but unfortunately results varies drastically
the felt tip came off after  lenses cleaning
the cranking cap that recharges the carbon seems like it contains nothing on the other end touched it with my finger there is no carbon on the felt
if there were my finger should have black smudges but it didnt
so with all that said all three lenses i cleaned with didnt get cleaned at all
i had to go back with a tec pad and clean it the old fashion waythis pen has a problem with losing its hair
had to seen my camera end to get the hair from the pin cleanedthis nikon  lens pen is a  replica of the item lenspen lens cleaning system which is sold here on amazon also
its so much the same that the general wording on the package and the plastic flashing on the product is  the same
i would save yourself  and get the other one  they are clearly made by the exact same companyafter a lot of researching and hoping to find a good camera cleaning product i purchased this
and it was quite a mistake
i have no idea how many hairs fell out within the first minute that i began using it but the pens brush is significantly thinner due to loose hairs
true i did pull these hairs out but i thought i would only be pulling one or two hairs out  the extras you know
turns out almost all of the hairs were this loose and no matter what i couldnt get the slightly longer hairs to disappear  apparently every time i attempt to clean my camera lens loose hairs will come out
this is super annoying and i cant believe i paid this much money for a product that is of such poor quality if the hairs were secure the pen would have been finethe  cleaning head will leave a light and uneven grey film on the lens
the brush is not well protected
it can trap dirt even it is retracted
do not waste your money on itwhile it seems like a great idea i was very disappointed in its actual performance
the brush is a great idea although i already have several of them in my camera bags
the other end that is supposed to remove smudges and fingerprints proved to be just about useless in my opinionafter cleaning two filters with the nikon lens pen i used a micro fiber cloth to actually get the smudges and film off both sides of the filtersas far as im concerned its not even worth giving away as stocking stufferive used cheaper pens that didnt lose as many bristles as this thing does
for now im using my giottos air bloweredit do your self a favor and try thesebelbvthey work the bristles stay put and they were delivered so quicklynanthe tip for cleaning lens will not last long while the brush is convenient for removing  dust and other fine particles
also good for mirror system
just dont  count on the tip  holding up purchase a micro cloth and air blower
i purchased a nasal aspirator and works well
also much cheaper than a camera bulbfalling apart
i cant believe they charge money for this thing
they shouldnt even give this thing away
they should pay people to take one and throw it in the trash
they should pay people for looking at this thing and skip buying it
they should pay people to forget this thing was ever manufactured
junque
they should pay me for warning people off of this tube of disillusionmenti was only attracted to this lens pen because its a nikon product and it had a bunch of good reviews on it
however when i received the item it was in a used condition although i paid for a brand new one from shopitaside this the brush works fine i use it to clean dust particles off the camera and lensthe downside of it is the tip brush usually aiming at cleaning finger prints and tough marks on your lens glass
when i first received the item i opened the cap where the tip is located
i applied it on my finger and i had a black inklike circle on it
so i thought i might have a bad copy as it was used
nonetheless i checked other reviewers comments and it seems that everyone is facing the same issue
so i preferred not to use it on my lenses as it can damage the expensive glassbetter use a microfiber cloth along with a rocket blower to clean the lensi ordered two lens pens to keep in the different bags and i avoided buying the generic ones for the quality of the nikon brand the disappointment was the black residue the cleaning tip left on my hand picture added which lead me to avoid using it on my lensesi write a lot and was hoping to use this pen to free up paperwork
the moment i received it it failed to work and i notified the vendor asap
the vendor was sorry for the inconvenience and promptly provided a refund and told me to discard the unit
i appreciated his prompt courteous service but would not recommend this pen to anyone unless it came with the supporting software and special notebook neededi purchased this install kit to replace the factory stereo on my  f xlt
it almost made it into the correct place before breaking
the install kit is plastic and adaptable for different vehicles
maybe that is why it is so fragile
the fit was poor leaving gaps at the top of th plate
i should have bought a more expensive install kitamazon was wrong as it said that this would fit my ford focus  zx
the site was wrong
when i got it i almost thought it was a joke
it is about an inch too short
if it fits your car it would be nicescrap is not the word i really wish to use but just to be polite this is just a non sense product i tried different combinations to give the product the chance to work it failed toi connected the output to my camera then to a recorder to a rf transmitter and not even noise or humm went out of this piece of scrapfor the price this is biiiiiggg  faili bought it  hooked a seinheinser mke mike into it and plugged it into a sony trv camcorder  and i cant hear much of a sound very very very very weak sound even at the max range of the audio channel
completely failshas no preamp and not battery powered so all passive
volume on channels has to be turned up so high that you barely hear anything and full of shhhhhhhhhhh white noisedont buy itthis is what i get for trying to economize
this speaker sounded harsh and nasal like someone talking through a box
i returned it and got screwed on the return shipping
definitely not recommendedi had my doubts about bic from the beginningstill against my better judgement i ordered this pos anywayif i could get away with it i wouldnt give this garbage a single starthis cheap brick blew less than minutes after plugging it ini got a refund and placed it toward a cerwin vega xlscafter all i need a center speaker that actually works
and like everyone else i want crisp dialoguemore importantly for me i also wanted as much inherent bass as possible in order to fully round out the effects of my sony subwoofer and front speakers
the cv supposedly provides all that and more but ill have to wait and see for myself
as for everyone else concerned stay away from this noname junkfirst let me add my voice to those who received broken speakers
not only did one speaker have the now famous broken tweeter which was rattling around in the box but the other speaker had a blown tweeterthis is unacceptable
its called a manufacturer defect and they really need to address the problem by pulling all of the inventory and inspecting iti had hoped to get a speaker with great sound but in the end it was just a waste of my timefor accurate sound reproductions these bic dvsi speakers are the bottom of the pitthey are not accurate at reproducing the voice and midrange tones and are very loud on the tweeter end of the sound spectrumi returned these to amazoncom the next day after trying them when delivereddo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buydo not buyi picked the box up off the porch heard a clunk and my heart sanklike another reviewer mentioned i opened the box to see the tweeter plate vacant of the tweeter which was rolling around inside the cabinet
from the reviews i was under the impression that bic was quality and have coveted these speakers for a while
now having placed a replacement order im hesitant to get my hopes up not to mention that these were ordered with careful timing to be home to actually receive themfrom what i saw of the cabinet it looked like a nice speaker im just baffled at the qc
i didnt even bother to unwrap the second to see how they sound
amazons pays the shipping each way  maybe after enough are shipped back and amazon says something bic will have a look at the issue
update fool me once shame on you fool me twicesecond pair arrived in a box that looks like it came from a war zone blackened with what seems to be toner dust all corners crushed tweeter rattling in the box
the ups guy saw me carrying this back towards the truck and the guy smiles and roars away
guiltyamazon  youre paying for this one again
returning and never buying bicthis didnt work for me as a combiner
i was hoping to merge two antennas in the attic to strengthen the signal and add local overtheair channels but its no different than with only the first antenna
im positive i have it connected correctlythis is a cable only splitter make sure you know that before you buy it
it would not let me see cable and have my ant hooked up at the same time bc of the freq range for it is too small
its ok i use it well on my other tv though just for the ant and another devicei was going to use this to replace a mix of modulators splitters and amplifiers
in theory  great in application  not so great
the result was snowy modulated channels and lots of interference on cable channels that would not clear even using a low pass filterthis product from amazon itself is not the cobra hata antenna but rather an unlabeled counterfeit of the stock cobra handheld nontelescopic rubber duck antenna
upon establishing this i did not remove it from the package as it will be returned
build quality appears to be adequate given thatpossibly even made by cobras supplier
i cannot be certain that the product is tuned for  mhz and will not be testing it
it could be absolutely any antenna in there
use it at your own risk
handheld radios out of necessity have to tolerate a bit more swr variance than the average cb but if the antenna is completely out of resonance it could cook your cbregardless the primary reason to buy the cobra htta is to obtain an antenna that exchanges the convenience size and relative strength of a rubber duck for the signal strength of a longer antenna
what amazon is presently selling isnt what youre getting
perhaps one of the alternative sellers has the real thing but as of the end of november  amazoncom itself does nothooked it up the connection was great turn the cb on and it was like there was nothing attatched
turned it a bit thinking a better fitting connection might work little boost came in
tried to see if i could make it more functional somehow and the antenna fell apart in my hands where the extension meets the base above the coiled portion
seems like a really porely made item that id have thought would have been great
nothing about teh packaging suggests its actually distributed by cobra so i have no idea who made this waste of time and moneyive experienced the same problems with the contact points not keeping constant contact which did not allow the antenna to ever reliably work unless i push it constantly at some angledo not purchase this everi should know better 
but in this case i didnt 
one look at this piece of sheeeet in the trash it wentdo not buy this radio should be a good one cobra usually is but this radio did not work when i received it i will have to keep lookingas soon as i get a credit for return i will buy another i think uniden this time i will see if it will workmy biggest complaint is that the local am stations are not tuning in at the proper number on the dial
of four regular stations in the area this radio only picks up two
the two stations i do get can be tuned in at the lower numbers on the dial and then again at the higher numbers but not at the number it should be
i have had better luck with five dollar transitor radiosthis radio does not have any oomph to it
my husband works driving a routein the city where he always has listened to the local stations that is until his old radio died
i bought this to replace it and all it does is emit a fuzzy static sound over a station
it sounds as if youre trying to get a signal from a distance too far
save your money this does not workhardly anything works on this radio
the shortwave doesnt work and the amfmbarely worksi dont see how anybody can sell this radioi bought this on the basis of the top review here and am sorry i did
the unit pulls so hard it has torn several tapes right off the spools and seldom opens by itself once the tape is rewound  the motor keeps hauling away at a fully rewound tape
it often balks at loading cassettes and balks at releasing them numerous time ive had to pry my tapes out of it with a screwdriver
not once has the cleaning button stayed down so this feature is as good as absent
i finally put the infernal thing in the garbage where it belongsthis device did not work  from the first day i tried to use it
worse it damaged an irreplaceable tape
i would not recommend this
i was going to return to amazon but decided to throw it away instead
please do not buy this product
it really does not work and it may damage your currently irreplaceable tapesnot a good quality product
i ordered it in may of  and now june  i am looking for another
there are very few made these days
i dont want another of these but may end up with it anywayi thought id splurge and spend the extra bucks to get a heavy duty machine
ive always bought the little  models which last only  years at best
this kinyo commercial rewinder was broken right out of the box
dead
nada
what a disappointment
on the bright side though amazon has the best return policy in the world
what a companyfirst off it feels cheap to just hold it in your hands
it lives up to that expectation it worked fine a couple times then suddenly decided it would not stay closed with a vhs tape in it so i had to hold it shut by hand for it to work
the latching mechanism wasnt too trustworthy to begin with but it had no problems staying closed when it was empty but that kind of defeats the point of the deviceafter reading reviews of this and other kinyo devices i dont know why anyone would buy anything from this companyi might of gotten a bad battery
this thing would not hold a charge at all
showed it took  then when used the next morning it was empty
again it might have just been the batch but this one is no goodmaxell your headphones are bad and you should feel badthe sound is low
the sound is horrible
one of the headphones plays music at a much lower volume than the other headphone
i am ashamed that i bought these headphonesi did not get the headphones that are pictured with white black and blue on sides
what i got is some ugly looking grayblack headphones but the problem was not that only
they sound ok for  but the design is very bad
the plastic going around your head is very hard plastic and way too big around the back of the head there is a big gap
the part sitting on top of your ear hurts a lot
you cannot wear them without feeling something pushing into your head
not even  is worth this pain
i returned themand as an audiophile and audio enthusiast ive owned many over the years both cheap and expensive
in short these headphones have a very veiled and subdued sound which noticeably holds back much of the music
even for the low money you can find much better sounding cans in the ten dollar range
i have a cheap set of sonys that cost me around ten bucks that blow away these maxells in every respect better and tighter bass and more airy and detailed mids and highs
this probably why i found these on sale for four bucks at big lotsmy head was too big they were too small and they were basically the same quality you can get at any drugstore or dollar store
not worth the effort to order onlinei found the sound to be sub par
no bass at all
the part that fits in the ear was quite large
way to big to fit comfortably in my ear
seems flimsy and not well madenot worth even  dollars
skip this product
nothing more to say
just dont buy this product
find something elseproduct is not what you see in the picture
bad purchase
i was looking for substitute for the way over priced sony ones and not the picture so not a replacementthis was cheap in price and quality
sound quality was terrible but like i said they were cheap and i was not expecting muchuncomfortable low quality
i bought them for the gym but they are so uncomfortable i just tossed them
didnt last one workoutterrible sound and a bad fit over the hear
the buds are bulbous
the cheap lt sonys are way way betterthese headphones sound very cheap and hollow
i would not recommend them
build quality is ok and they fit decently but there are better headphones out there for this stylethese must have been sized on a balloon
they didnt fit
they were ugly
they were cheap
waste of good moneyvery poor quality and poor sound
i bought this as replacement for sony mdrw they dont even come close to the sound comfort or quality
cant use them at alli put it in my machine when the error read head cleaning required
after i used it same message
not a fanwe live in town and still had breaks in the signal
just needed a portable radio for yard work walking but this didnt work well
return procedure was a  stari bought this small amfm radio to listen to the local baseball game when at work and on the bus
but when i recieved the product the am stations would not come in when i was downtown on the th floor of a skyscraperi have no idea why this radio will get signal at my house  miles from downtown but once i am downtown it has nothing coming in
i am thinking about returning this and getting something more powerfulafter a few more days this radio has almost no power it constantly fades in and out and doesnt hold a strong signal on fm and am is barely their at all if you are lucky
it also picks up a lot of other interference from bus engines and computers that it is located byplease listen and do not buy this product you will be just as sad as me cheap and not worth the cost spent it picks up too much interference and unable to refine tuning
save your moneythis is the third sony personal headphone model that i have tried and this model has the same problem as the other two
once any moisture gets into the jack for the headphones you lose sound in one ear piece first then in both
i just bought this model and used it for only two times
perhaps is suitable for indoor use for people who dont perspire
for outdoor use its a piece of junk like the other two sony models i have wasted my money onthe reception is poor
that is if you can even get a station tuned in
sony has a model with push button stations and  better receptioni bought this cd player simply because it was the only one i could find that was not too wide for my entertainment center
unfortunately its a roll of the dice whether the disc changer will work with the remote or notusually not
also its a roll of the dice whether the player will play a cd or not
ive had brand new cds out of the box not play at all on this player
ive moved them to another player and they work perfectly
sounless youre really desperate id pass this cd player byi tried hooking it up to my denon amp
would not work
made sure protection is on and still would keep tripping the amp to shut down
i think this cheap thing ruined my amp
looked up in amazon to return only to see it is out of its return date
what the 
  didnt know i had a certain amount of time to get a return for a defected product
i would have tried it out sooner
very disappointedso i have been through two sets of these now shame on me
first set failed about  months after installation so no warranty support
didnt even ask just figured it was a fluke and bought another set
second set failed before  months but i was not able to contact the vendor about it until it had been over  monthsi was told no warranty when i contacted tic
i responded with an unhappy letter and they relented agreeing to warranty the units if i paid shipping both ways
this was promising but it was still disappointing to have had two sets fail in around a year
so i spent another  to send the speakers to them for warranty repair or replacement
they came back and said the speakers had been in the ground for two years and they would not honor the warranty
no explanation of how they came to that conclusion they just essentially accused me of being a liar and then had the gall to offer to sell me a new set for a discounted price thats still more then they sell for here brand new
pleaseit was a disappointing and insulting experience buyer beware
if you look here a little bit you will find similar speakers for a little more money but come with a limited lifetime warranty
i am two years and  into tic products and i have nothing left that works
unless you want to replace them every year  i suggest you explore other options i plan toi bought one  never used it until  years later  had the hand grip break the first time i picked it up
vanguard replaced it and i stored until  years later  i went to use it the nd time and the foot thingie broke
i glued  put back in storage until  years later  i tried to use it a rd time and while checking it out discovered the top extendson lock bracket was broken  would not lock
thats  times in about  years i tried to use it  could not because something was broken
and it just sat in a corner all that time welled cared for waiting to be used
oviously they had production problems when my two unites were madeperhaps its my fault but my brand new camera fell off and was totally destroyed
i thought it was secure but it only seemed to be
im not pleased with it at all
the mounting is clumsy
i am very unhappy this morningthe coolpix functioned well until about  months into ownership when the lens mechanism failed and the display shows only a system error message
i suspect that because the unit designs to force the lens against the lens cap some damage occurs through frequent use if you fail to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on
this is a definite design defect
although i loved the camera for  months and frequently used it instead of my canon eos d this design defect basically sinks this unit as defective from the getgo
avoidhowever in this edit of my review i was able to fix the problem later by continuing to cycle the camera through a lens opening and closing and by forcing the retraction of the lense
i know it is hard to explain
finally the software matched the machinery and the system error vanished
what a hassle but it saved sending the camera backi thought a dvd case is a dvd case but the plastic on this product is so thin and brittle that the little tags that hold the front and back together break off on half of the cases
next time ill spend the extra money and hopefully have better lucksummary  a lot of the positive reviews are quite old
the version of the product that shipped at that time  was great and deserved  stars
the version that is shipping now is a pale imitation of the original
if you are considering one of these backpacks do not rely on the early reviews because the product is not the samedetail  over the last  years i have owned  of these backpacks
the one currently shipping see version  below is not as pictured
heres a quick recapversion   my original backpack  purchased in  or so  this version of the  targus gravity was well made and included both shoulder straps and a strap you could buckle around your waist
given the volume the bag holds these were very nice features because a heavily loaded pack in my case full of lots of books and a much heavier era laptop was surprisingly comfortable to carry aroundversion   when my original bag wore out im pretty rough on them  no fault of targus there i wanted to buy the identical model
i thought i had  they had the same model number after all
not so
this purchase was made in  or 
the bag i received was otherwise identical to version  but targus stopped including the waist strap
i was pretty annoyed at this but eventually got over it as i was unable to find anything betterversion   in november  my second backpack wore out
as with before i wanted to purchase the identical laptop bag
hence i searched for and bought the identical model number  the targus rg  gravity
guess what they changed the design again
they removed one of the two zippered side pockets leaving just the useless mesh holder that things will fall out of if you ever set the bag on its side toss it into the back of a car into the overhead bin of a plane etc
etc
etc
useless
also the interior materials are much cheaper and have a mass produced quality to them
they replaced the cool foldable document holder that would keep papers nice and flat and out of the way in the main compartment with a cheap velcro pouchthe stock pictures you see listed are for what i call version  above
ie
they are out of date and do not show the current instance of this backpack
if you buy the model now you will not get two zippered side pockets as shown but only onedear targus if you are going to change your product offerings thats fine do whatever you like but do not name them all with the same model number
its a huge difference to get rid of a belly strap and then get rid of one of the zippered side pockets on a product like a backpack
these arent mild cosmetic updates
they are fundamental changes to the products usefulness and changes for the worse at thatprosits really roomy ample room for my old brick of a computer dell  inspiron  and my tiny hp nc
good sized for overnightconsno compression straps when you have a smaller load to carryi ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker
not as good as ripstop nylonthe zipper teeths arent securestrong enough the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times
eventually the zippers all broke loose in one night even the separate zipper for the laptopthe mouse buttons are not buttons at all but long thin plastic strips
i didnt think much of it until my mouse buttons started sticking or not working at all
a  mouse works better than this super expensive one
earlier i also found out this mouse will not work with black mousepads even brand new mousepads
the mouse cursor stuttered and stopped while using it
you have to get a mousepad with textured colors
and when i first bought this thing the first thing i noticed was how heavy it is
it took a good while to get used to it and once you are going back to a regular mouse feels weirdwell ive got those for free since the person who gave them to me had my old paradigm monitors and let them get wet in the basement make long story short
i love music and music sounds better with good speakers
when i watch a movie those bose are not too bad but i have them hooked up to an onkyo receiver with a  paradigm sub and they sound bad
what a shame
my first and last bose speakers
who ever tell you on those reviews that those speakers are good doesnt know what heshe is talking about and had never listen to a good setthe mids are flat the highs are pitchy and there is no bass and even with a good sub they just rewin the music
i listen to a lot of classical and operas and the mids are very important but all that is happening is losing the good vocals
i have enough bass thanks to the sub but those bosecomon give me a break buy a low end no name speakers and get more sound
one more thing you need a lot of power to push them much more then good speakers doi purchased a older version of the sharp dv camera
i had problems with interferance when transferring to the pc
i checked cables etc
finally i emailed tech support
never received a response
better stick with sony or canonthe package that i bought from amazon included the avermedia ezmaker dvd pci card and a cd with the driver and the captureediting application called neodvdstandard version     l ive never seen such a long version numberthe pci card lacks component video inputs but is otherwise quite satisfactory
id rate it at the software package however was quite a disappointment
i would rate it at  in part because of the following specific problems there seems to be a huge difference between the better middlequality and best highestquality recording modes both in terms of quality and file size
the best mode produces enormous files more than  gbytes per hour of video
the better mode produces much smaller files but at much lower quality
there really should be an intermediate quality level between these two modes
one can set the path to the output file as many times as one likes but the program does not remember this setting ie one must specify it again every time the program runs
there should be an option that allows one to permanently set this output path
regardless of what one specifies for the total capture time the time shown under maximum capture time doesnt change
this is confusing
when one is recording there is no indication of elapsed time
it would be really handy if the documentation gave some guidelines for the relationship between file video quality setting and the size of the output file
for each video quality setting there should be some simple relationship between the number of minutes of video and the typical output file size
when i click on the tutorial button it brings up my browser netscape navigator  and i see a replica of the launcher interface with the text click on any module to begin
if i click on the capture button i then get a screen with  numbers in red circles
it looks as though clicking on these buttons is supposed to provide more information but nothing happens when i click on them
after editing an mpeg file to trim out just the part that i wanted i wanted to save the edited file to disk as another mpeg file but it appears that there is no way to do this
during editing it should be possible to speed up and slow down the playback
without the ability to speed up the playback it takes too long to find the chapter boundaries
without the ability to slow down the playback to less than realtime speed one cannot accurately set the chapter markerscustomer service is rather bad
first of all to get a pretty standard item for all wirelessportable product a car adapter youre going to have to shell out an extra  and this is for any of creatives nomads since they purposely made the input voltage a nonstandard one of v
secondly if you ask questions to tech support they pretty much just answer questions you didnt even ask and ignore the one you really want answered
i had this issue both through email and on the phone
finally during a phone call i said quotso am i never going to know the answer to this questionquot  the tech guy actually said something in regard to it making his call time average high if he looks for the answer
to get a replacement battery expect to pay around 
 for diagnosis  to ship it there and  for the battery itself
all of this just a couple months after its  day warrantyanyone considering a momad zen or the new nx model should find a demo in store and play with it for more than ten minute before coming back and ordering it   the players are ugly and bulky and heavy and ipodkillers
in creative labs dreams
these dont hold a candle to ipod in any aspects
in your hands it just feels cheap and ugly not the kind of feeling you want to have with an expensive gadget you plan to use every day
if you use it youll find good sound quality is about the only virtue
the interface is ridiculous and file downloads is unnecessarily complicated
construction material and quality are thirdworld class not the kind that gives you confidence
finally even the store salesman said dont ever jog with this
nuf saidwell you may not necessarily believe that with all the hype that surrounds bose these headphones would be anything other than stellar
they are unfortunately very subpar
in truth these are rather cheap headphones utilizing very light construction with a predominance of plastics and very cheap diaphragm materials
the triport technology is nothing more than a plastic shield over the diaphragm with three asymmetrical cutouts that capture the sound at different parts along the diaphragm
i suppose that this does help in making a very cheap diaphragm sound better but it is not a substitute for better materials and higherquality construction
i expect the triports cost no more than  to makemany consumers walk into the local best buy try these headphones out say hey theyre great
and walk home with a brand new pair
why is that
because most people havent heard higherquality systems and compared to what is commonly available at best buy yes these are a notch above
however there are several things you should know there are much better sounding headphones that are much cheaper the triports are defective
the headband design is very flimsy and is almost guaranteed to break after several months of use
i several friends who own these and their headbands all broke after a few weeks most of the phones to which these are compared are really terrible
the sony mdrv against which the triports are often compared is a very poor quality phone that isnt designed for home use  its designed to offer djs lots of bass without any regard for detail and clarity
saying that the triports are better than the vs isnt saying much at alli dont want to tell you that youre all wrong and that im all right
i want to say this use your own ears
audition real highend headphones before you spend  or whatever on these and then decide for yourself what you want to buy
you owe it to yourself to get the best when spending this much moneyhere are a few models that i urge you to look at instead of these sennheiser hd   and  pro
the hd  and  receive a lot of welldeserved praise but they need expensive amplification in order to shine and are in a different league that the triports hence comparing them directly is unfair sony mdrv
not the mdrv
these are very different phones
the mdrv is an older discontinued model with different drivers that sounds fantastic unlike the v which is very subpar grado sr sr sr
all grado headphones sound exceptional
the sr at  will blow the triports out of the water audiotechnica atha a and a
these are exceptional japanese headphones
theyre hard to find in the us but online you can definitely buy them
they compete directly against the triports and offer stunning sound quality for the money
theyre also very well built and reliable if slightly bulky if you can listen to a stax system
granted these systems cost as much as  for the headphones alone but this will tell you what a hifi pair of headphones should sound like
stax headphones are some of the bestfor portable headphones that will be used with mp players i suggest that you look atetymotic research erp eri shure ec ec ec and ec westone um sharp md sony mdrex and ex audiotechnica athcm and cmti koss ksc ksc and portapro sennheiser hd px and px and last of all stax sr mk ii which while hard to find and expensive  japanese street price is the best sounding portable available period and is the only portable electrostatic headphone in the world
keep in mind that it needs a minitomini interconnect since it requires the use of an amplifier which is includeduse your own ears
ive told you where to start research
please take the time and finish it
you will be rewarded with a quality product and you will be grateful for the time that you spent researching the informationfor questions please look at  it is an excellent source of information on anything and everything headphonerelatedi sincerely hope this helpscolor is way off  green tint throws off the overall contrast and the lens material is poor  too much distortion
got the neutral grey filter from orion  way better
celeston quality control has gone by the wayside which is where i put this afterwards
save your moneythis cable is worthless
when i first got it i put it in my laptops combined mm analogoptical output jack and it seemed to work great
unfortunately however when i removed the cable the plastic sheathing broke and remained inside of the jack
the product is covered by a lifetime warranty however considering that this failed less than an hour after recieving it i will simply buy a better quality cable
buyer bewareditto on the blue screen of death bsod reviews that ive seen for this product
i had read the warnings before buying but i have a relatively new mainstream pc that i have never had a single problem with and figured i would be ok  the price was righti installed the software which checks online for newer versions than what is on the cdthere was none plugged in the device when asked to by the onscreen prompt and the machine immediately gave me a bsod
when i restarted the machine would not boot due to a missing dll filei went through the recovery process with the windows xp installation cd took  minutes but seemed to repair the system perfectly and when i restarted the machine after the recovery i left the webcam plugged in
i assumed that the recovery would have refreshed any conflicted files andor drivers but soon after boot i later realized that this was when the install program tried to resume i got another bsodfinally i wised up unplugged the hardware and restarted the machine no corrupted os this time thankfully
the installation software again tried to continue and asked me to plug in the devicei chuckled and politely refused and it crashed soon after
windows xp crash reporting informed me that logitech had informed microsoft of a solution to this problemi needed to install the software from their website
i downloaded it tried to install it and got a message that my currently installed version was newer than the one i was trying to install
it was the last strawi had given this webcam the benefit of every doubtso i sent it backas mentioned in several other reviewsinstall at your own perilthere is something nasty about the driver for this camera
on  different machines the driver for this camera creates faults at shutdownsomething about not releasing control and being forced to quit by windows xp
install at your own peril
not recommendedi have never written a review of a product on amazon
my wifes parents purchased this webcam year  so they could skype with us
those poor people were sold garbage by someone trying to get rid of old useless junk by selling it to people that dont know any better
thanks logitech for selling crappy products in  and thanks sellers for letting people buy crappy products  years after they are obsoletevideo  grainy always greeni paid  for this last week  its definitely going back to the store
i used or tried to use it for skype and unless i held it right up to my mouth i couldnt be heard
there was also a terrible echo on the other end
by the end of a one hour coversation it had quit working completely
i had a skype microphone that worked fine until my daughter decided to play hannah montana with it and broke it
i wouldnt recommend even bothering this this thing when it works it works poorly and sporadicallysave yourself the money and effort buy a generic usb  reader from one of the major manufacturers for half the priceive been using and have been frustrated with this product since early february
sandisks tech support has been of no help they just blame the drivers etc
when they are backed against the wall they just want me to send it back to them for replacement which can cost me almost again what i paid for itanyway i can get it to work if i restart my pc
if i eject the memory card as they instruct i get an error dialog quotcannot unmount volumequotred circle with an quotxquot in it and an quotokquot button
when i insert the next media into it i get another error quotdisk refers to a location that is unavailablequot
i then have to restart the pc to use that memory cardwhen i get the thing working there is very little speed improvement over my older imagemate compactflash reader sddr that uses the usb  standard
transfering a mb file using the in device took  minute and  seconds
the same file took  minutes and  seconds on the usb  device
thats not even twice as fast
this test was conducted unscientifically using a simpletech sticf mb compactflash card
the timing was done with a stop watch timing the period of time that the file trasfer dialog was being displayed
my pc is a dell dimension  running windows xp professional sp
this pc uses the intel p chipset that supports both usb  and usb   the usb ports were not being used for anything else during the testfrom my searches on the web i have found that im not alone when it comes to problems with this device
sandisk promises much and does not deliver and is quick to pass the blame to others
they make a good product with their ultra compactflash line of memory cards
they need to pass along this type of engineering and quality to their other devicesthe first lens out of plastic bag can not be used
dust blocks light
how dirty can you getbought this kit for a celestron nextstar inch sc scope
most of these eyepieces are useless because the celestron telescopes dont have the quality optics necessary to take advantage of their power
the most powerful eye piece not lens or filter would probably only be useful for looking directly at the sun its soooooo dark
i joke i joke dont look at the sun without the appropriate filterusing these eyepieces in a celestron is much like mounting a power leupold scope on an uzi it aint gonna do anything for your accuracystay away
the thing has some sort of memory leak in the software
expect to reset the unit every  hours or so or else it slows to a crawl
it doesnt crash just slows downi found out toshiba lied with their specs of this unit
it will not support any sdio card other than toshibas bluetooth card
so you cant do any sort of wifi with this unit
there are so few accessories that you must accept the unit as ismy solution was simple  return it and get an ipaq h
it lacks the  touch recording feature but its smaller than my wallet and feels much more sturdy than the   it also has the full version of windows mobile rather than the scaled back one in the toshibatoshiba support was awful  they couldnt tell me if the host adapter cable worked with anything other than a keyboard  and that ended up being true
they tout the usb host cable as being able to let you connect to printers etc
all it talks to are mice and keybards
sickthe photo software that this  comes with is useless
dont pay more for itthe ipaq  is about  steps up from this unit in price but there is an equivilant ipaq not sure of the model 
my advice  get something with sdio now
drivers that allow you to talk to most sdio expansion cards out therestay away from the low end toshibas
i love the  though thats a real killer machinethe reviews that state this piece of junk drinks battery power like it is koolaid are  accurate
i am telling you i have never been so disappointed in an electronics purchase in my life and ive made quite a few i dont know what the answer is
pocketpc is definitely the way to go
toshiba has a nice form factor
but the first time you get data dump because the paultry battery has given out you will feel like you were robbed  especially if you are travelling overseas and can not return it
the only thing that amazes me are the reviews giving this  stars
these people must be writing the reviews  minutes after they opened the box and have not no way no how used it extensively
do not buy a pda until they come up with better battery technology
unless you just love throwing money awaynote i saw an article on the web recently stating that toshiba is test marketing a fuel cell battery version of its pdas in spain
that might be the one to get when its availablethe connectors on these cables are way too thick
they really dont fit on the component jacks on my brand new samsung lcd tv or my dvd player
i had to force them on it made horrific crunching sounds and i probably damaged my equipment from pushing so hard on the jacks and spreading them apart because of the girth of these things
as you can see in the above pic they cant fit side by side so the jacks are forced to spread apart
i have really never been so angry and i feel like suing monster
oh yeah and the picture quality is terrible
my svideo looked much better now i have interference lines
do not go with monster they are an outrageous jokethis is one of many monster brand cables i purchased over the course of my life and only recently realized that i paid about x what the product should actually cost
for many years basically from the early s until the late s monster had a brilliant marketing scheme whereby they trained bm electronics store employees to push their absurdly overpriced cables whenever anyone purchased an hdtv bluray player av receiver etc
the employees would tell people things like your new hdtv wont work without this goldplated monster hdmi cable or you wont get full p resolution if you buy brand xyz hdmi cable and other nonsense
there was once a time when goldtipped ferriteshielded magicimbued widgets actually had an impact on picturesound quality however with the use of digital signals all of that is obsolete
digital signal quality is not boosted at all by any of monsters technological mumbojumbo as long as the s and s make it from point a to point b everything else is irrelevant
please do yourself a favor and google all of this as it was a real eyeopener for me
i now try as hard as i can to dissuade family friends and other consumers from feeding the coffers of the greedy monster
please look at excellent alternatives such as monoprice blue jeans cable amazon basics etc and buy a product that is just as good or better than the monster cables for a fraction of the pricei bought this cable on sale and it worked fine
no better or worse than any other optical audio cable
the main problem i have with this cable is that it broke when i removed it from the back of my dvr
around the pin on each of the cables end there is a small rectangular piece of plastic a sort of a shield that guides and holds the end of the cable in place
on my monster cable this plastic piece came off under normal use rendering the cable useless as the cable will not set in place without it
bottom line avoid monster and the overblown hype and just buy a cheap cable instead
it will work just as well if not betterwhat other reviewers have said about damage to your equipment is correctas these cables come new the rca male connectors require far too much pressure to successfully connect with a standard rca female jack
with that much pressure you risk unseating the female rca jack on your equipment or damaging the jack beyond repair
this is without question a design flaw not a featureto safely use these cables with your equipment you must first modify them by widening the diameter of the outer conductor ring of rca male connectors with a tool
that is unacceptablei would return the cables but i have already damaged my equipment and risked damaging the cables trying to modify themthankfully i can repair the equipment myselfspeaking from real experience dont waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price
i bought a few top of the line monster cables once i got the top of the line sony xbr hdtv
later on i switched cables around with other brand cheaper component cables such as philips pts the hdmi standard owner by the way and also other hdmi cables even no name brands coming with my dvd player
you know what
i see absolutely no difference even under close examination
the sony xbr produces the finest pitch you can find on any tv
you think about what that means
stop buying this ridiculously priced cables and save your  and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list
digital is digital
dont let monster mislead you that their cables produce more   than othersunfortunately there is a grounding problem with these speakers
the center channel just produces static
i did some research and found this to be a common problemwhen i emailed creative tech support their answer was to isolate the ground looping problem in my house
im sorry but i shouldnt have to rewire my house to get some speakers to worki am not rating apples with apples as my model is gs nothing after the trouble shooting network problems for a small office is an internal affair and having your network and internet all come slowly to a grinding crawl over  days rather than something just failing is a frustrating affairthis device failed after about  years  i am somewhat disappointed when comparing it to the other devises on the same networkim thinking this was purchased somewhere else
it was amazons reviews that helped make a decision to buy
reading through these reviews it looked like heat andor a poor power supply would result in switch failure
placing  fan below and  fan beside kept things cool
a similar but  amp higher power supply was found
my switch failed last night
all  computers lost net
looking it up would tell me exactly when but it has been about  months
yes turning it off and back on will persuade it to function again
most people would agree that jumping up from what your using internet for to reboot a switch is not acceptable
netgears prosafe gigabit switches with  or  ports have worked wonderfully
this one has a problempicked up one of these and set it on a card table to play a  year old game age of empires ii with some friends from college
the switch was disconnected from the modemping times were between  and  ms which was excellent
everything went smoothly for about  hours
after that point the link lights on individual ports just died suddenly
new cables new laptops one literally out of the box yesterday morning everything pointed to the switchthis switch simply cannot handle moderatetoheavy packet flow
after repeated crashing the switch worked after power cycling for  seconds
all indications are that this product is okay for very light use
the three of us needed it to do one job and one job only
bottom line is that it failed to performnetgear is supposed to have a  year warranty  on the power supply
i had one of these for about  months
over the last months its been increasingly flaky every week or two it just hangs and needs to be unplugged and started again
it doesnt matter how much its in use its done it when weve been on vacation with minimal network traffici called netgear to get it replaced but they told me that its not meant to be plugged in all day so they wont fix it
unless you actually unplug all your network equipement when you are not actively using it i didnt think so then i highly recommend avoiding netgear products
update i called later again and got to someone from a different call center and they actually sent me a replacement
i actually forgot if i stopped using it because i just didnt trust the thing or if it broke again
hopefullymaybe several years later the original review was written in january  the product is better but from the reviews its not clear that they areits hard to get lowportnumber and nofan switches of good quality but i have had much better luck with thehp procurve g switchesi have
hp also makes port versions that i believe dont have fans that are more comparable to this netgear no management features vlans etc  for examplehp procurve g
ive used those in the data center a few times when needing a cheap unmanaged reliable switch and its what id get at home if i needed a port switch againthis was one of the worst switches that i have bought
none of the software that came to manage it worked
after many attemps to resolve with netgear i returned it with no hassles thanks amazon
i ended up buying a  netgear which works flawlesslyalthough the switch itself has a lifetime warranty the power adapter is only warrantied  for two years
our failed after about  years and netgear charges  for a replacement with is close to  of the cost of the switchthey had two replacements all got fried in thunderstorms
i havent had any problem with cheaper poe devices so i will claim this isnt very robusti got this to replace adlink gigabit switchswitch
it worked for a few months then the other day something went wrong  it stopped transferring packets  just flashed its link lights
resetting it didnt help
i pulled it from the network  replaced it with an older linksys switch ive kept around
discovered both myimac mylacie big network raidwere still unable to connect
resetting their respective ethernet settings finally restored my network but gave me quite a fright
thelacie big network raidis still not right  see my review of that gadgetid previously had a higher opinion of netgear
now i think ill stick to linksys ive purchased about  of these simply because they fail all of the time and ive been to date unwilling to mix switch vendors on our lan
some last forever but most die within a year or so
ports lock up or the unit will fail entirelythe bigger issue is that the lifetime warranty is rendered useless by their company policies and practices
first of all they force you to register your item online though i thought warranty blackmail by forced registration wasnt allowed these days so you can join their marketing database i supposeonce you register you go through the whole chat process
enter your serial number again all of your info and then be told that since its more than a certain number of days old youre not allowed to chat
you need to do a ticketso reenter all of your information again
your digit serial number etc
wait a couple of days to be told i need to submit proof of purchase
copy and pasting your amazon order confirmation
you could have forged that so that wont doin short a nice switch while it works
if you earn more than  per hour however your time will be better spent tossing it than trying to get a replacementother  nice metal case
runs fairly hot
unreliable and tiny power bricks that run hot
if and when power brick gets flaky switch gets flaky too rather than shutting down on undervoltage
has mbgbit lights as is pretty much standardi used to swear by netgear during my years of corporate it servitude but it seems that theyve really abandoned any quality goals when it comes to their consumer grade equipment
this is the third and last piece of almost brand new netgear equipment that is sitting in my parts closet unusedevery couple of hours it will disconnect all the usersdevices attached to it
this disconnect would last anywhere from  seconds to a minute or more
definitely puts a kink in large file transfers video streaming and online gamingi got a dlink gigabit switch to replace it and couldnt be happierdlink dgs port  desktop switchi must admit i prefer the build and look of the netgear its solid and the rear facing leds are great as opposed to the dlinks plasticky lightness but its all about performance not looks now isnt iti got two of these which worked fine for one year
shortly after my network connections would fail and i had to repeatedly restart both of these switches to get the network working again
a month later not even restarting the switches would help
another case of the blinking lights of death
i wont be purchasing netgear stuff againwhen connected to intel pro  series ethernet adapters there can be serious problems with this switch  inability to connect at gbps strange speeds dropped packets
generally not a good combinationthe device is very flaky
its incompatible with a lot of nics of the leading manufactures intel realtek marvell
i have two pcs with realtek network adapters and they both connect at maximum mbits
on the other hand my lenova laptop and iomega network hdd work just fine at mbsits a well known problem that is not mentioned by netgear in the unit description and because of this i think they are cheating customers
unfortunately for me its too late to return the device but you can save your money by choosing another switchmanufacturer
the compatibility problem is well discussed at netgear official forum for example here  encourage you to read this forum before buying the switchi purchased and am returing this product because the management application will not install on win  bit i believe the error was 
i tried the app version on the cd and the latest downloaded one both will not install
there is no web interface so configuration via this windows only app is required
i looked on the netgear support website and didnt see any mention of this problem and dont want to spend the next  hours debugging it so am returning iti read a review on the smart version of this switch and ill not be buying one of them now
that review said to buy one of these
dont
i paid for two they got super hot and flashing lights of doom till they would not start again
i ordered replacement caps after reading reviews on these
now one of my set of two works again
it still gets hot and flashes the lights of doom
the other just never worked again
if you want to try some soldering and buy some new caps
you might get one that works some timesupdated i find it very odd that some people are voteing these  star reviews down
by all means if you would like to waste your money
buy these up
if you like things that stop working or you love fixing defective products for netgear
this is for you
it amazes me how self destructive people arei installed this switch in a home network with four pcs and a networkbased printer
all inwall wiring and patch cables had been upgraded to cat wiring
i am an expert user with over  years experience setting up networksafter running for a few minutes all of the lights on the gs would start flashing onoffonoff once per second including lights on ports that were disconnected
all of the pcs connected to the gs would report that a network cable was disconnected
i contacted netgear support
this is apparently a common problem because netgear didnt even ask me to troubleshoot anything
as soon as i described the symptom they said theyd need to replace itnetgear offered me the choice of inexpensive ground shipping  to  days to receive the new unit or a very expensive price for an overnight replacement
there was no middle ground such as two or three day shippingthe replacement i received had the same problemthis problem has been reported by other users on other sites
given netgears inability to solve the problem and their ridiculous shipping rates to replace a critical network component i recommend staying away from this gige switchi threw away the gs and purchased a dell powerconnect  which costs  more but has better performance and includes free overnight replacement shipping if you run into a problem
the  has run flawlessly since i plugged it invery disappointed
i have other netgear components on the network that have worked flawlessly for years but this particular model does indeed have the issue many people have reported about disconnects
i could see how an average email checking  web surfing user would not care much about it but i use software for work that requires a full restart when disconnected so this switch drives me absolutely crazyevery few hours everything attached to it just disconnects as if they are plugged into nothing
sometimes it comes back up in about  minutes about  of the time i need to unplug the unit and plug it back in to get it to reconnect to the computers again
i am back on amazon to find a different switch and figured id warn everyone that this one is headed for the trash bin here
i still believe netgear makes a great product just this particular unit is flawed
funny sidenote actually disconnected me two times while writing this dont think it wanted me to warn everyone about iti have been gradually upgrading my home network to fullon gigabit and this little piece of junk was the last thing standing in my way
no morei have the gsv from a while ago and while i believed it was the first step to gigabit nirvana it proved itself to be the last step preventing me from reaching nirvana
when i removed it from the network i finally enjoyed all the speed id been paying formy nowworking network consists of anasus rtn wirelessn gigabit router a pair oftrendnet port gigabit greennet switch  x mbps autonegotiation automdix gigabit ethernet ports tegsg and anhp procurve switch g  switch  managed   ports  ethernet fast ethernet gigabit ethernet  baset basetx baset  u  external and now ive got gigabit actually working
when i insert the netgear into the mix it lies by telling me that its made a gigabit connection and proceeds to throttle traffic such that a gb file transfer would take over an hour instead of under a minute
badi bought this  year ago and slowly one port after another started going dead after about  months of use
now all the ports are dead and the switch seems to be in a continuous reboot mode
this is my first netgear switch and i am not sure i would buy anotheri purchased an gs v in  as a backup and just installed it this week
i cannot get a connection on port  and the port  light flashes when nothing is plugged in
the other ports seemed to work at first but other network devices were failing as long as the gs was on the lan
basically doa and now a year out of warranty
not quite the level of reliability ive experienced with other netgear productsfirst up let me say that the netgear products i own including these new switches have been flawless so far and that i am an amazon prime customer and am normally very happy w amazon but the situation with these rebates has me upset
netgear has rebates on all kinds of gear right now switches routers access points etc
and amazon happily reports the price after rebate on their product sales page
what they dont tell you is that netgear will only let you redeem two rebates regardless of how much of their gear you bought or what kind
im not trying to scam anyone i just want to get my items at the price that was advertised
 off an item thats only  to start with is a significant discount and was the deciding factor on purchasing this particular brand of equipment
seems like a strange way to build brand loyalty the price goes up as you purchase a third or fourth unit
never again netgear and amazon you could be a little more upfront too maybe say limit two next to the rebate pricei am unbelievably frustrated by this product
i had this connected to a firewall to connect two computers into a subnet
every  to  minutes the switch simply disconnects everything attached to it
at the switch all lights except power are turned off
the only way to recover the network is to power the switch off and on and then the problem repeats again in  to  minutesi tried removing each computer from the switch to see if that changed the result and it did not
i then tried to swap a brandnewinbox gs in as a substitute and i get the identical result
so the defect is in the units firmware or in its design but such a gross defect from a major network company is totally unacceptabledo not entrust this switch to any mission critical task
i had to come into the office at am on sunday night to debug this and find a reliable temporary substitutethis netgear product is very well known for blowing two internal capacitors within  mos
of purchase
just google gs  blinking lights and you will find a long list of hits
mine failed christmas morningif you do buy it go ahead an buy a soldering iron and some capacitors so you can fix it when it fails on you toono more netgear for meover the years ive purchased many netgear but in the last three it seems i have port failures on new equipment frequently
my  month old gs died a horrid death one day i kept it on a mondo surge suppressor and have pretty high quality power anyways
at any rate ive had other netgear failures originally consumer quality so i started purchasing the pro line thinking it would be better
not so muchmy advice avoid the brand  they have quality issuesby the way talked to tech support and the person told me that the problem was using a surge suppressor
he wanted me to plug it directly into the wallhonestly i think they would have replaced the device free of charge my problem is that their products keep dying
better to pay for a product that will last  years then get another defective product albeit free
ive switched to dlink ive had good longevity at a work site with their productsi bought one of these and it worked fine
about  years in the switch failed and since i could not have my network down for several weeks while netgear solved this issue i bought another one and then wrote to netgear for a credit of some sort indicating that i could send the defective switch to them and that i would like compensation for the new unit i had to buy
they not very promptly got back to me and pointed out that they would only repair or replace with a reconditioned unit the defective switch not replace it with a new one or a refund for a purchased unit
remember my premise here  if the switch goes down you network is down
so while you are waiting weeks for shipping and repairreplacement you are simply out of luck
too badnow i suggest that a warranty of this sort is pretty much useless so in effect you really dont have a warranty at all
if you have a network that you can tolerate being down for weeks you probably dont need a network
on top of that i dont think that a network switch should fail this quickly  this is rather routine technology that at this point in its evolution should be rock stable
so comparatively short life  useless warranty  one star
next time linksysworked great for about one year
then the flashing green lights of death that others have documented started
just thought id add my vote to avoid this product
update to review i originally bought these in march of  the first one died in september  the second one died december of  the second failure wasnt as obvious and sat off in an office
the failure mode brought our entire network to a crawl until we found the culprit and unplugged it
i noticed on netgears web site that prosafe products purchased after may of  have  a lifetime warranty
leads me to believe they must know they built and sold most of the junk prior to may and dont want to correct their problem for those of us who bought back then
that tells me all i need to know about netgear
its on to dlinkthe switch failed after only a few months of operation
i was using this switch to route video from ip cams in the house
find a better product
this is the nd identical switch to fail
not an isolated incidentit seemed like the best deal out there
 gig ports for a great price
i own two of these bought them together
wish i could send them back and netgear just wont have anything to do with them
within a couple months they were locking up dropping connections
i personally think its because these are fanless and seem to overheat very quickly
i am amazed that netgear thinks that a switch should be unplugged when not in use a network switch is always in useas far as performance goes these switches are unable to sustain anything over mbps
i am going back to linksys
was getting over mbps sustained and never a lock up with even the cheapest linksys switchjunk absolute junk
dont even try to complain to creative
talk about a bunch of losers
if you have a soundblaster already installed you might as well reformat to get the new one to work
i am a computer engineer for crying out loud
the soundblaster uninstall does not work and you can spend forever trying to track down all the files that need to be deleted so that your new card will install correctly but you will never find them allthis is stranded cable not solid therefore it doesnt work for in the wall installation
there is no mention  of which type this is in the description
it works fine for patch cables though
definitely not an installation kit lots of geewhizzy d and lighting effects and huge library of objects allows you to embed a cabinet or other furniture into a wall half in one room half in another
doesnt understand the concept of quotsolidquot treats some objects doors as measured on center while others are measured to their edge windows particularly the height of the window above the floor to move an entire room you have to move each and every little object that makes up that room
painfully difficult to select all of the objects that make up a room no convenient wizards to walk you through entering existing data about your house to speed the process of replicating it nor any convenient wizards to then ask what it is that you want to change and help guide you help system is oversimplified and limited to just basic concepts behind the software not the details on how to use itconclusion it may be very powerful in the hands of the people who wrote it but it lands frustratingly in the middleground between what a diyer should buy and what a professional architect would use likely autocadthis software is ok but its not worth the money
it does a terriable job with roofs wont calc
rafter and jack sizes on a hip roof
finding stuff is really hard
i cant find roof vents
took me forever to get used to the user interface and im an advanced pc user
cant find where you can add an overhand on a roof  to much to listbuy a linksys router instead
the dlink product concept is good
a wireless router with a print server built in
i can hard wire my pc for broadband at my desk as well as use my laptop anywhere in or outside the house 
with this set up i can surf the net with both computers at the same time with one internet connection
the plus is that i can also use the printer with both computers
the problem is that i have been unable to connect to the internet with this router
tech support is clueless as to the problem
i have spent several days on the phone trying different scenerios without luckthe concept is great but the equiptment is uselessbuy linksy great equiptment ran flawlessly and great tech supportthese cameras start out life ok good actually but then the dark side comes out and that is the horrible lens drive system
the gears go bad and repair is only temporary even by kodak
i repair these products for a major service company and the design is just plain bad
dont think you can get a cheap one on ebay either to fix yours they all have the same problems
toss it and buy something elsemy ls camera worked fairly well for about   years and then all of a sudden it would not take any pictures
everything in the video display window was black  if you snapped a photo  it was also black
i contacted tech support and learned that they would take the ls back and for a mere  exchange it for a dx
why in the world would i chance another kodak camera
never again
this was not a great camera to begin with but to have a camera simply die that was not overused nor abused is simply unacceptable
does kodak care
not a bit  there will be others who buy their product based on the reputation of the company
well i hope this review informs you that that reputation is not so welldeservedi ditched my am speakers through ebay and bought some good speakers instead
anyone who likes bose must only have their clock radio as a point of reference
i was able to sucker some chump into paying  for my bose am speakers which i turned around into a set of athena  speakers and a  velodyne sub
all running from the same pioneer vsxd av receiver as the bose
my new speakers set me back about  leaving money left over for speaker wire and standsso why am i so harsh on the bose am speakers
well they do look nice but they use proprietary speaker wires with speacial plugs
so you have to use their wiring which really reduces the options for running wiring for the back surrounds
the small size is nice but having speaker wire hanging out in plain site pretty much sucksspeaking of sucking lets adress the major shortcoming of almost all bose products they just dont sound good
my budget athena  speakers have a  tweeter and a  driver
this combo does a pretty good job of covering down to around hz where the sub fills in
not completely flat but really nice for the price and signficantly better than what the bose am can do with its single  driver per speaker
the velodyne sub can hit hz and really fill in the low end while the bass module i refuse to call that bose thingy a sub doesnt get any where near that
and since all  speakers are cabled through the bass module youre really stuck finding a good place to hide it in your roomso what does all this mean
when watching a dolby digital or dts movie i can now actually notice the low frequency effects and even feel them
with the bose you get muddled farting from the bass module and i suspect the cross over on the bass module is set pretty high in an attempt to compensate for the bose cubes misserable low to mid range response so you know where the sound is coming from sort of distractingthe overall sound stage is now much better with the new speakers too
the bose cubes were too easily localized and didnt fill in the room very well
but most important when watching a movie we can now actually hear the dialog
with the bose am it seemed like the music sound track and other ambiant sounds were constantly overwhelming the dialog
turns out this was due to the fact that crappy little cube speakers arent able to effectively produce sound in that low to mid frequency range where most dialog lives
take a look at all the traditional center channel speakers everyone else sells they usually feature a single tweeter and two or more midrange drivers of decent size  to  depending on cost
now compare that to the single  driver found in the bose cube center channel
which one do you think will do a better job of reproducing the full frequency of sound needed to enjoy a moviesorry to ramble a bit but i was a chump when i fell for the bose marketing hypebs
now that ive learned that i can get significantly better sound for  the cost and im sure there are scores of other options id hate to see someone else get suckered in by the hype
so go back to amazons speaker section and try something else athena is a great brand and im sure there are lots of other choicesive skimmed through other reviews here checking to see if the problems ive been having with mine were common and if there was a workaround that someone had notedalas this is not to besummary the battery life sucks
really
sucks
connection problems all over the map
im in the middle of using the bloody mouse after putting in new batteries and it ceases to move
just dies no reason no form and the workaround for this is to remove the device and readd it
for  i think not
authentication failures
i get them all the time
often the only way to solve my problems is to plug in a corded keyboard and mouse  and if im going to do that  times i suppose i should dump the productif i could give this product a negative number for stars i would
its horrible its a beast on battery life its certainly not for new comers to computers and windows and bluetooth its bluetooth adapter certainly doesnt work with most devices none thati have and to boot it messes with my bluetooth adapter that i had to buy to solve that first problem
i like the idea of secure wireless connections but surely microsoft can do better than thistoo bad i cant sue for damages and the waste of hours of my lifei have had this keyboard for over  months and am very disappointed
my first one simply stopped working
microsoft replaced it without a fight
the second one  is  now having problems such as the space bar putting in two spaces instead of one
this is a real hassle when you  realize how often you  use the space bar
the range on  the bluetooth is limited and that causes some problems
sometime it doesnt work even though are only inches away
the mouse is has the biggest problem with distance
the keyboard seems to shut itself off if it isnt used for a few minutes
then you type and nothing happens for  about  keystrokes
that is anoying and time consuming
finally it took quite a while to get this to  work with  the builtin bluetooth transmitter for dell
it works but it  took hours to get it  working
who wants a bid microsoft transmitter sticking  out of your computer when  you already bought a  computer with it built in
the keyboard has lots of nice features but the downsides are simply too many
i will be replacing this keyboard soon with something else even if i  have to go back to  a wired modelwhen i first got this i thought it was the ultimate
however it stops working all the time
to get it working again you need to read four microsft knowledbase aricles and uninstall  reboot reinstall the software
about  minutes worth of work
if you need something to do for  minutes every single week then you can afford the time it takes to keep this runningwe have the same setup at work and have the same problems there
so it is clearly a flaw in the productbought these for my sons mp player
they worked great for about a week then one of the wires came loose and they were dead
try explaining that to a  year oldi would not recommend themthese are very flimsy and the volume control doesnt work well
i wanted to use this to listen to television but the volume is far too lowno dont waste your money poor music quality was very unsatisfied once purchased a different model was much much happrier even spent less and a lot better music sounds from the same resource
ended up returningthe product description says reliable l plug for improved durability and reliability plug on the one i received is straight
the picture also shows an lplug
the ones i received has a straight plug
why is this important
because straight plugs are notorious for defects and guess what i have no sound in the right earphone after one use
i had to request a refund as the sound is horrible when you can only hear it form one side
these are very cheaply made i guess they stopped making the version everyone rated as  starsthe best sounding junk phones ever made that will last less than  day and short outi have spend over  this year for headphones but these are perfect for great sound and far better than i expected for sound only
i think youll need to spend  bucks to get betterthese are cheap top trashi called to warrantee and the guy said this was a joke number given on the package i dialed the number again and he got angry
this is not a real deal just a fake number
i just sent them back for a replacement and i will get another  weeks phone and then return them for a refund when they short outdo not buy these if you plan to need them to work for mopre than  weeksi plugged these headphones into two sourcesa computer and a high quality boom box
i made certain that on both trials that the plug was pushed in all the way as if you dont the result can be mono sound
no sound comes out of the left side
i tried and tried
i even looked on the headphone set and the inline volume control to located a balance left and right controlthe plus about these headphones is that they are very light weight and they come with an additional adapter which allows the user to convert from  plug to  plug as it is commonly referred to
another plus is the brand name koss but what went wrong here
at least these were my findings
i was always able to get proper sound out of other headpones on the two above deviceseven with extension cables
another plus is the volume controlthe integrated adjuster knob slides easily in both directions and allows the user to go from mute to very loud
the koss inline volume adjuster that was offered as a group purchase with this itemwouldnt allow a complete mute or that significant of a raise in volumeat leastthat was my experience
the adjuster knob protrudes enough to make it easy to locate by touchunlike on the inline only volume adjuster mentioned above
these headphones also have a gellike blue material that makes contact with the top of your head and this adds to the comfort
 post scriptupdateafter i submitted the above review indicating no sound was coming out of the left ear piece i removed a  foot  extension cord which i had incorporated into the separate connecting of these headphones to my computer and boom box
without the utilization of the  foot extension cable sound came out of both left and right sides of the headphones
however ive been using this same  foot extension cable with my sony headphones and sound comes out of the left  right sides of those headphones
the cable is only one week old
when i connected the sony headphones to run a test they worked
evenin the pastwhen ive used  foot extension cables for headphonesthis did not affect the functionality of the headphonesi would have liked for those headphones to have workedbut my experiences were not positive with themquite the oppositewhen i first got these   sets i though that they were real nice for the money happens that after just a few mounts they all are broken
my wife and i are seniors and not rough on anything we use these for listening to the tv what happened with two of them is that the real thin wires going into the headset broke and only one side of the of the phones work the third one the plastic broke right above the ear piece
for just a few months of use these are not worth the moneywell where do i start they dont fit well i am constantly adjusting them to keep them on my head since koss has a lifetime warranty i had to replace them twice that is three headphones within a year
i lost sound in the right one on the first purchase then the left one then the plug wentnot sure if they just gave me a refurbished headphone when i replace it the nd and rd time
save yourself the headache try another headphone
i dont know what is going on with the quality of products but i have had headphones for my other players in the past that worked great
i guess i will keep lookingi am sure this is a good product but the one i brought did not work properly
it could read and write compact flash and smart media cards but when i inserted a memory stick or a secure digital card i was always prompted to insert a disc in the drive
that is it did not recognize the latter formatsthis must be a sample defect but it was disappointing and i returned the drivebought several years ago
had it in bedroom on side table
rarely used
it still looks like it came out of box
alarm feature okay sound was good
suddenly would not power up
called crane attendant advised to try this and that
still not powering up
only option send it in for repair for a mere  plus i pay the shipping to them
not happy camper here
if crane doesnt stand behind their products better than business will not stand by them
save your money and buy a sony
very unhappydishonorable company
worthless product
i will never trust ccrane or sangean ever again and you shouldnt eitheri just threw this annoying waste of  in the trash  minutes ago
of course the lcd stopped working just after warranty ran out that was years ago
my disgust at ccranes nonresponse to their flimsy product has smoldered ever since
i used the radio occasionally but you can feel yourself aging while you try to dial in blind
the backlight randomly goes on and off
the preset buttons will trigger buttons next to the one youre pushing then fail to memorize the station youre on requiring irreplaceable minutes to make another blind dial intonight was the final straw
the weatheralert alarm woke my wife and i up at am for a freezing drizzle alert even though i did not have the weather alert button activated red
thats right the damnable thing will now blatter out its weather alarm beeps whether i want it to or not like a thing possessedim embarrassed to have been suckered into buying ccrane and sangeans worthless radio
do not trust ccrane to do anything except take your money to their bank and make you feel like a sucker when you callas my other reviews show im easy enough to get along with and dont expect the world from cameras radios etc
but i do expect them to do something for the price and this didnt
i bought one from c crane five or six years ago and had the typical complaints that have been voiced here  poor am performance when great was advertised and the mysterious lcd fade outwere talking metro ny here it could only sporadically pick up wcbs in parsippany
that sounds like a seinfeld line but its truemy  garage salew bought thompson ge did better in bergen countynow since youre reading the reviews which by the way ive never seen so many    star reviews for any product on amazoni will make a recommendation the etone e which is what this was supposed to work like and didnt
and save  or save  and get an fr or get that in camaflouge and save but get something other than this
luckily i lost mine a couple of years ago so its not around to annoy mei bought this unit when it was advertised endlessly on the art bell show
c crane claimed exceptional am reception even though their website pushed an external am antennae for this
 claimed the speaker bought out true lifelike sound of the human voice and took many many years to develop this dependable unique radio
all claims are false
first i live in an open area just west of minneapolis
am reception for local am stations was static or so picky that you would have to move the radio constantly
i ran it on batteries and drove to different locations within  miles of my house
same problems
i bought the external am antennae it cleared up a bit but not as advertised
they claimed the speaker bought out lifelike human voice it does not
its a standard speaker you could find at radio shack no special basstreble boost for clearer am sound
finally lets talk reliability
i bought one unit for myself and one for my mother a week later
after one year both units lcd displays became unrecognizable
certain bars of the lcd were unreadable and others were stuck
it became impossible to locate a station by number
i am furious and extremly disappointed with all the hype c crane company placed on this product
i do not trust them or any of their productscc radio needs to get their st together and produce a radio that isworthy of the cost
sticky buttons bad lcd readout and poor customerservice
buy something else
anything else
blpaying only  for a mb stick of ram would be too good of deal well it was tried everything reseating running on its own and so on with the same results pc would not boot because of hardware failure  ramavoid cheap deals unless you can find someone out there that has high marks which usually results in high standardsthis may in fact be a fantastic video capture card
i purchased it because i wanted something cheap to transfer a couple things from vhs
silly me i assumed that had standard rca video in and two sound channels that just happened to all be colored yellow
nope
the yellow here is all video component video
the nonyellow is svideo
if you want audio youll have to do that some other way not with this cardshort story  if you want something inexpensive that is just going to work on modern systems that also comes with decent software go with something like avermedia c dvd ezmaker   thats what i got to replace this and its exactly what youd expect and it has a usb interface with cyberlink software
yay
i ate   shipping on this ancient card and i dont even plan on trying it out
maybe someone on an auction site wants itthis product did not work at all and with multiple ethernet cables and computers
i believe all the ports where badlinksys appears to be riding on their reputation
during the s their stuff was top notch and we bought nothing but linksys
then they were purchased by cisco and their quality appears to have nosedived since thenwe had the exact same experience as another poster with indicator lights remaining on after the plugs were pulled from the corresponding sockets and within a day the whole unit diedweve stopped buying ciscolinksys and found netgear products to be what linksys used to be well made at attractive prices
id suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear insteadthese switches are unstable
wiggle a wire and half of the switch will crash
may work fine for months at a time then partially crash  when crashed some ports still work while others dontnot worth the troubledied today after under  years of service
thats pretty terrible for a basic piece of equipment
i have switches from  years ago that still work finehad to reset the switch fairly oftenevery  months or so
drove me nuts making me think our dsl modem or cisco router was buggy
would work for a while and then just stop passing trafficbuy from someone elsepicked up a pack of these exact same cdrs after running out of philips ones which worked perfectly out of  failed verification after burning
additionally the packaging doesnt have a hard plastic cover  its just all held up by a piece of glossy wrapper so the top  or so cdrs were already scratched and the clear plastic cdr top cover had  cracks
i verified that the  cds that failed verificaiton indeed hang upon transfergoing back to philips or another brand
memorex  never again it used to be good years agoi have never had a huge problem burning music onto cdr discs till i purchased these memorex
i am an avid amazon customer but i did not purchase these from them
i still felt i owed it to all buyers to warn them
had i bought them from amazon i would have been able to return them hassle free with the huge problems i encountered
regretfully i purchased a  spindle of these memorex cdr discs somewhere else and  out of  have been unusable and turned into everready coasters
i have a great hp computer with a superb recording drive andd also use roxio as my main recording source
over the past  years i have used many different brands from name brands to store brands and honestly never had problems other than the rare and random fluke bad cd
but here whenever i go to record my own playlist the cds have a mind of their own and will burn some of the songs but not all
like everyone else i thought it was me until i realized howe many hours and discs i had gone through
i tried burning through itunes as well as roxio and i am not a novice
i do know what i am doingso does anyone out there want  coasters
i wont even attempt using these ridiculously subpar cdr discs
and as one other reviewer said items such as this really are basically a  or  star product
if you purchase a  spindle pack and have  discs that may not work that is a  star product but if you use over  of them and  do not work as is my new score at the time of finalizing this review that is in no way anything above a  star product
please be kind to yourself avoid the hassle and purchase another brand
last note i found a cdr review site that categorized excellent quality medium quality and bad quality cdrs and memorex was on the bad list
and remember amazon sells the product but is not responsible for its subpar performancei archive backups to my system on these and so fill the disks to capacityevery time i tried to fill a disk it would failthis is trashbtw i tried them on my wifes laptop and same thingi bought a spindle of these in  and had no real problems with them
in december  i bought a new pack and noticed that the cds smelled of solvent or plasticizer and had irregular lumpy edges
ive had errors on each of the first five discs i have attempted to burn
with my previous batch i had a very low error rate
unless memorex raises their qc standards i would recommend trying your luck with a different manufacturer
with an  for  record so far i have to give this product one starwhat an atrocity these discs are
i have three different cd drives plextor pxsa fw rev  plextor pxa  fw rev  toshiba sdr fw rev unknownall discs were burnt on the pxsa
one burn failed couldve just been a bad disc it happens so im excluding that from my opinion
all burns were done at x occasionally ill use faster but i prefer less rereads when the discs are usedout of  successful burns  were readable by the pxsa  were unreadable by all drives including the pxsa
of the  which were readable only one of those was readable by a drive other than pxsabefore you say sounds like a plextor problem consider this i also use memorex mbminute x cdr media black discs purchased from amazon
i have yet to experience any problems with those discsthat said im left to believe these discs suffer from major compatibility problems completely unrelated to vendor
its possible i simply got a bad batch but the failure rate is completely unacceptable its wasted money and wasted timeas someone in the it industry i need to be able to burn a disc at an acceptable speed x and haul that disc to a colocation facility to install an operating system on a server
i dont like burning a disc then driving  minutes only to find the media itself has failed meavoid these particular memorex discsbought a  pack and the first three wouldnt work in  different macs so i just plan on returning the lot and getting some imations insteadthis is by far the worse cd i ever used
the majority were bad out of the package
will never buy this brand ever again
horrible producti have been using sony cdrs for years now without any problems
however when i stumbled across some very bad reviews of sony here on amazon i decided to give memorex disks a try when i saw them on saleboy i should have listened to myself when i said i was going to stick with sony
not one of the memorex cdrs would burn using my dell pc
i went through about  in a row
not one
the minute i popped in a sony disk it burned as smooth as butter so i knew it couldnt be corrupted data as the problem it had to be the memorex disks
i immediately dumped the brand new memorex spindle with the remaining  blank cds in the trash
 at least it was a very good sale wasted
i didnt even bother testing the others
i wouldnt buy a computer with the expectation that it will only work  of the time and i dont buy disks with the same expectation
when i buy something new i expect  of it to work  of the timeperhaps it is true that some disks will not work on all machines
who knows
all i know is memorex doesnt work on mine but sony has worked flawlessly on every computer and cd player i have ever used them on
so thats it for me
i will never deviate from what i know to be true again
for all i know memorex reps could be the ones writing those bad reviews of sony
lolsony has been infallible for me and with sony i shall remain
memorex is in the trash right where it belongsi have used memorex in the past with no problems
i bought a couple  packs spindles and burned abour  of them with no problem
then the next one failed at he beginning of recording and the next and the next and the next
in all i have had about  failures in a row on both my laptop and desktop computers
at first i thought my burner went bad but i tried some fuji disks that i had recording the same thing and they worked every time
i can not record any music or data files on these memorex disks
even if memorex would replace them i want something i can trustthis is my experience i was making a few cds and noticing that many of the songs i recorded on them particularly those at the end of the disc skipped and popped a lot basically rendering the whole cd worthless
after spending several hours rebooting my machine and checking all of the hardware to see what the problem was i figured id try another brand of cdrs and eureka
i was able to churn out a bunch of cds with no problems whatsoeverits a bit surprising that a brand name like this puts out such lowquality cdrs
i ended up throwing away at least half of these cdrs i tried to record before just pitching the entire spindle after i got this other brandso if youre having trouble burning cds check what kind of disc you are using first before wasting time checking to make sure your computer equipment is okaythinking memorex will be of good quality and there would least chances of coasters i bought  spindles  cdrs each i have tried variety of drives io magic mad dog and micro advantage i have always used roxio media creator  with the above combination i have been successful in burning one out of  or  discs mostly i get media errors and some weird errors the th or th cd that burns takes atleast  minutes
funniest thing is the free after rebate cdrs burn past  minutes and wo no errors absolutely and perform beautifully
if you are thinking of storing and preserving precious datavideo please go for tdkverbatimwhat more can i say the card received moderate use in a canon d and has developed areas where any pictures written there are corruptedfor the price this bag is great
because of the size of todays handycams digital cameras cell phonesetc
youll find they can all fit into this one bag which makes it easy to carry them all carry on airplane when on vacationi bought this for two reasons the previous samsonite bag i bought samsonite worldproof  blueblack deluxe slr digital or compact camera bag is sturdy and very good reviews from others with average rating of i just received it and is a total useless product
i would never expect such a product from samsonite
here is what i could find in few minutes walls of the bag are very thin bend like papers the zippers are not good the front pocket does not have a zip  what do you expect to put there
its no good for anything other than big items like battery charger cables etc the adjustable partitions inside the bag are also not sturdygo for samsonite worldproof  blueblack deluxe slr digital or compact camera bag even if it is  to  more
do not risk your camera or camcorderdrive i had fail shortly after  year and there is only a  year warranty
buy seagate drives with the  year warranty you wont be disappointed
i am waiting for my  other ide wd drives to fail so i can replace these  drives also with seagate drives these drives are as bad as maxtorok so when i built my machine in oct  i bought  of these drives and never needed the nd onenever even formatted it
so a couple weeks ago my primary just dies with no warningeven spinrite couldnt do anything with it after  weeks of running
so at least i have the nd drive to use right
wrong the nd drive that was never used died too
my bad for installing the nd drive before i needed it but i didnt realize that they spin constantly whether being used or not
so  drives died at the exact same time
ill never purchase another wd productif youre ok with using just your mouse on one pc andor just your keyboard on another this is kinda fun
otherwise avoid it
maybe i just got a bad one of course but i can assure you as a qa engineer that mine is no goodsorry i ever laid eyes on this turkeyabsolutely could not get it to work so i stuck it on ebayperson who bought it asked for a refundshe couldnt make it work eitherdont waste your time or money buy a logitech harmony insteadi second what an electronics fan said
i went through  headsets before finally giving up
i too was disappointed with the comfort of the earpiece
they kept coming out when i tried to run
the first two headsets i had to replace because the rubber ear pad kept falling off
they stay on for about    weeks but once the thing falls off and if your lucky enough to not lose it completely the thing never stays on
the third head set i added a little super glue two the rubber pieces before using and that seemed to do the trick until a couple month later when the left ear piece began cutting in and out
dont waist the money its not worth the hasslethis is not a touch lamp though product description says so
read the most recent reviews
of about  or so reviews since may   as many as  says this lamp is not a touch lamp
nevertheless amazoncom keeps selling it as a touch lamp
ive been a satisfied amazoncom buyer for many years but this is the first time i have encountered something as bad as thisit is a pretty lamp and is probably worth the price if you dont mind turning it on and off using the conventional switch on the cord
but look for something else if you want a touch lamp
i have returned it for a refunddespite the description this is not a touch lamp
there is a switch and it offers only one level of brightnessi have an imac  ghz  aluminum mac os x leopard and a  gb ipod classic
when the ipod is plugged into the linksys hub itunes reports that the ipod is connected to a lowpower lowspeed usb  hub
very disappointing
this hubs going back to amazonthis printer worked great for  months ink was fine nice photo quality on printsnow everytime i try to print the paper jams
i made sure the rollers are fine and unpluggedreset printer
even tried different paper
nothing works this printer is not worth purchasing for  months of useive had this for a little over  years
the first few months when i first purchased the printer it worked fine
i had a canon printer prior this and i was looking for a printer that will save me money on ink unlike the hp printers ive owned
i was proven wrong
this doesnt save me anything
the printer head stopped working and i had to replace it
took me awhile to figure that out ive bought inks after ink and it wont print anything it would always come out blurred out and as if it ran out of ink when i just literally installed a new one
youd have to replace the printer head for it to work again
found and bought one on ebay for 
ink isnt cheap and it doesnt last very long
when its working it works ok but youd be better off investing your money on something else that wont waste your money on ink and all the trouble of replacing the print headmy parents unfortunately bought this without consulting me firsti know a few people who buy these kodak machines and theyre doa or simply didnt function well at all
this one makes weird noises the paper jams constantly the paper tray design makes it easy to push it in too far and then the printer tries to take  sheets of paper at once choking to death on itwhen this printer does work it often whirrs for  minutes doing whoknowswhat
or it spits the page out immediately
you just dont knowi have read consistently bad reviews for this line for over  years now
great idea but bad execution
i cannot believe kodak still sells these things
they break within months if not doa out of the box
and kodak sends you a refurb which is even worse
you cant fix a bad design  itll fail eventually
its everything  the paper handling and the sensors are the main problemive found the canon mp series to be quick and reliable with rd party ink here on amazon to be on par with the price of these kodak inks and the prints are better
i know because ive abd them side to sidethis kodak is going to be returned asapive had this printer for about  years
it was quite nice at the beginning but then the ugly side of it showed up after a few months
dont believe the reviews of new owners  take a look at these important points from someone whos had it awhile if you run out of either the black and white cartridge or the color cartridge nothing will work
explain to me why you need ink in order for the printer to scan
yes i was severely agitated on my trip to buy a new cartridge before i could scan my expense report for work
no doubt i was just lining the pockets of kodak that day
 there is no printer monitoring built in
if you want to know how many pages that you printed since your last cartridge you had better put a manual clicker next to the printer
why would kodak not put the proof into the pudding by showing you how little ink it uses
simple  because the savings arent really there
 the wireless worked fine when i got it but then i had to regularly uninstall and reinstall the print drivers so the printer can find the computers on my network
i replaced the router and i was still having this issue with  pcs
ridiculous
i finally plugged the thing directly to my router with a cable to fix this
dont count on wireless to worki hope you have better luck with this thing
if i could still return it i wouldthree and a half years and dead
plus the fact that everytime the printer thought the ink cartridges were empty it would quit printing and you cannot empty them completely
no more expensive printers for mefinal review as of  avoid this productbought this at walmart yesterday
it does black  white prints fine
the scanner is okay except the scan bar has no depth perception and you get lost focus around  inch away from the glass so no scanning watches or flowers
now onto the bad things
firstly the color rendering is off
way off
a fix is to firstly install the firmware update through kodaks aio home center in the start menu under kodak
once installed the duplexing should work slightly better not chopping off an inch of your print jobs on pageflip
with the default install you will have severely desaturated reds about  the saturation of an onscreen or scanned red color and your blue colors will be muddy
then for the second part of the fix in the startsettingscontrol panelprinters and faxes click kodak esp office  series aio then click preferences not printing preferences
this will bring up a window with  tabs on top click advanced then in that tab print processor click nf emf  you can alter the color management color space profiles but this printer will only use an adobe colorspace or the default srgb even if youve set it differently
after this your reds will be deep and less like a faded pale orange color
your colors will still suck though as your reds finally being actually red now will be too dark and unsaturated
if you are using irfanview  as your image viewer then you need to go to color corrections and bump the saturation to  to  about  more and then you will have a reasonable color match to the reds you see on your screen and that is with blowing out the contrasts to heck on the reds
using the kodak special paper might automatically print normally given the yellow pattern indicating that it is kodak paper but i am using plain paper and this should not be a problem on any reasonable desktop printer
note that ive skipped over the failure to resize booklet pages properly although they do print in the correct order and orientation and the problem with the automatic paper feeder for the scanner on top but that is because i am limited on text in review posting and the biggest problem needed addressing first
i have not used the fax part of the printer or the wifi
had  image link examples to imageshack here they were removed when the review was posted  filling in space with color examples that users can duplicate onscreennote that the paper output looks fairly close to the onscreen version but i have to desaturate the newly scanned image by  to get match to the printed image it increases the red amount in scanning
this is also not a perfect color match as ive only had the printerscannerfax for about  hours to try to work past its quirks
this also shows that the printer can print proper red colors but it either refuses to or the colorspace matching is horrifically bad
the red of his boots should be  red  green and  blue rgb as it is onscreen in the first print the red is either underprinted or shifted too high to the  red  green  blue rangergb    rangefor example if you print a tomato red color from the screen rgb or hue saturation lightness hsl    the color this printer will output will be closest to rgb    or hsl    in short awfuladding onto my review a few weeks later
still no fix for the awful color rendering from kodak the scam of if you run out of color ink the printer will refuse to print black  white prints is proven true
in short the printer would be tolerably great if the kodak companys management could stop the selfdestructive scams against their customers and get the engineers to properly get their hardware working
i will not purchase another kodak product again until they clean up their act and stop the scams
one quick firmware fix would undo most of the problems with this printerscanner combo but from what i see kodak desires all of their nowformer customers to flee angrily into the night and tell their friends and everyone else on the internet you know the entire world about the products that should technically perform correctly but are prevented from operating properly thanks to kodaks anticustomer managerial scamsthe hardware still allows this product to remain a great printer it just needs some hacking to disable the criminal kodak management scams to fix the colorrendering incompetence and so the hardware performs as it was sold to me on the box
avoid this product until someone competent hacks it to make it act properly
i would suspect the horrible color rendering is magically fixed when printing on kodaks expensive preprinted yellow dot pattern paper which again is another scam
get your act together kodak or all the money in the world wont save you from the growing anger of your cold betrayal of your customers trust and the devaluation of your brand namefinal update on this review  ink usage and costswell the red no longer prints at all and cleaning the printhead only wastes ink
of the pages ive printed recently using a brand new standard black ink cartridge  and a brand new standard color ink cartridge  here are your results
black cartridge reported empty with  text pages black ink at  coverage  pages black ink graphics at  coverage  pages color at  coverage  pages color calibration with  coverage  ink cartridge cleaning cycles reported online to waste  of the ink each usage
small wonder the scam company of kodak is going bankrupt no more cartridges in the future kiddies and i say good riddancei purchased this printer in august   first off the wifi is difficult to setup and then only works when it decides to work
i ran out of paper very first tray which was  pages and refilled with new paper and from that point on it would not print it only gave a low ink message regarding the color ink cartridge
called kodak and got some guy from india that rolled his tongue with every word and could not understand a thing he had to say
he had a new print head sent to me which did nothing to solve the problem
did a google search and found countless complaints about this printer
kodak advertised this all winter spring and summer hooting and tooting about low ink cost  for black and bragging about getting  pages of print for a low five bucks
the price of that cartridge has doubled now and i only got around  pages
they also fail to mention that one is using up color ink at the same time you are using black ink
i never printed anything that was in color and still the thing ran out of ink
i sent kodak an email about this and got a very vague reply with a customer support call back numberguess where
india
so not only can you not understand their support people they also expect one to place an international call to boot
customers need to give kodak a real raking over the coals with this one it is a terrible product and the absolute last kodak product i will ever purchasehave had this machine for light printing and convenience of fax and scan
was very happy with it no big issues
then an error code appears that there is a printhead carriage jam 
there was nothing jamming
called kodak got a polite person who was going through the motions
after a  few trials she says that she needs to check further
comes back and says that the unit needs to be replaced but its out of warranty
i fully understand the warranty issue
my rating is based on a machine reaching a point where the manufacturer says it needs to be replaced after very light usage
even though ive had the machine for about  months ive only gone through  sets of cartridges
guess i should have printed more so it would have broken down sooner
the conspiracy side of me wants to say that these machines are programed for failure
a very similar issue happened with the hp i replaced with this kodakdec   initially i liked the printer very much see belowbut it is now  months old and will not print correctly missing colors missing textnumbers lines across photos etc etc
i have replaced cartridges more than once and alignedcleaned printhead more than once
its no help
kodak supposedly is ending me a new printhead under warranty in a few days
in meantime i will be looking at other brands of printersept   having been an hp officejet all in one printer user for more than a dozen years i was somewhat reluctant to leave the hp world and try another brand but am very glad i did
the kodak  is easy to set up and use a bit noisier than the hp but seems just as fast and print quality is more than acceptable
am looking forward to the lesser print costs that consumer reports found in its recent article
i use the printer with a usb cable so cant comment on wireless modedont plan on using this printer with any linux system  simply amazing that kodak is incapable of accommodating simple lpd printing via tcp or unix spooling systems cups would be preferredto be honest i had very high hopes for this kodak allinone printer
this was supposed to have been a move up from the dell printer i had that was supposed to have been wireless but kept losing its wireless connectivity every time i turned the printer on
after a while the wireless feature on it didnt work at all and eventually it became useless to me
their expensive ink cartridges was another huge turn off
so i decided to go with kodak who bragged about having inexpensive ink cartridges
yes that was the nugget that pulled me inwith this kodak i never had problems with the wireless feature and i never had to reset it once since setting it up
i can press print downstairs on my laptop and go upstairs and the document would be in the tray waiting for me to pick up
although the connectivity is flawless the ink is a joke
it runs out too quickly
one of the things i liked about my last dell printer even though the ink was expensive is that i can still use the black ink even if my color ink cartridge was completely gone
i was able to use one cartridge without a problem
yes it would keep giving me notifications that the color ink needed to be replaced but it would continue to print just using the black ink
this was a plus for me because i rarely print anything in color
if i would have known that the kodak all in one didnt have this simple feature i surely would have chosen another printer instead of this one
now i have two new black cartridges one in the kodak printer and a printer that refuses to let me bypass the fact that i need to replace the color cartridge
if someone found a way where i can do this then let me know and i will be fair to amend my review but thus far i cant find out how to do it
in the meanwhile i cant print anything until i order another color ink cartridge
bomberits very frustrating when you have full black ink cartridges and you cant use them because your color ink cartridges are low
this is the first printer ive owned that refuses to print in black and white
btw when my printer said that the color ink cartridge needed to be replaced i had barely used it which caused it to dry out
after i leave this review im going to do research for another printer
i really wish all of these reviews existed when i was considering purchasing this printer because it would have saved me tons of migrainesupdate i ordered a spanking new kodak color ink cartridge for this printer and guess what it doesnt print after i calibrated the new cartridges
if you are going to purchase this printer just because you think you will be saving money on the ink cartridges dont fall for that garbage
if youre like me who only prints occasionally this is not the printer for you
why
by the time you do get around to printing anything your kodak cartridges would have dried up and it would be virtually useless
at least my expensive dell wouldnt do this
you would be spending tons of money just to keep replacing these cartridges
also this stupid thing still somehow prints using some of the color ink even when your document is in black and white
now how stupid is this
this will cause your color cartridge to go low and eventually you wont be able to print at all even if you have a full black ink cartridge
if i knew then what i knew now i would have avoided this printer like the plague
who the heck designs a printer that doesnt give you the option of using either the color or the black cartridge
i plan to stay away from kodak printers periodupdate again stay far away from this printerafter using the clean printer heads feature constantly because i couldnt get the printer to print after inserting new cartridges the print comes out fuzzy and basically unreadable
this is so disappointing
this printer is total garbage
im looking for another printer
this was will be on the curb waiting for the garbage manupdate changed both cartridges and the printer is virtually useless
this is very disappointing because i rarely used this and my son now has to go to his college library in order to print his papers because this printer useless to us now
i went thru the clean printer heads feature over and over
i know customer service wont help based upon every elses experience with them so i wont botherthose of you who just purchased this printer and say that its a real bargain and you are pleased with it ill give you a year before you come back to update your review and change your  stars to  star
when you eat your way thru colored ink that you dont use even when youre not printing anything in color this printer uses it anyway and find out when the color is finished you cant use the black ink by itself and your cartridge heads fail or you have to keep purchasing color ink everytime you purchase black ink you will then wish you had gone by these reviews here
personally i wish i could give this  stars because it was a huge waste of money for me
kodak is bankrupt
stay away from their products
their commercials are not running on tv any longer for a reason
buyer be very awarethis review will receive no more updates from me
i thought i could troubleshoot it some more but its a dud
again buyer be very aware
stay far away from this potential troublemakerthe first z i received was doathe rightfront channel was dead right out of the box
i didnt know this until i had drilled holes in my walls ran the wire and set up the whole system
but amazoncom true to its excellent ways with customers had a second z on my doorstep in about  days
i was thrilled
so i set up this second system turned it on and was so happy to hear the wonderful sound out of all the speakers
this happiness turned to rage about  minutes later when a buzzing sound started up getting louder as the system heated up
the next day i tried again and after a few minutes i heard a pop and several of the channels went dead
so this system went back too
being an electrical engineer and having worked with pcs since the early s i pretty well know what im doing when it comes to connecting components to pcs
i know my sound card a creative sound blaster audigy  is functioning properly
i have excellent surge supprssion in my power supply
this leaves only the z to blame
i can only suspect that what logitech is sending to amazon to offload on its customers is not the same quality or tested units that have won logitech such positive reviews
not willing to go through the hours of hard work involved in the unpacking installation uninstalling repacking and reshipping again i decided to go with my second choice the creative megaworks   system
this system worked right out of the box and has continued to give me much that i expected to get from the zim not happy not to have gotten the z system
it has features that i would prefer over the creative system
having worked so closely to both the z is much more robust and has the digital output and a true remote control
the  minutes of sound that i had from the second z system was superb
i truly wish i was now listening to the z system not because i have any complaints about the creative megaworks thx   but because of what the z has that the megaworks does notits a buy for the money
but does not connect to my mac steadily which needs frequent restarting of  my mac
finally i had to buy a usb keyboard
so am not happy with its reliabilitylow price free shipping from hong kong
it worked for few months and it is now dead
tried to reset re seat retried on different computer but is is still belly up
what i could complain cheap thing from china anyway 
do not buy itkeyboard works however mouse is not recognized
i purchased  and all five of them have the same problem
software does recognize a usb compliance mouse device however mouse clickmovement does not register at allfake advertising about how it would work on kvm
it does notgot trendnet usb to ps converter tups white  instead works wonderfullyi have a kinesis ps contoured keyboard which is admittedly a little unusual but another adapter i have works fine
this one does not work at all
at least its cheap enough that trying didnt cost muchif you order you have to wait for it to ship from overseas
 month in my case
then the big disappointment
the computer will recognize the adapter but not the devices connected keyboardmouse i bought  of the because they were so cheap
all five are now in the trash
waste of time and moneypro  its cheapcons  it didnt work and wasnt fully assembled on arrival
it took  days to arriveedit  im typing this on the sanoxy usb to ps adapter
i pried it apart with nothing more than my fingernails
where the problem was immediately obvious a wire was not soldered to the fingernail sized circuit board
pulling out my trusty soldering iron and attaching the needle tip the board was properly soldered in  minutes
still rating as a star since diy do it yourself was not in the descriptioni bought these hoping i could attach my kvm switch to some new hp servers
the servers just dont see them
i have no idea if they will work on anything else but server  r doesnt recognize themthe reason i purchased this was to use for my symbol ls barcode scanner through my usb ports
doesnt do thathave used similar products before but this item wouldnt work at all for menow im typing more words because i didnt have enough to publish la la laperhaps because it contains both keyboard and mouse connectors my computer does not recognize the keyboard at boot
at any rate didnt work for meive been trying to find one of these adapters that would work on either or both of my dell servers pe t and pe sc which are controlled by a kvm switch with ps connections
after waiting a couple of weeks for shipping from hong kong this adapter would not work on either system
i even tried it on an asus mb in my selfbuilt htpc and it was nogo on that unit as well
i have found a couple of adapters that do work on all of these systems and have been trying to source a rd so i can quit swapping the working ones around
the item is too inexpensive to send back as the postage will exceed the costi was looking for a way to hookup an old ps kjeyboard to my new laptop
i only needed it because i had previously by hand put shortcut stickers on them for my djing app
the keyboard works fine when connected to any one of the tower pcs in this homethey mailed iot to me  jan and it finally arrived today feb
and will not work is not compatable with windows  or above
ild send it back but the postage is more than i paid so i stuck with itoh wellone of the very few things i ever got though amazon that totally sucked
not  even worth a phone call  dont order iti tried it on a new unicomp keyboard and an older ibm model m  it wouldnt work on either
my unit could be doa but not worth sending backmouse side was ok keyboard side did not work and computer figured this out during the post processpower on self test
a cheap piece of junk
try the belkin version
worked perfectlythis lens cover will never holds its place on a canon glass  its always loose and doesnt lock  can never match the original cover that comes with the lens  dont waste your money while an attractive package with built in wireless blue tooth b fingerprint recognition for enhanced security and easy login hp has in fact delivered a messthe saga thus far  upon delivery the unit was delivered with a stack of supplement manuals and addendums describing the addon features however there was no manual for the pocket pc  operating system
the manual is  pages and hidden on the cd as a pdf file although my first round with tech support couldnt find it on the cd and pointed me to the web site  where he couldnt find it either
it was explained to me that the os is provided by a third party vendor microsoft and therefore hp isnt responsible for it
right  never mind that it is essential to the unit and is useless without it
further attempts to move the pdf to the ipaq so it can be read with adobe acrobat reader for the pocket pc when needed proved useless
i personally think this is inexcusable  i shouldnt have to download the file to a pc keep the pc with me at all times so i can have access to it when i have a problem with the pocket pc  or print out a  page book on   x  inch paper and figure out how to carry it with me
kind of defeats the purpose of having a pocket pc
the unit needs to be delivered with this basic toolnext the unit filed after  hours of use
it turned itself on while in my briefcase got extremely hot and completely locked up
the  would not reset
turns out that hp will not send a replacement unless you want to pay for an additional warranty so it disappeared for a week and a half vice the  days that were promised when i called technical support
when it was returned i was informed that they couldnt duplicate the error so they did nothing
i have since determined that the optional leather executive case sold by hp was designed so that it can readily touch the overly sensitive power switch  turning the unit on so it will overheat and run the battery dead
if i dont use the  leather case sold by hp for the  it is much less prone to turning itself on and overheatingthe handwriting recognition is poor and difficult to tailor
as often as not the unit will not exit the keyboard mode without a system reset
btw i find i do  resets a day at this point between this problem memory card problems and wireless problems
as for the wireless  i have gottent it to work exactly once
after numerous calls to technical support i have managed to get it to work with one of four wireless networks
according to tech support the unit will not tolerate g in the area
they consider it a problem with the g standards never mind that my other b devices are working with no difficulty
it gets worse
the configuration for each network involves multiple control panels that are scattered throughout the os counterintuitive and poorly documented
you wont gett any help from the faqs or technical support web site either
for instance if you should manage to get the wireless to recognize a network you then need to go through the network settings control panel and indicate in three different dropdown boxes that you are connecting at work rather than the internet or home
use of any other setting will effectively prevent the device from using the wireless and requires you to configure a modem never mind that the whole point of wireless is to avoid using a modem or you may need different wireless configuration settings at different locations
why workwireless has yet to be explained to me by technical support
clear yet
i thought notthe latest saga has to do with the sd memory card
it cannot be written to or have the existing files deleted
suspecting a corrupt file i tried to find information on formatting the card or any other information on the memory cards on the hp web site
there was none
when i called technical support they informed me that every sd card needed to be formatted before it was used
again nothing in the user guide or the web site
further there was no utility provided by hp to do this
i needed to go to a another vendors web site and buy this utility separately even though it was required before i could use the card  even the one hp sold me with the 
despite my better judgment i bought the utility  and low and behold  it doesnt work either
again how hp can justify not including a basic utility that is required to use the device eludes mefinally this was one of two units i bought for evaluation in my laboratory
the other i gave to my network systems engineer
his story isnt any happier
in addition to the issues i have encountered his problems have centered around that expansion pack and the fact that they are such a poor fit that the unit constantly sees the battery in the expansion pack as going dead because it fits so poorly that the unit keeps shutting down
any devices plugged into the expansion pack are constantly seen as being removed and installed  requiring numerous resets as things try to reloadwe have also bought the new viewsonic pocket pcs and casios for evaluation
they have been an order of magnitude more reliable that the hp ipaq  despite because fewer features and further came with complete documentation
none of these have failed to date nor have we had an issue requiring our contacting technical supportour conclusion the hp ipaq  is a poorly executed design lacking basic documentation with poor support and should therefore be avoided at all coststhis device has a problem maintaining a wlan connection
memory errors while using the wireless connection require a neverending series of soft resets
just when you think the need for soft resets are slowing along comes a datalosing hardresetim entirely disappointed in the ipaq
i went into it believing it would be faster and more fullfeatured than my palm
this has simply not been the case
everything runs slower and requires more resets of the device
even when i have the wlan hooked to my dsl connection at home the web browsing is dog slow 
really huge disappointment
i cannot think of anyone but a true techy who is in love with ipaqs and has to have the latest model who would get their moneys worth out of thisthere are far far far better pda models that are out there
dont let the promise of the latest pocket pc platform fool you
the  is far slower and less stable than other competitors
beware month updatehave started to use this device fairly heavily
turned off the wlan
that seems to resolve a substantial number of locking issues
soft reset the device fairly regularly
have found some great applications for calendar and that is what has kept me using it
screen on this is nice as welldoes not hold a quot screen portable dvd player as advertised
i bought this case for my toshiba sdp portable dvd player with an quot screen and its too large to fit in this caseroutinely looses major parts of the signallike color
picture looks like black and white with green tint
power off and on and it is fine for a few minutes
full of odd user interface hangs
press a key not anticiptaed in the current menu and you have to power off to get it back
typical of my experience with samsung productspoor software engineeringthis coax cable seems to be well made its very flexible and was easy to install
i used this cable to replace an old cable that had to be spliced to make it long enough
much to my surprise the cable exhibited terrible signal loss it decreased from dbi to dbi
i wound up having the cable company come out to install their shielded rg cable and there wasnt any signal loss at all
buyer bewaregot a pack of  of these to burn playlists for xmas gifts thinking sony would be better than the staples or memorex brands which i did not recognize
wow did i ever go wrong
these made a racket in my cd burner before ejecting
eventually some worked most didntreturning these tomorrowi bought the exact same spindle at office depot for only  dollars i now know why they were so cheap
i have a x burner and tried to burn several at that speed the cds are supposed to be x compatible none of them were readable
i had to burn at x for any of the cds to work
i would suggest instead buying memorex ive found spindles of  cds for  in some stores and ive never had a single bad cd
im surprised by the quality of sonys cds especially since ive read elsewhere that they are supposed high qualitygranted this is an old review from  maybe sony has improve on thier cd since then but i have not use them sinceplease do not buy look for a different brand
you will lose datai am furious how many sonys cdrs i have replaced
they are the absolute worst product out there
i dont know how such a great electronic company would leak such low quality unreliable cdr  the problem i have with sony is overtime the cds become unreadable
it said not msdos error or something when you try to copy the data basically it become unreadable
the surface of sony cdr is a smooth pearl
after  years they start to fake off on the edge like watermark
not because of careless but of the cdr surface quality
other cheaper cdr i have for  years storage in the same location as the sonys cdr are still readable and dont fake
i lost some important data with at least  sonys cdr
the files at the outer edge are affected the mosti though the smooth pearl color of sony was very pleasing compare to other ugly blank cdr
tdk is now my cdr of choice now
it has a clean look and it cdrs are more readable on any cdrom then sony
i am in a progress of reburning all data that are on the sony to tdk
again warning do not buy sonys cdrmore than  of these discs fail when attempting to write them
ill never buy sony cd rom discs again
this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleadingi had endless problems backing up to sony cds
switched to tdk and almost always works fine
stay away from sony cdsafter  out of  burns resulted in errors i thought that something might be amiss
sure enough there was these discs are worthless
ive never seen anything like this really especially from a well known electronics company like sony
steer way clearpiece of junk
i used it for  months without incident but it always ran hot not warm hot
i came down one morning and the kvm switch was so hot it burned my hand
went to check my computer and found the kvm literally fried my ms keyboard and ms optical mouse on ps adapter  keyboard dead  ms mouse had a melt mark underneath no joke
thier tech support is overseas ergo terrible i sat on hold forever trying to get an rma
all i really wanted was to make them aware that this switch is possibly a manufacturer defect and quite possibly a fire hazard
they claim no one ever called to complain about it before
amazons review section proved them wrong and i told her soi went with an iogear kvm switch at half the price
if that one dies im going with a hard wired kvm box for more money intead of these all in one switch units i think itll be worth the piece of mind since i use my computers for a living at home
i cant take the risk some junky cable could destroy my livelihood while i sleeplinksys claims they never heard any issues with this unit overheating or melting down components but if you search the web youll find lots of my computer will not post connected to linksys kvm switch
this thing is overpriced garbage and a fire hazard as far as im concerned
avoid cheaply made overpriced junk like thisi received it today and connected it to my primary pc
as described in the manual the little green light lit up
a few moments later the little green light went out
after that the little switch never came back to life
the keyboard and mouse would not respond
never attempted to connect my second pcthe receptacles for keyboard and mouse are not snug enough to securely capture the plugs
any movement of the switch will dislodge the plugsworked fine just not for very longwhile this product worked with my new custom p  ghz and my older custom pii it failed miserably with a gateway p and the same pii
the mouse was not recognized on the gateway the keyboard would not work with the mouse plugged into the kvm and the monitor went black with each keystroke even after removing the mouse
i tried several different configs even different mice with no success
i took it to work where i have  gateway piis and it failed with them as well
before you blame gateway i went and bought an io gear kvm for  including an audio connector
we use io gear  port boxstyle switches at work with great success
the  port mini kvm from io gear worked flawlessly
linksys site doesnt even list the kvm as a product they sell
stay away from this onebefore i review the product itself let me just say how terrible the linksys  cisco support was when i called
when i got the obligatory indian support representative and after he asked me what the device i was calling about he said he was going to put me on hold so that he could validate the mumble
validate the what
 i asked
validate the mumble he said again
eventually i agreed to let him put me on hold but it was never clear what he was validating though i hear from people whove been there that in india its not uncommon for people to validate in ditches in public places
i guess for a  device i shouldnt expect topnotch technical support but i digresson the other hand i did expect the thing to work and it does 
sort of
the hardware i have isnt exactly brand x i have a microsoft manufacturer  dell reseller keyboard and a logitech trackman marble keyboard and im using windows xp
so this is pretty mainstream hardware and software were talking about
anyway to make a long story short despite getting no help from technical support they told me the device was defective and that i should return it i eventually got it mostly working
mostly meaning that it sometimes misses mouse clicks usually one of a pair of left doubleclicks you know the kind you use practically every minute that youre on your computer
if i click more slowly ie allow more time between clicks it works most of the time but what the heck is that about
its a hardware device for goodness sake i shouldnt be able to doubleclick too quickly
whats it doing anyway
validating
i guess my indian friend was right about one thing i do need to send it back
and i willi need several kvm switches of this general kind but need to find out if this permits the use of a ps to usb adaptertwo hours on the phone with some folks in bangalore or thereabouts has left me with more questions than answerswhy would we buy a product from ciscolinksys when their tech support people are so cluelesswhat i did not realize before picking this up is that unlike most ergonomic keyboards this keyboard is completely flat in fact it almost feels like it is bent in a tiny bit and doesnt sit comfortably in my hands
and the keys seem strangely sized especially the space bar and bottom row of keyshonestly i wish i hadnt gotten rid of the packingm because i went and picked up a microsoft natural ergonomic  and am much happier with itwow
maxtor is terrible
following all of their instructions to the letter i attempted to copy my wink sp system disk gb onto this newer larger drive
the first attempt took  hours and failed at  completion
when i attempted to perform the copy from within wink it took another  hours to complete
everything appeared fine until i attempted to boot off the new drive
nothingyesnothing
no recognized boot volumeworse yetmy original system disk was totally corrupted
my recently made repair disk failed
for every fixed file there was another one waiting
after several nights of trying every trick possible including analyzing the system on another wink machine i have given upthe drive itself worksso maxtor gets a  star
but their software violated the prime directive do no harmi have written to maxtor several times
eventually a human responded and said quotthe warranty says we are not responsible for any incidental or direct data lossquot
translation maxtor does not care what happens when you use their software
not only did they cost me gt hours of my life they refuse to compensate me in any way for their faulty software that corrupted my original perfectly fine system diskwell if they dont care how messed up your data is going to get why would i care to buy their products in the futureworthless garbage
some  skull candy earbuds have way better sound quality
these clunky audiotechnica athm head phones also broke not long after getting them so they were not as durable as i originally either
dont waste your moneythese quit working in less than  months of use
extremely disappointed
they are just junk now collecting dust in my home
i will never buy another audiotechnica product againi have had these for about a year
i also have mpoof
no sound
i have never had a pair of headphones to go out completely
some had shorts in the wire
some fizzled
never poof
no soundthese phones sounded very neutral which were great for listening to our studio recordings but they did not feel very sturdy on the head
seemed like the head band was too loose or unevenam i missing something here
the product details and other reviews seem like a joke
do i need to download something to utilize these headphones
my mdrv headphones i got  years ago work better than these and i think the bassstereo broke in one ear
plus they are more comfortableafter minimal use over the course of  months the cable produced a short near the plug
the springy metal next to the plug gave me the impression that would never even be an issue
apparently the purpose of the springy metal is for something else not to prevent a shortthese headphones are rated very well on amazon maybe i got a dudprice is good for an entry level lens but personally i really disliked it
i returned it after taking a couple test photos the focusing with the lens is in my opinion is louder than acceptable
i returned this and purchased the mm f lensi have had this lens and have used it maybe x the lens will not focus makes clicking noises i absolutely hate itgreat in total but very bad auto focus as much as i spend my time to tell you abut how much  am disappointed about focusing in low light situation keep searching  for the focus point till you turn it to manual and show it to her  but still great lens in that value of money sharp light like plastic toy fast i ordered this lens a few days ago
it came quickly
when i put it on my camera i was able to take a few pictures but then it just stopped
it said i needed to clean my lens contacts so i did
it still wont let me take any pictures though
i bought this as usedlike new
its not like new it doesnt even workfaulty
focus ring stuck
a lens should last years
not months
this is the second one that has failed and i have only used it once
i would not recommend this lens because it is apparently too fragile or has a manufacturer flawimmediately out of the box the lens was making grinding noises it had terrible auto focus and one month after purchase the lens housing actually fell out while on a shoot
embarrassing ridiculous unacceptable
piece of junki feel like i would have gotten better quality out of a tamroni bought this lens specifically because i had an opportunity to attend my first boxing event and needed a fast lowlight lens
this lens was highly recommended
when i received lens i took a few test shots and discovered the lens not as sharp as i had expected based on the comments in the evaluations
the kit lens on my canon ti was much sharperseveral days after lens arrived i attended the event
still in the first round of the first match camera in the continuous shooting mode i got a notice saying communication problem between lens and camera clean the lens contacts
i removed the lens wiped off the contacts assembled camera and lens and resumed shooting
almost immediately another notice and another cleaning
one more notice and cleaning and the camera stopped working
my only solution was to use the kit lens and the result as i feared is no useful shots
everything is pitch black as though the event was taking place at midnight on a very dark nightthe photos that i managed to take with the mm before it stopped working arent bad
because i was trying to shoot at  or  to stop the action in limited light they are somewhat dark but this can be corrected in photoshop elements
there is also some blurriness of the sort i experienced with the first test shots but i attribute this to a defect in this lens
what i am saying is that this lens seems to have been a good choice for my purpose but because it was defective i am giving this lens only  starlens is being returned to amazoni have ordered a lot from amazon over the years and always read the evaluations first
invariably no matter how many  and  star ratings are given a product there are at least a couple from people disappointed because product was defective
this seems to have been my turn to be one of those peoplei am a professional cinematographerand have owned several lens over the years
i dont get the positive reviews my lens is soft wide open and down a stop too at which point i might as well use my zoom lens and not risk dust on the sensor by taking the lens off
to me this lens is junk
i have shot over  time lapse sequences with dslr cameras love the canon dslr cameras just plan to sell the mm off soon
some people may have received a better copy
but when i shoot city lights from my house overlooking a city this lens has been the worst i have ever used
i make a living shooting beautiful images for stock footage sometimes with quite cheap glass so i was sad to see the resultsi shoot quite a bit at night in moonlit landscapes so i understand fast lens shot falls but this lens was terrible
i also only manually focus everything i use a hoodman loupe for all shots to check focus i nail focus better then using auto focus on every lens i own
so no auto focus issue just poor glassi dont mean to upset anyone who may like the lens just my professional two centsi bought the lens and inside the lens is waste  i can not believe amazon sells second selection things  warning i purchased this as an addition for my d equipment
i returned it the next day
the price should have been a tip off
it hunted in low light about  of the time and  in good light
it miss focused badly in more than have the  test exposures i took
the build quality is definitely canons low end feeling very plastic
it was also surprisingly noisy for such a small lens
ill stick with the higher end canon lenses like the l which i lovebeware
the lens gets stuck on the camera google  youtube
i didnt think mine would end up getting stuck but after  years owning it  it finally did
i had to break it in order to be able to use my camera againthe lens itself is amazing
gives really good picture quality
on a scale from one to ten i give it  only because the out of focus lights have a funny octagon shape
it is really loud when it tries to focus specially in low light
also when in low light if your iso is not high andor you have a full frame it misses focus often
trust me i used it for about a year so i know how it works
yes a year
to some that is a long time but it was only used lightly  one day out of the week because i work and not in photographyand when i got my flash and umbrella i started to used it often for the first timehighly not worth even  bucks yeah quality is high but it breaks with just one fall
mine fell from  feet high and it landed on my feet i looked and since i have dropped the camera from higher distances  didnt care
but when i looked again the tip of the lenses rolled in a separate direction after it landed on my feet
if you dont believe me the look for the drop te
